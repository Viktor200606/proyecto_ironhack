180
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:58,741
Wait, he might be in danger.

181
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:00,462
Is this the brother who steals cars?

182
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:01,982
Oh, no, Jay's the oldest.

183
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:04,319
- And you know how older brothers are.
- LUCIFER: Yeah.

184
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,300
- Oh. I'm an only child.
- Oh.

185
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,155
Well, Jay is the good one.

186
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:09,891
The one we all looked up to.

187
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,160
I mean, I know my
family's got its issues,

188
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:13,875
but not Jay.

189
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:15,997
I mean, he really made me believe

190
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,308
I could live a good life.

191
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,934
Mm, well, that's what eldest
brothers want you to think.

192
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:21,069
Always talking down to you

193
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,446
from their pedestals that
they put themselves on.

194
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,040
But when you need them to
help you kill someone...

195
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,776
[CHUCKLES] where are they then, hmm?

196
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,511
[SCOFFS]

197
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,748
We still don't know for sure, guys,

198
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,917
if he was even here.

199
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,417
- He was here.
- Maze,

200
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,699
I know you've got your
sources or whatever.

201
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:40,235
But I'm just saying, until fingerprint

202
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:41,604
and DNA analysis comes back,

203
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,507
- we don't know...
- I found his wallet.

204
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,660
Maze, where did you get that?

205
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:47,228
It was in the corner over there

206
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,958
when we first walked in.

207
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:50,470
What? He's still my bounty,

208
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:51,898
and I haven't found him.

209
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,534
CHLOE: "Jay Lopez."

210
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:55,239
It's your brother.

211
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,472
[SIGHS] Which means he's definitely...

212
00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:59,707
Not the killer!

213
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,909
Based on the blood spatter,
the bullet was fired

214
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,211
from this angle, right?

215
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:04,396
It looks that way.

216
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,714
But this looks like powder burn, okay?

217
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:09,917
So the only way to shoot
from this angle further back

218
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,130
would be if you were a lefty.

219
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,932
And... drumroll, please... my brother

220
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:15,223
is a righty.

221
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:17,810
So, obviously, there must
have been another person here.

222
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:19,510
Uh, okay. Okay.

223
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:23,130
Well, we'll start looking
for this left-handed shooter.

224
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,766
But, in the meantime,

225
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:27,201
I really think it's best for everybody

226
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:28,770
and-and your brother

227
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:31,973
if you just step away
from the investigation.

228
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:33,626
Okay, yeah. I-I get it.

229
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:35,229
But I'm gonna go and try to find Jay.

230
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:36,771
I really would prefer you don't.

231
00:08:36,774 --> 00:08:38,040
He could be in danger.

232
00:08:38,043 --> 00:08:39,142
Okay, I'll call you

233
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,781
if we find anything.

234
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:43,510
Great. Now that we're
done with that charade,

235
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:45,653
shall we track down Ms.
Lopez's murderous brother

236
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:46,821
before she does?

237
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:48,256
I trust Ella's instincts.

238
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:50,058
It does seem like there
was another person here.

239
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,125
So, just to be safe,

240
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:52,427
let's pursue both scenarios.

241
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:55,063
Brothers can't be trusted, Detective.

242
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:58,427
You're just delaying her
inevitable disappointment.

243
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:01,307
Maybe.

244
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,278
Maybe not.

245
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:12,647
I've been through some...

246
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:14,248
[SIGHS] trauma.

247
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,284
And I've been avoiding it. [CHUCKLES]

248
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:19,253
But, recently, um, events
have caused me to realize

249
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:20,822
that I need to...

250
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:22,824
face my fears.

251
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:26,127
Lucifer mentioned that you
worked wonders with him.

252
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:29,063
I mean, you see someone
who calls himself the Devil.

253
00:09:29,065 --> 00:09:32,633
So anything I say can't sound
too crazy, right? [CHUCKLES]

254
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,739
I haven't been to therapy before.

255
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:40,441
Is this where I start...

256
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:42,310
telling you what I'm going through?

257
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:44,521
Um...

258
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:45,927
a couple of months ago,

259
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,699
I had a near-death experience.

260
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:54,822
And I think that-that
when I was dead, um,

261
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:56,669
I think that I was in Hell,

262
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:59,527
- reliving the same nightmare...
- I can't help you.

263
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,028
Excuse me?

264
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,798
You need to leave.

265
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,299

No. I mean, I shouldn't be surprised.

Ever since he found
out he's Dad's favorite,

00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,638
he's been a bit of a dick.

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,619
- What do you mean?
- Well, lots of chest puffing

284
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:46,908
and peacocking.

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,974
I mean, even more than usual,
with that insufferably smug...

286
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:53,114
No, I mean, how do you know
that he's God's favorite?

287
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:55,184
It's a long story,
involving a flaming sword

288
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,794
and a space vagina.

289
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:58,219
But the quick version:

290
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:00,278
a book said it, so it must be true.

291
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:02,271
Anyway, not to worry.

292
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:05,200
I'll find a way to bring him round.

293
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,300
Our victim's Fahrid Nasser... he's
an international diamond salesman.

294
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:14,168
So it makes sense that
you'd find a loose diamond

295
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,311
in his office, but can you skip
to the part where you help us

296
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:18,544
track down Ms. Lopez's
disappointment of a brother?

297
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,474
I thought we were looking
for another suspect.

298
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:22,543
We are. Despite Lucifer's attempt

299
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:25,179
to make this case about what's
going on with his own brother.

300
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:26,981
- You were saying, Dan?
- Well,

301
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:29,489
it would make sense to find a
diamond in a broker's office,

302
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:31,185
unless that diamond was reported stolen.

303
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:32,416
Fortunately for us,

304
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:34,322
diamonds are pretty easy to track.

305
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:36,564
Each one of them has a serial number

306
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,259
laser-etched into it.

307
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:41,562
I usually get them to add crude
drawings to the back of mine.

308
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:43,831
- Where was it stolen from?
- A diamond boutique

309
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,410
in Beverly Hills. Here's the kicker...

310
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,634
Fahrid, our victim,

311
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:48,249
he's one of the store's
diamond brokers.

312
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:50,571
So, what, he sells to them,
uses that as a cover

313
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,607
- to the case the joint, then robs it?
- Maybe.

314
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:53,975
File on the robbery's pretty thin...

315
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:56,332
No security cameras, no witnesses,

316
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:57,889
- not a lot to go on.
- All right,

317
00:11:57,892 --> 00:11:59,647
well, maybe Fahrid had an accomplice?

318
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:01,115
That could be our other suspect.

319
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:03,444
Let's go to the jewelry
store, see if we can drum up

320
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,214
any new leads now that we
know Fahrid is involved.
