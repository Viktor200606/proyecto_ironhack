1
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,695
- Hey, Chlo.
- Hey.

2
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:24,351
No Lucifer tonight?

3
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:27,522
No. Actually, he and I aren't
working together anymore.

4
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:30,234
- What? For real?
- Yep.

5
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:31,695
What happened?

6
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,240
You know, I don't really
want to talk about it.

7
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,367
Okay.

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,995
You're okay though, right?

9
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:38,952
Totally. Totally fine.

10
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,456
You know, I was fine before
Lucifer, I'll be fine after.

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,168
It's really for the best.

12
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:45,902
Alright. No arguments from me.

13
00:00:45,904 --> 00:00:47,153
What do we have here?

14
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:48,071
Pablo Silva,

15
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:49,948
hotshot jewelry designer
from Beverly Hills,

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,533
- just back from the Middle East.
- Cause of death, pretty obvi.

17
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,202
Manual strangulation.

18
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:55,997
Not a fun way to go.

19
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,081
Unless it's your thing.

20
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,124
Ella found pistachio
shells under the body.

21
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,710
So weird, because there's no
pistachios anywhere on the plane.

22
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,629
But the cabin's full
of other great stuff.

23
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,506
Shrooms, weed, coke.

24
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:08,466
Might want to keep Lucifer
away from the evidence

25
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,928
if you don't want any to go missing.

26
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:13,807
Wait a second. Where is Lucifer?

27
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:16,393
He was decapitated?

28
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:18,601
No.

29
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:20,645
He's not going to be
working with us anymore.

30
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,398
- What?
- Let's just focus on the case, okay?

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,780
Who found the body?

32
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:26,901
Uh, over there.

33
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:29,965
Toby Golden? You co-owned
Golden Silva Jewelers with Pablo?

34
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:32,281
Yeah, we built it together, ground up.

35
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:34,909
Pablo handles creative,
I handle business.

36
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,244
Have you found the necklace?

37
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,370
- Not yet.
- What necklace?

38
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:40,623
Pablo was transporting our
latest piece, The Desert Mirage.

39
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:44,002
It's a $3 million original
he finished in Dubai.

40
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,128
Why Dubai?

41
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,505
It's where we get our best
deals, buying gold and diamonds.

42
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,881
And you were here to pick him up?

43
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:52,927
No. My assistant and I were
prepping for an investors' meeting

44
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:56,514
and I didn't hear his voicemail
until after we were finished.

45
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,059
I come racing down here and...

46
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:00,311
You know, I find him like this.

47
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,313
Can we hear that voicemail?

48
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,606
Hey, Toby. It's Pablo.

49
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:09,027
I messed up, man. I'm in some serious
debt with these dangerous dudes

50
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,112
and I kind of promised
to give them the Mirage.

51
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:13,279
They're on their way over
for it, but it's gone.

52
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,241
Someone must have...

53
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:17,326
Oh, no. They're already here.

54
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,329
Arabic.

55
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:21,205
Do you know who Pablo
was referring to there?

56
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,042
I didn't even know he was in
any kind of trouble until this.

57
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,210
Well, do you know
anyone who speaks Arabic?

58
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,504
A lot of our business associates.

59
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:30,925
Really? Great. Okay, we'll
need a list of those people.

60
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:33,623
Maybe Pablo's dangerous dudes killed

61
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,595
him because he didn't get their payment.

62
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:36,906
Wait, pistachios.

63
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,973
There's a thug that I heard of,
eats those things obsessively.

64
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:41,309
The dude definitely
qualifies as dangerous.

65
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,852
And guess what his first language is?

66
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:43,895
Please say Arabic.

67
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,314
Yep. A guy named Turkish Pete.

68
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,775
- But Arabic isn't Turkish.
- And Turkish Pete isn't Turkish.

69
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:51,069
He's the right-hand man for
an Arab criminal concierge

70
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,945
by the name of Bashir Al-Fassad.

71
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:55,531
It could be them. I'll take
a look, make some phone calls.

72
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:56,757
- Great.
- Alright.

73
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:58,960
You. Lucifer.

74
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:00,161
Spill.

75
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:02,491
- Oh, everything's fine.
- Nuh-uh.

76
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:06,044
You don't get to do that. Come
on, my sister sense is tingling.

77
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,600
Come on.

78
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:12,298
Lucifer and I had a bad fight.

79
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,634
It's okay. Fights are totally normal.

80
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:16,012
No, not this one.

81
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:19,347
He and I have some pretty serious issues

82
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:21,392
that I don't think can be resolved.

83
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:24,852
How is Lucifer handling it?

84
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:27,647
Well, I don't really
know, but it's Lucifer,

85
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:29,275
so I'm sure he is just fine.

86
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,401
Yeah. Sure.

87
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:38,535
Excuse me.

88
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,098
♪ You're no good, no good for me ♪

89
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,740
♪ And I'm no good for you ♪

90
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:51,607
Mr. Morningstar.

91
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:54,628
We're going to need those.

92
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,634
Not as much as I do.

93
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,762
Business is booming tonight.
You sure you don't want to stay?

94
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:02,016
Why on Earth would I want to do that?

95
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:12,795
Eve?

96
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,131
Hey, Luce.

97
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,240
Long time, no see.

98
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:25,842
You look great.

99
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:26,974
Yeah?

100
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:30,144
- Same as you did back then.
- Thank you.

101
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,678
So do you.

102
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:33,279
Better even.

103
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:34,567
Oh.

104
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,444
I must say, this is quite the surprise.

105
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,334
You, here.

106
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,408
Back here.

107
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,966
On Earth.

108
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:47,078
How?

109
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,621
Found a way out of heaven.

110
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,435
I didn't think that was possible.

111
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:51,582
For humans.

112
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,627
What can I say? I've always
been a bit of a rule breaker.

113
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,462
But you know that.

114
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:57,672
I do.

115
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,382
So I flew the coop.

116
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:03,219
Next thing I knew, I was
waking up in a dusty old tomb,

117
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:06,055
so I caught a plane
and came straight to LA.

118
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,390
Right.

119
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:08,683
And...

120
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:09,892
Adam?

121
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:11,519
Where's that barrel of laughs?

122
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,019
Still up there.

123
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:15,245
Where everyone is always so...

124
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:17,425
happy.

125
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:18,859
But not you?

126
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,152
Mm.

127
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:22,292
I always felt like something was...

128
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:23,531
missing.

129
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,326
People always forget...

130
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,577
I didn't choose Adam.

131
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:30,581
I was created for him.

132
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,213
Turns out an arranged existence kind
of takes the spark out of things.

133
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:42,051
We got along just fine, but...

134
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:45,179
I don't think he ever really loved me.

135
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,932
The real me, you know.

136
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,478
It hurts, not being
accepted for who you are.

137
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:55,563
I...

138
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:56,891
I would imagine.

139
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,446
You know, I've been in heaven
longer than any other human

140
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:06,409
and, let me tell you.
Paradise can get a little...

141
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,201
predictable.

142
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,621
Preaching to the choir.

143
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:15,309
So I started meeting

144
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,753
every new soul that was coming
through those Pearly Gates,

145
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:22,423
just taking in all their
incredible stories, you know,

146
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:25,217
about everything that
was going on down here.

147
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:26,220
And then...

148
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:29,474
Then I realized something huge, Luce.

149
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:33,311
What I truly desire most...

150
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:36,687
can only be found down here.

151
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,900
And what is it you truly desire?

152
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,030
Excitement! You know?

153
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,949
Thrills. Just some
good, old-fashioned fun.

154
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,995
I'm due a lifetime or two of it.

155
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:55,623
So you're telling me
you came all this way...

156
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,890
just to party?

157
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,603
And... you know...

158
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,715
see my ex.

159
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:13,516
I mean you are, after all, the
only person I know down here.

160
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:15,768
So do you have anywhere to stay?

161
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,297
Mm.

162
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,648
I...

163
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,148
haven't even thought about that yet.

164
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:22,976
Well, I can help you out.

165
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,903
Really?

166
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:29,448
Oh, my God. That would
be so sweet of you.

167
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,699
I wouldn't want to impose.

168
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:34,497
I know Pierre at the Waldorf. He owes
me a favor, so we'll get you a suite.

169
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:36,899
A hotel.

170
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:39,922
Great.

171
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:44,880
I'm sorry I'm not up for more tonight.

172
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:48,134
Yeah. Where did my fun Luce go?

173
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,677
I'm still fun.

174
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,721
You just caught me
at a bad time, is all.

175
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:54,449
I get it.

176
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:58,496
Can't expect the devil to suddenly
make his life all about Eve.

177
00:09:00,314 --> 00:09:01,691
This must be you.

178
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:06,863
Thank you.

179
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,151
For everything.

180
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:12,952
Anything for a...

181
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:15,163
an old friend.

182
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:19,000
Right, get her home safely, alright...

183
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,791
Hold on.

184
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,085
You're not Rafael with five stars.

185
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:24,920
The necklace. Now!

186
00:09:24,922 --> 00:09:26,464
I am canceling this ride.

187
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,383
Tell me where the necklace is or
I'll shoot your friend in the face.

188
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:31,469
There's no need to be so rude.

189
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,846
Lucifer! Oh, my God!

190
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,474
Help!

191
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,017
Oh, my God. Help!

192
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:42,938
Oh, my...

193
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,440
You're okay?

194
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:47,151
Well, I may need another drink
and a bottle of ibuprofen,

195
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,777
but, yes, I'll survive.

196
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,404
Oh, my God.

197
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:54,660
But I would love an
explanation from you, Eve.

198
00:09:56,966 --> 00:10:02,771

199
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,630
So...

200
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,007
Who the hell was that, mm?

201
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,344
It's not every day I get shot
in the face over some necklace.

202
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,641
I have no idea who
that scary driver was.

203
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,748
The only necklace I can think of is...

204
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:20,851
Pablo's.

205
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,561
And Pablo is?

206
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,899
The guy who gave me a
ride here on his jet.

207
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,631
On the way over, he kept showing off

208
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:30,152
this really expensive necklace he made.

209
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:34,657
Said it was for some Arab
guy with a weird name.

210
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:36,061
Byron?

211
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,061
Buster?

212
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:39,411
Doesn't sound very Arab.

213
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:40,412
Bashir?

214
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:42,873
Not Bashir Al-Fassad?

215
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,167
Yes, that's it! You know him?

216
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:48,214
Yes. He calls himself
the concierge of crime.

217
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:51,131
If Bashir thinks you've
taken something from him,

218
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,175
then he'll stop at
nothing to get it back.

219
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:55,052
But I don't have his necklace.

220
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,264
Well, then I suppose we
should pay Bashir a visit,

221
00:10:58,266 --> 00:10:59,809
sort this whole mess out, yes?

222
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,272
And how have we been feeling?

223
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:10,025
Great actually. Tons of
energy, sleeping well.

224
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:13,990
Not to mention I have a truly
supernatural support team.

225
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:20,369
Okay, ready to see your baby...

226
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:23,414
Maze! Maze.

227
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,252
It's just ultrasound gel.

228
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:33,675
- Continue.
- Good.

229
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,223
It's okay.

230
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:44,353
Okay.

231
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:49,900
Okay, do you see that little
protrusion right there?

232
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:52,026
You're having a boy.

233
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,440
A boy?

234
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:54,947
Better luck next time.

235
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,785
Do you see a second protrusion
anywhere? Maybe even a third?

236
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:03,120
Typically, there's only one penis.

237
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,333
Nah. I was looking for the wings.

238
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:07,666
The wings?

239
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:10,711
You know what?

240
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,272
I guess, at some point,

241
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,757
we all like to think of
our babies as little angels.

242
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,841
Oh, yes!

243
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:18,888
Wait, wings?

244
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,099
See? Isn't this nice?

245
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:27,561
Just a couple of sensible,
law-abiding detectives on a case.

246
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:30,773
No hidden flasks, no random drug use.

247
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:32,234
No crazy shenanigans.

248
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,072
You don't have to convince me
that life's better without Lucifer.

249
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:42,409
Detectives.

250
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,184
Welcome.

251
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:45,621
Can I get you a mojito?

252
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:47,956
Pete, get the detectives a mojito.

253
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,542
No, we're not here to
drink, Mr. Al-Fassad.

254
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:52,044
We're here about Pablo Silva.

255
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,128
Mm.

256
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,798
I'm afraid you're out of
luck. We don't know any Pablo.

257
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,051
So you didn't go to Mr. Silva's
hangar and strangle him to death?

258
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:00,260
Pablo's dead?

259
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,462
He was alive when we left him.

260
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:04,390
Oh, and when was that?

261
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:05,932
Um...

262
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:07,685
A long time ago.

263
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,187
So, you see, it appears
we cannot help you.

264
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,480
So very sorry.

265
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:14,985
Well, if you can't help us,
then maybe Turkish Pete here can.

266
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:18,290
Maybe a DNA test on these shells
will place you at the crime scene.

267
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:19,363
Dan.

268
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,564
- Hmm?
- Dan.

269
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:26,345
I wanted you here because
you're not like Lucifer, okay?

270
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,874
- So can you please relax?
- Did you say, "Lucifer"?

271
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,418
- Lucifer Morningstar?
- Uh-huh.

272
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:34,001
I love that guy.

273
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:36,797
Are you that partner of his
he's always gushing about?

274
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,007
Er... yeah.

275
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,470
Fabulous.

276
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:44,471
So, where is he?

277
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,900
Erm. He's home.

278
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,019
Sick.

279
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,400
Erm, as I recall, don't
you owe him a favor?

280
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:56,692
He told you about that, did he?

281
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:58,193
Yeah, he did.

282
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:00,464
And you're in luck, because
he said I could collect

283
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,030
on your debt in his absence.

284
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:04,825
You know, square you away for good.

285
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:05,951
Well..

286
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:07,637
As Lucifer would say...

287
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,165
what is it you desire?

288
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:11,373
The truth.

289
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,791
Alright then.

290
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:14,126
Yes.

291
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:15,801
I know Pablo.

292
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:20,340
I, shall we say, connect him
with the things that he desires.

293
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:23,471
Exotic women, exotic drugs etc., etc.

294
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:25,971
He racked up quite a tab.

295
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:27,347
But we worked out a deal.

296
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:30,476
Debt forgiven in exchange for a
one-of-a-kind piece of jewelry.

297
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:32,060
- The Desert Mirage.
- Bingo.

298
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:34,772
But Pablo managed to lose it before
we had a chance to get it back.

299
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:35,856
So you killed him.

300
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,816
This guy.

301
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:40,569
Why would I kill a man who
owes me millions? No, no.

302
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:43,697
We roughed him up a bit, told him
he'd better find it before we did

303
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:46,200
and then we left him in
the hangar. Very much alive.

304
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:48,452
Mm-hmm. Do you have
an alibi for all that?

305
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,415
We made a long stop at the
grocery store on the way home.

306
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:53,767
Refilled my pistachios.

307
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,960
I'm sure the store's security
cameras can verify that.

308
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,762
Oh, there's something
else I want to show you.

309
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:01,592
To prove my claim on the necklace.

310
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:06,099
Pablo sent this on the way over.

311
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,432
Bashir!

312
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:15,231
Hey, bud. Be there in no time.
Your necklace is in safe hands.

313
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,147
Hers!

314
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,786
Who are these women?

315
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:22,069
Don't know. But find them and
you'll probably find my necklace.

316
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,738
- And Pablo's killer.
- Mm!

317
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,157
Feels good to finally repay Lucifer.

318
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,994
Good thing you two are partners, huh?

319
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,495
This is so exciting!

320
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,207
Oh, wow. You against
a dangerous crime lord.

321
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,583
What are you going to do to him?

322
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:38,520
Ooh, are you going to
toss him in the pool?

323
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,587
No, are you going to break his arm?

324
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:42,506
Or, you know, bash him in the balls?

325
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,007
Ah, I always wanted to try that.

326
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,610
No-one will be bashing
anyone in the balls.

327
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,177
A simple conversation will suffice.

328
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,222
I never thought I would say this,
but Lucifer actually came in handy.

329
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:52,391
What are we doing? Not
that I'm complaining.

330
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:53,308
Shh.

331
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,602
There's no way you knew
Bashir owed Lucifer a favor.

332
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:56,728
Who are those two?

333
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,063
A total gamble.

334
00:15:58,065 --> 00:15:59,147
The police.

335
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,318
And I would prefer to avoid
her... them... at any cost.

336
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:11,742
Lucifer! So good to see you.

337
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:14,121
You just missed the lovely detective.

338
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:15,706
She said you were home sick.

339
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,624
Yes, well, I'm up and about now.

340
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,086
What, may I ask, was she here for?

341
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:24,018
Enquiring about the murder of a
client of mine. RIP, Pablo Silva.

342
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:25,591
Can I get you a mojito?

343
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:27,384
You didn't mention
this man was murdered.

344
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,053
- Did you have anything to do with this?
- Of course not.

345
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,267
This is the first I'm
hearing of this. Poor Pablo.

346
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:36,353
Uncle, I added more mint this time.

347
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:38,802
What the...

348
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,147
I shot you in the face!

349
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,107
Yes, and I gave you a terrible rating.

350
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:44,234
George! What have I told you?

351
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,278
No more shooting without my permission.

352
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I was trying to get your necklace back.

353
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:49,364
And this lady was...

354
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,076
Wait a second.

355
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,577
You're that woman from the plane.

356
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,330
- That's why we're here, Bashir.
- Yes.

357
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:57,539
I don't have your necklace.

358
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,792
So how about you leave her be and
we'll consider your debt to me paid.

359
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:02,878
A little too late, my friend.

360
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,966
Your partner collected your
favor in exchange for some info.

361
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,261
Clever detective.

362
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:11,827
Fine.

363
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,913
Partner?

364
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,582
Why not have a new arrangement?

365
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,807
How about I just pay
you for the necklace?

366
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,060
Sorry, but no.

367
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:19,186
I don't want money.

368
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:22,898
I want the Desert Mirage. It was
supposed to be a gift for my wife.

369
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,567
Mira, she will accept no substitutes.

370
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,154
The things we do for our women, right?

371
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,948
What? Her? No, no. We're
not together together.

372
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,366
But we used to be.

373
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:35,249
Maybe you've read about it in
a little book called The Bible.

374
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:36,251
Read about what?

375
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,622
You know, the garden,
the snake, the apple.

376
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,207
The metaphors were a bit off.

377
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:42,352
That's true. The forbidden
fruit was less of an apple

378
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,002
and more like a banana.

379
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:47,464
- A very large banana.
- It's true.

380
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,186
You never forget your first.

381
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:54,718
I have no idea what you
two are talking about.

382
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,100
Right. No, of course. Er, ooh!

383
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:01,353
Erm, look, why don't we
just strike a new deal?

384
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:04,982
You and your goons agree to leave
this young lady alone, unharmed,

385
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,733
whilst I attempt to
retrieve your necklace?

386
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:07,858
Deal.

387
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:09,945
Less work for me anyway.

388
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:12,864
Excellent. Once it's back in your hands,

389
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:15,285
we'll call it even and everyone
can go their separate ways.

390
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:31,626
Can you believe it?

391
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:33,055
A son.

392
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:36,598
There's so many things I
can't wait to teach him.

393
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:39,766
I mean, how to fight, obviously.

394
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:41,101
How to fly.

395
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,774
My very own mini Amenadiel.
No, no, wait, wait.

396
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:47,735
A-mini-diel.

397
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:50,694
Baby warrior angel. Ha!

398
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,239
Linda?

399
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,290
Nope.

400
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:00,454
- Nope, can't do it.
- Do what?

401
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:04,958
My house is not prepared
for a flying baby.

402
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,506
Other parents put up baby gates
and cover up power outlets.

403
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,090
What are we supposed to do?

404
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,717
Baby proof the ceiling?

405
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,093
You know, that's a good idea.

406
00:19:15,095 --> 00:19:16,928
Amenadiel, how are we
supposed to do this?

407
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,929
How are we supposed to
keep an angel baby safe?

408
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:22,558
I don't know. I've never seen
one before. No-one has.

409
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,643
You're joking.

410
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,604
You see, angels, we didn't grow up.

411
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:27,522
We just appeared fully formed.

412
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:29,566
That's how Mom and Dad created us.

413
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,569
So what you're telling me is
that what's happening to me,

414
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:36,247
what's growing inside my body...

415
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,659
is a first...

416
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:40,911
in all of human history?

417
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,207
All of angel history, too.

418
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,082
Isn't this exciting?

419
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:45,999
No!

420
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:48,703
No, it's not exciting, Amenadiel.

421
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:50,086
It's terrifying.

422
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,005
Linda, it's going to be okay.

423
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,174
I'll come over anytime
that you need help.

424
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:55,133
I appreciate that,

425
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:58,303
but how can you say everything's
going to be fine when...

426
00:19:58,305 --> 00:20:00,432
none of us know what to expect?

427
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,356
So do you have any
idea where it could be?

428
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:12,662
You seem extremely motivated
to find this necklace.

429
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:15,545
Does this have anything
to do with your...

430
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,531
- partner?
- No.

431
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,873
And former partner, just to be clear.

432
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:23,210
You know, you really don't
have to do this for me.

433
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:25,791
Nonsense. I'd never hang you out to dry.

434
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,294
Not with dangerous men
like Bashir after you.

435
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,590
So, uh, necklace...

436
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,095
Was there anyone else on Pablo's
jet? Anyone who could have stolen it?

437
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,180
There was actually.

438
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:45,142
A real party girl
named Odessa something.

439
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,685
What do you know about her?

440
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:47,936
Not much.

441
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:51,812
She seemed to really
enjoy giggling and, uh,

442
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:53,819
flirting and...

443
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,042
come to think of it...

444
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:59,074
trying on expensive jewelry.

445
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:02,909
She said she had this
friend named Dalton.

446
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,453
She kept mentioning
spending time at his place.

447
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:06,707
Dalton's Place?

448
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:09,209
That's not her friend. That's a bar.

449
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,712
It's a good place to start.

450
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,173
Come on!

451
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:19,615
Hey, so facial recognition kicked back

452
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:21,595
zilch on the one with the white dress,

453
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:25,098
but the woman modeling
the necklace, tons of hits.

454
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,016
- Tons?
- Yeah.

455
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,827
Necklace woman is a con artist.

456
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,979
Usually goes by Odessa
something or other.

457
00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:33,025
Her real name is Sandy Bumford.
No wonder she changes it.

458
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:35,858
Her MO is targeting guys in
bars, going back to their place

459
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,153
and cleaning them out before
they can offer her breakfast.

460
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:41,823
Here is a list of Odessa's
known hunting grounds in LA.

461
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:44,576
A bunch of high-end spots,
some dives, a few airport bars.

462
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:46,703
This lady gets around. How
the hell can we find her?

463
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,253
We're going to have to canvas each and

464
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:50,332
every one of these places one by one.

465
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:56,924
Nice horseshoe ring on
that sexy finger of yours.

466
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:58,798
Real gold?

467
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,342
Want to bite it to see?

468
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,429
I trust you.

469
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:05,891
Want to get us some drinks?

470
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,573
Looking to add to your collection?

471
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:15,898
Howdy, stranger.

472
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,097
Howdy.

473
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:19,486
Oh, hey, it's you.

474
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:20,904
What are you doing here?

475
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,156
We are here for the necklace.

476
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:26,159
So hand it over and we'll let you
get back to conning this poor schmuck.

477
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:27,244
Necklace? What necklace?

478
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:29,164
The one you're hiding...

479
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,124
in there.

480
00:22:36,213 --> 00:22:40,215
I see. You've paid off security to
help assist you with your little scam.

481
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:41,466
Quite the entrepreneur.

482
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:43,426
Tell me we're about to
have my first bar fight.

483
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,929
I could get things started
with the ball bashing.

484
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,764
Again, not necessary.

485
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,936
Or maybe it is.

486
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:57,597
Hey!

487
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,151
Let go!

488
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:01,069
Ow!

489
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:02,239
Ah!

490
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:09,621
Milady.

491
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:53,498
Oh!

492
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:17,564
Hiyah!

493
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:23,466
Lucifer!

494
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:33,455
Hello, detective.

495
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,417
Didn't know you were here.

496
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:41,669
I got a call about a bar fight.

497
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:43,548
It happens to be connected
to my latest case.

498
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:46,383
Want to tell me why you're here?

499
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,472
Not particularly.

500
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:54,309
I doubt you'd be able to accept it.

501
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:57,020
Lucifer...

502
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:06,737
Hey, Chloe.

503
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,987
Guess who I found?

504
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:09,616
Great.

505
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:18,708
Lucifer!

506
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:22,170
- Are you okay?
- I will be.

507
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:24,838
No...

508
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,964
I mean...

509
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:28,468
I saw what happened back
there with the detective.

510
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:31,370
You weren't just work
partners, were you?

511
00:25:31,373 --> 00:25:33,179
It doesn't matter. It's over.

512
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:34,224
Well...

513
00:25:35,642 --> 00:25:39,016
how come that pool stick hurt you,
but the bullet to the head didn't?

514
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:40,272
I...

515
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:43,690
Look, I will explain later,

516
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:45,986
but for now, we just
need to get out of here.

517
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,446
Come up with a new plan to
find that bloody necklace.

518
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:53,116
Lucifer Morningstar.

519
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,286
How do you know him and how is
he involved in Pablo's murder?

520
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,246
The sexy British guy in the suit?

521
00:25:58,248 --> 00:25:59,789
Never seen him before in my life.

522
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:03,793
Let's just talk about how you're
involved with Pablo's murder, okay?

523
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,796
I had nothing to do with that.
I'm a grifter, not a murderer.

524
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,924
I worked my way onto Pablo's
jet to steal the necklace.

525
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:13,303
- When I left, Pablo was alive.
- Where's the necklace now?

526
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,847
I gave it to the person
who hired me to steal it.

527
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,223
An independent broker.

528
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:18,641
- Who?
- No idea.

529
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:24,399
But if you agree to give me immunity
for liberating that necklace...

530
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,527
I can tell you where to find them.

531
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:29,736
It's fine with me.

532
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:32,197
Alright then. Downtown tomorrow night.

533
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,240
There's a black market jewelry auction,

534
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:36,826
exclusively for the rich and shady.

535
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,162
That's where they're planning
on reselling the necklace

536
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,057
Now that it's Pablo's last work,

537
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,157
I bet the necklace will
go for twice as much.

538
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:46,586
The broker realized he could double
his payday if he killed Pablo.

539
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:48,713
Money. It's always a
solid motive for murder.

540
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:50,425
Right. Find the broker, find the killer.

541
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,019
Maze, hi.

542
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,290
Hey.

543
00:27:07,457 --> 00:27:09,368
Have we been avoiding each other?

544
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,697
Yeah. I guess we have been.

545
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:17,200
I've just been trying to give you,
you know, space, as Linda suggested.

546
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:21,287
Trying to be understanding of the
fact that you are a backstabbing liar

547
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:23,266
who's been secretly
plotting against Lucifer

548
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,333
and keeping me away from Trixie.

549
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,585
You know what, you're right.

550
00:27:27,587 --> 00:27:30,046
But, Maze, for a second,

551
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,633
can you at least try to understand
what I've been going through?

552
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,761
To be the only human that knows.

553
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:37,679
Who knows what?

554
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:39,724
That heaven and hell...

555
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:42,618
truly exist.

556
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,519
I get it.

557
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:46,938
You're weak.

558
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,275
You can't handle this.

559
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,069
Maybe I should just move out.

560
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:01,825
By the way...

561
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:04,249
you're not the only human who knows.

562
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,335
Linda handled it much better than you.

563
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:13,423
You've known this whole time?

564
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,052
Well, not the whole time, but...

565
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,221
for quite a while, yes.

566
00:28:19,222 --> 00:28:21,558
I just wish I'd have
known that you knew.

567
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:24,976
I don't know how to
deal with this, Linda.

568
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:26,479
When I found out...

569
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,314
what Lucifer was...

570
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:30,650
who he truly was...

571
00:28:32,152 --> 00:28:34,569
I ran away for a month.

572
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:38,309
An understandable
reaction in the situation.

573
00:28:38,312 --> 00:28:40,076
Have you seen his...

574
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,869
face when it...

575
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,370
It was...

576
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:45,999
It was quite alarming.

577
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,335
Yeah. Yeah.

578
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:53,590
And, Maze, how is it being friends
with her, knowing what she is?

579
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:55,840
Well...

580
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:57,594
it wasn't easy.

581
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:00,428
None of it is.

582
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,641
The devil, a demon...

583
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:06,559
Dating an angel. Having his baby.

584
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:07,810
Right.

585
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,187
Wait, what? You're pregnant?

586
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:10,438
Yeah.

587
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:12,429
With an...

588
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:14,694
angel baby.

589
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:18,710
Ha!

590
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,327
Truth be told I'm freaking out,
Chloe. I mean, it's all just...

591
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,329
It's all just hitting me...

592
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,917
all at once, you know,
just how dangerous...

593
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,043
How dangerous my friends are

594
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:33,378
and how...

595
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,134
How dangerous this baby
inside me might be. I mean...

596
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:42,011
There's a good chance it
could come out with wings.

597
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,137
Wings!

598
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:45,640
Is that even safe for
a human to deliver?

599
00:29:45,642 --> 00:29:47,076
Should I have a C-section?

600
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,477
Will insurance cover any
of this? I mean, who knows?

601
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,645
Who knows, Chlo?

602
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:53,439
Okay. Linda? Linda.

603
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:56,442
If anyone can handle this...

604
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:57,568
it's you.

605
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,864
You're different than
me. You're stronger.

606
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:02,659
You could have run, but you didn't.

607
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,703
Why didn't you?

608
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,458
I don't know. I guess...

609
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:14,295
with all the bad...

610
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,467
comes a lot of good.

611
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:24,723
I got a best friend out of this.

612
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:28,850
And the...

613
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:31,563
most fascinating patient in the world.

614
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:35,900
And this baby.

615
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:39,988
Who saw that coming?

616
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:42,949
I guess, as freaked out as I am...

617
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:46,369
I'm really looking
forward to being a mom.

618
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,165
And meeting my son.

619
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,170
Wings and all.

620
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,548
So how about Lucifer?

621
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,768
It's, it's...

622
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,554
It's complicated.

623
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:10,682
I mean, I guess what it really
all comes down to is one...

624
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,187
simple question.

625
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:15,315
Do you want him in your life or not?

626
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,363
Hello.

627
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,249
I think I might be able to help you...

628
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:36,800
with your case.

629
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,167
So you're the other woman
from Pablo's private jet?

630
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,382
That's me.

631
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:45,051
We had a hard time IDing you.

632
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:46,469
Oh, I'm not from around here.

633
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,889
So let's start with... do
you know who killed Pablo?

634
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:53,186
You know, I heard someone
mention the name Bashir Al-Fassad.

635
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,019
Does that help?

636
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:56,689
Not so much.

637
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:03,154
Do you know of anyone who
would want to hurt Pablo?

638
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:08,615
No, I really only just
met him at the airport bar,

639
00:32:08,618 --> 00:32:12,784
right before he invited me and
that other girl onto his jet, sorry.

640
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:14,082
Okay.

641
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:19,087
You know, you seem really
smart and very kind.

642
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:23,132
I can see how someone
would be drawn to you.

643
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:26,090
Thank you.

644
00:32:28,054 --> 00:32:29,639
You also seem a little sad.

645
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:32,639
Excuse me?

646
00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:34,435
Don't worry.

647
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,979
There's someone out there for everyone.

648
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:39,230
What?

649
00:32:39,232 --> 00:32:41,693
Okay. Yeah, I think we're done here.

650
00:32:46,823 --> 00:32:48,739
I just had the weirdest interview.

651
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:51,951
- No. Nothing. I didn't do anything.
- I'm sorry, what?

652
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:53,366
Never mind.

653
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:55,248
Why do you have two mugs?

654
00:32:58,334 --> 00:32:59,833
Oh...

655
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:01,836
You know me. Gotta Java.

656
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,588
This smells like whiskey.

657
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,466
What? Chloe, that is not mine.

658
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:08,759
I would never, ever drink on the job.

659
00:33:08,762 --> 00:33:10,401
I know.

660
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:12,073
That's Lucifer's, isn't it?

661
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:14,976
I'm so sorry. Chloe, he...

662
00:33:15,852 --> 00:33:18,227
He brought me a caramel triple frappe

663
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,730
with extra whipped cream
and rainbow sprinkles.

664
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,372
Ella, it's fine.

665
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,529
As long as you didn't tell him about
our plans for the auction tonight.

666
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,206
Starting...

667
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:41,083
at 300,000.

668
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,477
We need to grab the necklace

669
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,872
and disappear before
the detective arrives.

670
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:48,841
Four-five.

671
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:51,010
Can I get 500?

672
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:52,013
There it is.

673
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:54,186
Right.

674
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:55,765
You distract the guard.

675
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,421
I'll smash the glass, then
we'll make a break for it.

676
00:33:58,424 --> 00:33:59,938
Sounds risky.

677
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:02,355
I like it.

678
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:03,564
Ah!

679
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:05,775
Bugger. Well, there goes our plan.

680
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,570
I think he's taking
the necklace backstage.

681
00:34:09,572 --> 00:34:11,491
You know, to put on one of the models.

682
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,410
I think you might be right.

683
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:16,979
Wait here.

684
00:34:16,982 --> 00:34:18,393
I've got this.

685
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:25,544
Hello there, I'm Lucifer.

686
00:34:25,547 --> 00:34:27,171
- Lucifer Morning...
- Yes.

687
00:34:27,174 --> 00:34:28,466
Yes to what?

688
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,174
Anything.

689
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:34,815
Still got it.

690
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,642
How did it go?

691
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,310
Oh! You got it!

692
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,561
You're incredible.

693
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:43,729
Please, I'm the devil.

694
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:45,147
Yes, you are.

695
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,360
Ah. Well done, partner.

696
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:49,485
Mm. Cheers.

697
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:54,701
Let's get out of here.

698
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:57,370
Detective.

699
00:34:58,457 --> 00:35:00,874
Afraid you're a bit late.
You've missed all the fun.

700
00:35:00,877 --> 00:35:02,163
I am not here for fun.

701
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,917
- I am here to solve a murder.
- Hello again, detective.

702
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,210
Please don't call me that.

703
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:08,087
Care to explain how
you two know each other?

704
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:10,049
Yes. She's my date and we're leaving.

705
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:13,676
I need that necklace to
flush out Pablo's killer.

706
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,304
And what makes you think I care?

707
00:35:19,142 --> 00:35:20,307
Well...

708
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:21,644
despite our...

709
00:35:23,146 --> 00:35:24,990
issues...

710
00:35:24,993 --> 00:35:27,230
I think you still do.

711
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:31,235
So if you have it, I
could really use your help.

712
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:33,487
If we help you, you'll let
us leave with the necklace.

713
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:36,323
- You know I can't promise that.
- Oh, can't you?

714
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:39,326
Come on, Luce. Where
else do we have to be?

715
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:40,943
It'll be fun.

716
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:45,750
Oh, bloody hell.

717
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:50,629
Ladies and gentlemen, item number 45005.

718
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:53,466
Pablo Silva's Desert Mirage.

719
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:55,386
Starting bid, one million.

720
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:02,808
One million.

721
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,228
Can I get one five?

722
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,814
One five. How about two?

723
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:10,860
Two five?

724
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,958
Three?

725
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,021
Three five?

726
00:36:22,504 --> 00:36:23,713
Four?

727
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,375
Four!

728
00:36:28,377 --> 00:36:30,669
For crying out loud. 10 million!

729
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:34,627
Going once, going twice.

730
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,594
Sold for 10 million to the
dapper gentleman in the back.

731
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,179
Stop it.

732
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:47,063
Champagne.

733
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,201
Can't celebrate without my bubbles.

734
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:53,372
Sir, the winning bidder's here.

735
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:57,302
Turkish Pete?

736
00:36:57,305 --> 00:37:00,407
Why am I going to all this trouble
trying to find your boss's necklace

737
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:02,408
when you had it all along?

738
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:04,954
I love working for Mr. Al-Fassad...

739
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,705
but the Desert Mirage is worth millions

740
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:08,040
he'll just give it to his wife.

741
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:10,102
So you Odessa to steal it from Pablo

742
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,002
while you and Bashir
went to beat him up?

743
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:13,129
You could sell it here.

744
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,171
You fool.

745
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:15,649
Not only do you not get the money,

746
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,842
but now you're going to
jail for Pablo's murder.

747
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,458
- Actually, he's not.
- He's not?

748
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:20,845
No, Pete's alibi checks out.

749
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:22,263
The grocery store security footage

750
00:37:22,265 --> 00:37:24,723
shows him there during
the time of Pablo's death.

751
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:25,747
He's not the killer.

752
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,394
Course not, I would never kill
Pablo. He was our cash cow.

753
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:30,855
Always in debt, always
getting bailed out.

754
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:31,885
Bailed out by who?

755
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:32,982
His business partner, Toby.

756
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:36,068
Toby said he had no idea that
Pablo was into any trouble.

757
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,302
Oh, well, imagine that.
You've been lied to.

758
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:57,089
Dan, I got the seller,
but he's not the killer.

759
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,675
Have the team get ready to
take this place down anyhow.

760
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,678
Copy that.

761
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,096
You know who the killer is though,
don't you? Is it this Toby fellow?

762
00:38:04,098 --> 00:38:06,015
- I thought you didn't care.
- I don't.

763
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,099
Just checking your logic,

764
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:09,518
since you've probably made
a lot of mistakes without me.

765
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,607
Well, contrary to what you
think, I don't need your help.

766
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,946
Lucifer, help!

767
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:18,027
Eve?

768
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,322
Hand me the necklace.

769
00:38:21,657 --> 00:38:23,324
Drop the weapon.

770
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:24,825
Toby, let her go.

771
00:38:24,827 --> 00:38:26,162
Back off! Back off.

772
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:30,251
I am walking out of here with
this necklace. It belongs to me.

773
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:33,124
Toby, I know everything
and I understand.

774
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:34,752
You understand? What do you understand?

775
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:36,837
That I spent our entire
budget on this necklace?

776
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:40,257
That I'm ruined without it? That I
only snuck in here to get what's mine?

777
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:42,553
No. I understand you.

778
00:38:43,304 --> 00:38:44,388
The reasonable one.

779
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:46,899
The one always taking
care of their partner.

780
00:38:47,683 --> 00:38:48,976
Cleaning up his messes.

781
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:51,562
Everybody loves Pablo.

782
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:53,520
The fun one.

783
00:38:53,522 --> 00:38:55,481
But if they knew who he really was...

784
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:56,649
He was a train wreck.

785
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:59,860
He wasted all our money
on hookers and blow.

786
00:38:59,862 --> 00:39:02,279
That doesn't sound like
such a bad guy to me.

787
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:04,116
And after that voice mail...

788
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:09,163
I rushed down there, found him
beaten up, the Mirage gone. I just...

789
00:39:09,871 --> 00:39:11,079
I got so angry.

790
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,960
Drop the gun and let her go.

791
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,417
Eve...

792
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,710
you know that thing
you've always wanted to do?

793
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:26,472
Turn over. Hands behind your back.

794
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:29,473
- Oh, my...
- Are you alright?

795
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:31,141
Yes. Did you see that?

796
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:32,643
I did. You nailed it.

797
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:37,230
Daniel...

798
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:39,663
I'd like that necklace,
thank you very much.

799
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:43,489
What? Do you really think we would
just hand you stolen evidence?

800
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:46,033
Turn over.

801
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,530
Detective.

802
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,169
We need that necklace.

803
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:03,175
Ah, I'm sorry, Lucifer.
I wish I could help you.

804
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:06,698
Come on.

805
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:19,827
See?

806
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,143
We've got this.

807
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:23,986
We do, don't we?

808
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:24,989
Mm-hmm.

809
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:29,908
Bring it, angel baby.

810
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:39,001
This some weird fetish
I don't know about?

811
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,088
Maze, hi. What are you doing here?

812
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,213
Erm...

813
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,590
well, I decided to...

814
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:48,949
end Chloe's misery.

815
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,272
I'm moving out.

816
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:53,476
Going somewhere where I'm wanted.

817
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,729
Somewhere like here.

818
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,955
Oh.

819
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:03,859
Wow.

820
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,666
Yeah, you know...

821
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:08,739
Linda's not really
prepared for a house guest.

822
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:11,160
This is happening, okay? Deal with it.

823
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,579
Auntie Maze is here to help with
the baby, whether you like it or not.

824
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,327
Auntie Maze.

825
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,667
I love it.

826
00:41:19,335 --> 00:41:21,543
We can use all the help we can get.

827
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,170
Good. It's settled.

828
00:41:23,172 --> 00:41:25,506
Now, where do I put my knives?

829
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:36,227
So... if I can just get you to sign
my final paperwork of the night.

830
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,316
The silent treatment.

831
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:44,566
I get it.

832
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,527
I shouldn't have told
Lucifer that stuff.

833
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:48,823
It was really unprofessional
and I'm so sorry.

834
00:41:49,698 --> 00:41:50,950
Ella, I'm not mad at you.

835
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,702
I just... I've...

836
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:57,037
just been thinking about things.

837
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:58,040
Between you and Lucifer?

838
00:42:00,404 --> 00:42:01,779
Yeah.

839
00:42:01,836 --> 00:42:03,240
Yeah.

840
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:04,255
I miss him.

841
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:08,092
I mean, he pisses me off all the time.

842
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:12,179
And there are so many
things about him that...

843
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,722
that I find hard to accept,

844
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:17,977
but I just have to
believe I can find a way.

845
00:42:19,228 --> 00:42:20,540
Because...

846
00:42:22,231 --> 00:42:24,358
I'd rather have him in my life than not.

847
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:28,259
Well, then...

848
00:42:28,262 --> 00:42:30,779
I think you know what you need to do.

849
00:42:48,048 --> 00:42:49,715
I don't believe this.

850
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:51,427
We were cheated out of that necklace.

851
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:53,679
Well...

852
00:42:55,055 --> 00:43:00,767
on the bright side, now we can
break into the precinct and...

853
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:01,937
steal it right back.

854
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:05,149
Doesn't that sound like fun?

855
00:43:05,654 --> 00:43:06,987
Yes, it does, actually.

856
00:43:11,363 --> 00:43:13,532
I had a really nice
time with you tonight.

857
00:43:14,742 --> 00:43:16,593
As did I.

858
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:20,202
Setback aside, I think
that we should celebrate.

859
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:22,372
I'll get some champagne.

860
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:25,617
What's this?

861
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:33,677
I can explain that.

862
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,266
How long have you had this?

863
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:38,907
It dropped out of Toby's pocket

864
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,101
when you flipped him
and I just grabbed it.

865
00:43:41,104 --> 00:43:42,809
And you weren't going to tell me?

866
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:45,395
Of course I was. I just...

867
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:46,649
Maybe not right away.

868
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:49,650
- Why?
- Because...

869
00:43:49,652 --> 00:43:52,569
you made it very clear that
once we found the necklace,

870
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:54,406
we would go our separate ways and...

871
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,617
I didn't want the fun to end.

872
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,226
What else are you hiding from me?

873
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:01,577
Nothing.

874
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,937
You're lying.

875
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:08,546
Okay, everything I told you is true.

876
00:44:10,673 --> 00:44:15,135
Except for maybe one
little, teeny, tiny part.

877
00:44:17,596 --> 00:44:22,059
I did come back to Earth for
the fun and the excitement.

878
00:44:22,977 --> 00:44:24,979
But, more specifically...

879
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:27,976
I came back...

880
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:30,132
for you.

881
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:31,650
To be...

882
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:33,179
with you.

883
00:44:33,182 --> 00:44:34,874
You know?

884
00:44:34,877 --> 00:44:36,835
Like old times.

885
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:38,490
That was...

886
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:40,325
thousands of years ago.

887
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:44,039
Yes, but it was also
the best time of my life.

888
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:49,835
Lucifer, I never felt more like
myself than when I was with you.

889
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:51,088
Eve...

890
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:54,592
I'm sorry, if you've come
all this way for me...

891
00:44:56,135 --> 00:44:57,791
then...

892
00:44:57,794 --> 00:44:59,470
you've made a mistake.

893
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,767
Why?

894
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,768
It's because of her, isn't it?

895
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:07,643
No.

896
00:45:07,646 --> 00:45:09,189
I told you, that's over.

897
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,775
No.

898
00:45:13,652 --> 00:45:15,237
I mean your insecurity.

899
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,655
I'm not insecure.

900
00:45:18,657 --> 00:45:19,908
Now who's lying?

901
00:45:21,827 --> 00:45:23,553
I'm not blind.

902
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:26,795
I know what rejection looks like.

903
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:29,251
What it feels like.

904
00:45:31,491 --> 00:45:34,590
The detective doesn't accept
you for who you are, does she?

905
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:40,278
No.

906
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:41,559
She doesn't.

907
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,442
Well, I'm not her.

908
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:48,497
You don't know me, Eve.

909
00:45:51,106 --> 00:45:52,232
Who I truly am.

910
00:45:53,776 --> 00:45:54,963
Show me.

911
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:02,785
Very well.

912
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:06,822
You asked for it.

913
00:46:21,872 --> 00:46:23,514
I told you.

914
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,971
I think you're amazing.

915
00:46:33,932 --> 00:46:35,604
All of you.
