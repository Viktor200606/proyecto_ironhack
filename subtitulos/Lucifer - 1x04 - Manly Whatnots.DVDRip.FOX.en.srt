1
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:03,336
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:05,336
You're the Lord of Hell,
for crying out loud.

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:07,842
I'm retired, Maze. I've
got nothing but time.

4
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:08,986
How could you possibly help me?

5
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:12,296
I have the ability to draw
out people's forbidden desires.

6
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:13,729
I got it. The name,

7
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:14,793
the whole Lucifer thing,

8
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:16,062
and desire's like your superpower.

9
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:17,463
It's more like a gift from God, really.

10
00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:19,971
I saw Lucifer do some
things that I can't explain.

11
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:21,713
Is Lucifer a magician?

12
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:23,915
That's sort of what I'm
trying to figure out.

13
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,335
You were once the brightest
of all of God's angels.

14
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,287
And now, your time here on Earth

15
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,788
is affecting you, dear brother.

16
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,807
You're changing.

17
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:34,475
My life is change.

18
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,016
- What are you doing here?
- Ooh, how's your ex? Detective Douche?

19
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,325
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,236
I told you, I'm good at punishing people.

21
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:44,791
Nay, I'm the best at punishing bad people.

22
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:48,841
Yeah, well, I think you don't
just enjoy punishing the bad guys.

23
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:53,498
I think you're starting to like
seeking justice for the good ones.

24
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:41,270
He's the Devil!

25
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:43,388
<i>He's the Devil!</i>

26
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,566
Lucifer?

27
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:30,808
Well,

28
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:33,017
good morning, Detective.

29
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,478
What the hell are you doing here?

30
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:39,912
- Setting the table.
- You broke into my house?

31
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:41,531
Yes, well, I hope you don't
mind, but I made a little brekkie.

32
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,576
You were taking forever in the shower.

33
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:45,451
What do you do in there?

34
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:46,943
You are unbelievable!

35
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:50,008
Oh, thank you, but it's you
who should take the compliment.

36
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:52,509
Really kept things up since <i>Hot
Tub High School,</i> haven't we?

37
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,437
Ding-dong.

38
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:55,369
I want to shoot you.

39
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:56,761
Tease. Do it.

40
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:57,982
I'm immortal, remember?

41
00:02:58,017 --> 00:03:00,062
Uh, do you have any truffle oil?

42
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:02,354
Lucifer, get out of my house now.

43
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,182
- We haven't eaten yet.
- Out.

44
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,812
Well, don't we need to
discuss the next case?

45
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:07,689
There is no next case.

46
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:08,651
- What?
- Out.

47
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:10,296
We're already late, so let's go.

48
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:11,268
Lucifer!

49
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:12,835
Yeah.

50
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,281
What in God's name are you doing here?

51
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:16,280
Nothing in his name.
Here on my own, actually.

52
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:18,817
Did you and Mommy have a sleepover?

53
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:21,784
No. No. Absolutely not, no.

54
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,924
What are you guys doing here anyway?

55
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:25,928
She left her bird report here.

56
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:27,692
- Want to see?
- Um, not really.

57
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:29,916
Here, have a snack, child.

58
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,816
Are you sleeping with this idiot?

59
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,518
She hasn't had the
pleasure, unfortunately, no.

60
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,328
Okay, everybody out.
Trixie has to get to school.

61
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:41,669
I got to get to work. Come on, out, please.

62
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:44,411
No, no, no, no, no, you
can't throw me out again.

63
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,676
Again?

64
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:47,011
So this is a habit.

65
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:48,630
- Yes, shocking, isn't it?
- No.

66
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:50,498
Never been thrown out of
anywhere before in my life.

67
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,250
Well, except for Heaven, of course.

68
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,601
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

69
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,055
But somebody please flip the
omelet if it's not already ruined.

70
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,791
Hey, Dan, I'm...

71
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,526
Really, Chloe?

72
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:04,262
I'm disappointed in you.

73
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,476
Good. Right, you're here.

74
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:24,906
- Um, I need to chat.
- Lucifer, we don't have an appointment.

75
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:26,440
Something very disturbing's just happened.

76
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,006
It's horrific, really.

77
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,568
Uh, for the second time,

78
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,907
I've been thrown out of a woman's house.

79
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:33,725
- Okay, sorry, uh, Lu...
- I mean, I'm starting to wonder

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,946
if the detective has some
sort of biological dysfunction.

81
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,565
- Lucifer.
- 'Cause, I mean, I appeal

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,941
to the virile urge in all women.

83
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:41,688
Certainly, well, certainly you
can attest to that, can't you?

84
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:43,155
Uh, Lucifer, stop.

85
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,744
Yes, of course, sorry. Payment first.

86
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,505
Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No! No!

87
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,745
Hmm?

88
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,281
Lucifer, this is George.

89
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:54,894
George, Lucifer.

90
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:56,981
Lucifer, George.

91
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:01,385
Oops.

92
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:12,630
- Dan, if you're here to scold me...
- No.

93
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:15,422
I just got off the phone
with the lieutenant.

94
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:17,134
There's a case.

95
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,845
Day four.

96
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:22,813
Down to three meat sticks,
a half a bottle of water,

97
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:25,551
217 miles to L.A.

98
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,541
I'm not sure we're gonna make it,

99
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:31,030
'cause my brother drives
like a narcoleptic old lady.

100
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:33,117
Say hi, Grandma!

101
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,883
No, that's our only nourishment!

102
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,914
Her name's Lindsay Jolson.

103
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,405
Just turned 22.

104
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,818
She went missing catering
a Players' Club event.

105
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:43,957
Players' Club?

106
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:45,824
It's one of those skeezy
pickup artist groups.

107
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,166
You know, that teach
geeks how to be sex gods.

108
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,095
Got it.

109
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,969
Lindsay was last seen
talking to the lead scumbag.

110
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:56,073
The founder, Carver Cruz.

111
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,926
So he was interrogated?

112
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:00,232
Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.

113
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:01,752
And with no proof, we're stuck.

114
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:04,248
But there's a Players'
seminar and after-party today.

115
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:05,938
And you need to go undercover.

116
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,557
Why me? I'm homicide.

117
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:08,975
Because you're our best way in.

118
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,196
- I am?
- Apparently these events

119
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:12,219
are pretty exclusive, and
when I saw the guest list,

120
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:14,157
I recognized one of the names.

121
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:17,698
I guess a lot of high-end
club owners are invited.

122
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:19,426
Oh, come on.

123
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,032
No. You're kidding.

124
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,764
I wish I was.

125
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,777
- Lucifer's on the list?
- Yeah.

126
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,608
Yeah, of course he is.

127
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:30,483
Look...

128
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:33,669
the last thing I want is the guy I found

129
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,592
making my half-naked wife
breakfast this morning

130
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:37,082
spending more time with her,

131
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:38,883
separated or not.

132
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,284
But...

133
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,296
This is the best option.

134
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,113
I wouldn't ask, but I just keep thinking,

135
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:48,158
what if this was our daughter?

136
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:54,595
The detective seems
like a very lovely woman.

137
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,351
Well, I suppose, but still, she's human.

138
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:58,803
Why is she able to refuse my charms?

139
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:00,543
I mean, is this thing on?

140
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:03,012
Yes, yes.

141
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,855
Definitely on.

142
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:11,518
It's not that you're afraid that
you don't have power over Chloe.

143
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,187
It's that you're afraid
that she has power over you,

144
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:15,800
but neither one is true.

145
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,221
- No?
- No.

146
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,258
People don't have power over us.

147
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:22,326
We give it to them.

148
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:24,723
You have to take your power back.

149
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,046
Right, go on.

150
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,670
You say she's nothing special, but
I think you've put her on a pedestal.

151
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:33,004
You need to really get to know her,

152
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,341
warts and all.

153
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,331
I'm sure she has some.

154
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:42,788
So, demystify her

155
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:45,766
by bringing her back
down to your own level.

156
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:49,777
You're right.

157
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,591
It's not her, it's me.

158
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:53,683
I need to take back control.

159
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:55,723
I need to behave like I always have.

160
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,649
Good. So you understand.

161
00:07:57,713 --> 00:07:58,545
Yes.

162
00:07:58,589 --> 00:07:59,718
Yes.

163
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:02,520
I mean, it seems obvious now, actually.

164
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:04,415
I need to have sex with her.

165
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:07,249
Uh... no, uh, that's not what I said.

166
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,847
No, no, no, you're a genius. I mean,
that's the best way to lose interest, right?

167
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:12,668
Right. Good-o.

168
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,044
Hmm.

169
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,772
Thanks, love.

170
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,455
Oh, sure.

171
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,973
- Payment next time, okay?
- Uh...

172
00:08:19,617 --> 00:08:21,250
Um...

173
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,561
Her name's Lindsay Jolson.

174
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:31,295
Mm-hmm.

175
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,994
She's been missing almost three full days.

176
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:36,162
Right, so just ask me one more time.

177
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,887
Lucifer, there's a girl missing.

178
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:39,695
Yes, it's just not every day

179
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,282
someone kicks you out of your house,
then three hours later asks you on a date.

180
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:45,666
It's not a date. It's a work thing.

181
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:48,235
- Oh.
- And are you gonna help me or not?

182
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:49,975
All right.

183
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:53,351
But only 'cause it coincides
perfectly with my own plan.

184
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,019
And what plan is that?

185
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:57,321
Well, to have sex with you, of course.

186
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,079
Okay.

187
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:01,766
Wait, you and I... well,
there is no you and I.

188
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:03,473
There's a professional situation,

189
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,496
- and I just need you...
- See, you need me.

190
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:07,445
The department needs you,
because you're the one...

191
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,799
I'm the one?

192
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,717
On the list for the Player thing.

193
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,738
You're quite adorable
when you're flustered.

194
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:16,368
I... I'm not flustered.

195
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:17,199
I'm nauseous.

196
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,544
Now you're blushing; I'd
say I'm making headway.

197
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,428
Okay, look, let me make
myself perfectly clear.

198
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:26,217
I will never,

199
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:29,420
ever, ever sleep with you.

200
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,821
Never.

201
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:32,323
Okay? Got it?

202
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,158
Playing hard to get, I like it.

203
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:36,727
When Hell freezes over, Lucifer.

204
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:38,329
I can arrange that, actually.

205
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:40,368
Get in the car.

206
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:47,411
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

207
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:01,478
Well, hello.

208
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:07,217
Here you are, Mr. Morningstar.

209
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:08,787
Well, thank you, lovely.

210
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,112
And here's something else you might need.

211
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:15,410
Well, yes, that might come in handy.

212
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:17,261
Pardon the pun.

213
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:19,729
Whoa.

214
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:22,802
Did you just number close the nametag girl?

215
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,601
Oh.

216
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:27,567
Use this wisely. You're welcome.

217
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:32,529
I can't believe you.

218
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:35,324
Don't worry, Detective. I'm
more of a leg man myself.

219
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,673
Soon as you say the word,
you'll have your turn.

220
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:40,882
Wow, you've never been
rejected by a woman, have you?

221
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:42,187
No.

222
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,861
Get your hands off me!

223
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:45,479
I want to talk to Carver Cruz!

224
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,782
I need you to leave right now, sir.

225
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:48,950
Carver!

226
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,222
Carver, can you hear me?!

227
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:51,804
It's the missing girl's brother.

228
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,552
What'd you do to my sister?!

229
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,461
Get out here, you coward!

230
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,090
It's okay. I got this.

231
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,701
- I know him.
- No, you don't.

232
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:00,603
Look, I'm sorry. He has
to leave the premises.

233
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,473
Oh, I don't think that'll
be necessary, Officer.

234
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:05,625
Besides, isn't this quite boring?

235
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,213
I mean, there are several lovely
ladies milling around out there.

236
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,439
Which one do you desire?

237
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:15,110
You.

238
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:16,453
I'm gay.

239
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:17,514
Oh!

240
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,334
Right.

241
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:21,499
Well, my dance card's full
with this one, I'm afraid.

242
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:24,096
But the odds are definitely
in your favor out there.

243
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:27,030
Probably not batting for the
same team, but you never know...

244
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,418
So go on, then. Go forth and conquer.

245
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,842
I know you want to.

246
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:32,035
Yeah.

247
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,870
Right.

248
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:35,783
Off you pop.

249
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,083
You're Lindsay's brother.

250
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:37,990
How'd you know that?

251
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,450
Because she's a cop.

252
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:41,669
Great. Say that louder. I
don't think everyone heard you.

253
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:42,345
Right.

254
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,615
Sorry, yes, we're here undercover

255
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,017
to find out what happened to your sister.

256
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:49,752
If you can help me, I'll
tell you what happened.

257
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:50,920
Carver killed her.

258
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,771
Killed her? You sure about that?

259
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,024
No, but...

260
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:55,574
look, I know my sister.

261
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,794
She's a good person. She's sweet.

262
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:01,012
She wouldn't just run off.
She's not even from L.A.

263
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,595
I'm all she has out here.

264
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:05,481
She's all I have.

265
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,650
Kevin, I promise you,

266
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,325
if anyone here hurt your
sister, I'll find them.

267
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,650
And I'll punish them.

268
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:12,300
Any method you prefer.

269
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:15,130
Nice solid flogging. Get the ol'
swamp nuts in a vice, you know.

270
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,713
Okay. It's time to go now.

271
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:19,939
Let us handle this, and if we
hear anything, we'll be in touch.

272
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,355
Okay. Thank you.

273
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:22,269
Yeah.

274
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,873
We've got this.

275
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,162
You have to admit, we're quite a good team.

276
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:31,290
If you weren't so pent-up sexually,
we'd be firing on all cylinders, I'd say.

277
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:40,391
I'm assuming you learned most of
your moves at events like these.

278
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,291
I've never been to something
like this before in my life.

279
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:44,591
I certainly don't need any
help getting women into bed.

280
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:45,625
Till...

281
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:47,705
Were you hit on the
head when you were small?

282
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,193
No?

283
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,103
We are biological machines.

284
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:26,655
We... are warriors.

285
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,654
We... are players!

286
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,567
Gentlemen, we are animals.

287
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:42,892
Men are the wolves, and women...

288
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:45,969
...are the fluffy bunnies.

289
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:51,107
So we must prepare ourselves for the hunt.

290
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:51,919
How?

291
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:53,870
"Follow the list."

292
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:56,080
Yes! The C.K.C.

293
00:13:56,162 --> 00:13:58,807
The Conduct of Kick-ass Cavemen.

294
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:01,885
One: Be seen.

295
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:03,197
People pay for this?

296
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:04,665
Yeah, 5,000 bucks.

297
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,113
Stand out.

298
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:09,072
The peacock, the lion with his mane.

299
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:13,113
Two: Be a protector.

300
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:13,844
Duh.

301
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:16,995
Women are hardwired to hook up with someone

302
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,722
who can help them survive.

303
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,471
It is simple biology, man.

304
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:24,409
Three: Be brave.

305
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,470
Take risks.

306
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:27,076
Oh, maybe you should take notes.

307
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:30,493
Four: Be a leader of men.

308
00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:32,831
And the most elusive.

309
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:37,478
Five: Be confident.

310
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,849
You... are...

311
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,691
a player!

312
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:42,659
Own it!

313
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:46,437
Excuse-excuse me! Excuse me, question!

314
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:47,400
What are you doing?

315
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:48,991
The Q&A's after the speech, buddy.

316
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,667
No, but it's quite pressing.

317
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:54,852
What if you have all those manly whatnots
and a woman still doesn't respond?

318
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:58,054
You may think you have them, but you don't.

319
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,594
- Yeah.
- That's why you're here, right?

320
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,878
So, gentlemen, you follow these rules,

321
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:05,574
and you will bed any Betty
you desire, guaranteed.

322
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:08,818
No. No. No, no, no. I'm certain I've
got everything on your little list,

323
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:10,587
and more, actually,

324
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:14,347
yet this woman here won't have sex with me.

325
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:18,661
Just listen to the speech, buddy.

326
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:20,180
The system works.

327
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:21,919
No, but I doubt that.

328
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:24,411
Because... because if
I can't "bed a Betty,"

329
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:26,179
then how do you possibly expect

330
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:29,111
any of these poor miscreants to succeed?

331
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:33,792
Especially when they're taking
advice from a-a wanker such as you?

332
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,178
All right, just sit down, man.

333
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:36,538
Yeah, Lucifer, sit down.

334
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:39,182
I-I just... could we get
the spotlight over here?

335
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:40,352
Do we have that?

336
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:42,785
Yeah, yeah. But on-on her.

337
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:44,425
Good. Right.

338
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,821
Now, you're the expert.

339
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:47,458
You tell me what's wrong with this picture.

340
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,512
I mean, I'm me.

341
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:50,154
Right?

342
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:51,461
And she...

343
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:53,363
Well, she's a cop, for starters.

344
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:55,898
She's a cop?

345
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,188
Yes. I mean, talk about the
shallow end of the dating pool.

346
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:59,623
This is private property.

347
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,379
Unless you have a warrant, you
need to leave here immediately.

348
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:03,473
Security!

349
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:04,808
Security, her, out.

350
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:06,736
Okay, we're gonna take a
ten-minute intermission.

351
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:09,711
- All right? Thank you.
- I haven't finished.

352
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,301
All right.

353
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,435
Oh, it's you again.

354
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:17,816
Have you two...?

355
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:22,291
I know. I'm-I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

356
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:23,934
I... No. No.

357
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:25,628
I've got it under control.

358
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:27,166
And Mr. Morningstar, too, yes.

359
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:28,499
Let me talk to him.

360
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:29,667
It's a her, and no.

361
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,100
Really? Your boss is a she?

362
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,689
Even better. Give me
the phone, I'll fix it.

363
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:33,910
No, you can't fix this!

364
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:35,438
You've already said enough.

365
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:36,220
Sorry!

366
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:38,092
Not you.

367
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:41,048
Yes, I-I'll figure out
a way into the party.

368
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,157
It's not a problem.

369
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,883
And-and again, I...

370
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:48,615
So we're going to the Player after-party.

371
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,690
Not you. I am.

372
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,169
Well, I'm not sure how that's possible,
now that you've blown your cover.

373
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:53,733
Well, that was 100% your fault.

374
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:55,191
I beg to differ.

375
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,809
None of that would have happened if
you'd just complied with my request.

376
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:00,822
Do you honestly think you can just ask
people to have sex with you and they will?

377
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:02,532
Well, I usually don't
have to ask, actually.

378
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,304
But trust me, it'd be a win-win.

379
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,460
And probably another win after that.

380
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:07,672
I mean, I have tremendous stamina.

381
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,489
There's a girl missing, Lucifer.

382
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:11,324
She's probably in some hellhole somewhere,

383
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,484
scared out of her mind,
if she's even still alive.

384
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,266
And I found out the party
is a cash-only event.

385
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,605
That's a first for Carver.

386
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,967
So our only suspect's probably
about to run off to Mexico,

387
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,119
and you're worried about boning me?

388
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,681
You're right. Sorry.

389
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,955
- Let's find the girl. Okay?
- Yes.

390
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,695
Sex later.

391
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,992
Kidding.

392
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:29,992
Sort of.

393
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:32,295
So where's the party?

394
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,486
Cold Bar.

395
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:34,597
Really?

396
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:37,033
Well, that place is
notoriously overpriced to rent.

397
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:39,768
If Carver wants cash, he
shouldn't have it there.

398
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,430
No, he shouldn't.

399
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,004
I think I just figured
out how you can fix this.

400
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:49,103
Oh?

401
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,883
Do tell.

402
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,565
Miss me?

403
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:23,643
I know why you're here. I
won't help you, Amenadiel.

404
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:25,205
One way or another, Maze,

405
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,135
I am gonna change your mind, so...

406
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,259
You're gonna help me
get Lucifer back to Hell.

407
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,752
Don't make it painful.

408
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:36,847
You forget.

409
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,089
I love pain.

410
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:46,626
I'm an angel.

411
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:49,063
You can't beat me, little demon.

412
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:53,489
Stop and hear me out.

413
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:58,777
Men...

414
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,146
...they always want to talk.

415
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,270
Enough!

416
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:21,915
We want the same thing!

417
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:24,068
Oh, do we?

418
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:25,737
Let's see.

419
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,872
Uh-oh.

420
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,105
Did I hit a nerve?

421
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:40,618
Mazikeen, we both know

422
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:44,051
that something has
fundamentally changed in Lucifer.

423
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:45,690
Now, aren't you even
the least bit concerned?

424
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:46,875
No.

425
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,869
It's a phase. It'll pass.

426
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:50,395
You're lying to me.

427
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,064
You're lying to yourself.

428
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,150
Now, we can help each other.

429
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:59,408
We can get him back to where he belongs,

430
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:03,112
if you could just provide
me with a weak spot.

431
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,081
Some insight.

432
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:06,824
No...

433
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,006
means no.

434
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:30,351
Uh... hello?

435
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,120
Uh, Lucifer?

436
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:34,832
Be out in a moment. Just getting ready.

437
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,268
Okay.

438
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:38,280
Uh, did you do what I told you to do

439
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:40,332
and call Carver about the Player's Club?

440
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,572
Make yourself a drink, Detective.

441
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:45,824
No. No. No more drinks.

442
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,346
No more blurred lines.

443
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:51,116
No more breaking into my house
or trying to sleep with me.

444
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,032
Look, this is a professional relationship.

445
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:57,031
I'm a police officer, and you...

446
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:05,335
...are naked. Oh...

447
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,138
Speaking of my surprise visit yesterday,
I decided turnabout's fair play.

448
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:12,049
You know, tit for tat sort of thing.

449
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:14,445
This is beyond inappropriate.

450
00:21:14,512 --> 00:21:15,947
And brave, wouldn't you say?

451
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:19,484
Number three on the
C.K.C. list: take risks.

452
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,654
Okay. Just...

453
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:31,103
Lucifer, put some freakin' clothes on.

454
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,182
All right.

455
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:36,245
But seriously, darling, are you well?

456
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,781
The berries are ripe and
ready to be harvested.

457
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:42,137
I mean, look at me.

458
00:21:42,172 --> 00:21:43,838
Huh?

459
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,868
Now, you can't argue with that, can you?

460
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,258
What happened to...

461
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:01,880
My God.

462
00:22:01,974 --> 00:22:02,827
Oh, oh.

463
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:04,562
Well, yes, I suppose it is his fault.

464
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:05,630
Whose fault?

465
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:06,926
My father.

466
00:22:07,004 --> 00:22:08,366
Your dad did that to you?

467
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:11,092
No, no, no. That's
where I cut my wings off.

468
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:12,804
- What?
- Well, I didn't.

469
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,361
Maze did. I told her to.

470
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:15,941
N-No.

471
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:17,964
Seriously.

472
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,646
What is that?

473
00:22:23,346 --> 00:22:25,513
Don't, please.

474
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,423
Okay.

475
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:36,227
I should get dressed.
Otherwise, we'll miss the party.

476
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:38,084
So you did make the call?

477
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,540
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

478
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:40,598
Party's at Lux.

479
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:43,029
Turns out, the words "open
bar" are indeed effective.

480
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:45,263
So good on you.

481
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:46,052
Okay.

482
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:48,487
Can't go wearing that scruffy little getup.

483
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:50,722
You'll stick out like a sore cop.

484
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,507
Where did you get this dress anyhow?

485
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,922
Oh, it was left behind by
one of my overnight guests.

486
00:23:05,005 --> 00:23:06,624
What was she wearing when she left?

487
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,126
- A smile.
- Mm.

488
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:11,205
If I get an STD from this
thing, I'm gonna kill you.

489
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,331
Oh, there he is.

490
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:16,447
Oh, he doesn't look suspicious at all.

491
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,670
Hmm, so what's the plan, Detective?

492
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,487
Avoid him for now.

493
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:22,913
Mingle, find people who
were at the party last week.

494
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:25,376
See if anyone saw Carver
with our missing girl.

495
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:26,598
- Hey.
- Hi.

496
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:29,166
- Are you from Tennessee?
- No.

497
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,115
Because you're the only ten I see.

498
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:33,799
Oh, you poor soul. Does that actually work?

499
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:35,653
- No.
- No, I didn't think so.

500
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:36,960
It's cute.

501
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,189
It-it is?

502
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:39,478
Yeah.

503
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:41,426
Y-You're cute.

504
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,627
You're really cute.

505
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:45,329
Hey, were you at that party last week?

506
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:46,980
Uh, no, actually, this is my first.

507
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:48,800
Okay.

508
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:51,258
I love this song!

509
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:52,370
Okay.

510
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:54,516
Hey, oh, were you at the party last week?

511
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:57,769
Uh, I think the dress may
have backfired, actually.

512
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:01,659
I think we've been spotted.

513
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:05,164
Clearly a man with nothing to hide.

514
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:07,818
Move!

515
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:09,420
Get out of the way!

516
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:10,888
Just...

517
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:11,989
get out.

518
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,491
Move!

519
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:15,906
Just come...

520
00:24:16,132 --> 00:24:17,578
Give me the gun, Carver.

521
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:18,830
Just-just let me go, okay?

522
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:19,924
I need to go!

523
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,387
I'm afraid that's not possible, but
I do have another option for you.

524
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:24,902
How about a broken back, hmm?

525
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:29,945
You don't understand, I have to go!

526
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,560
They're gonna kill her now!

527
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,144
You just killed Lindsay!

528
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,985
They? They who?

529
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,790
The people who took her.

530
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,163
- Where is Lindsay?
- I don't know, okay?

531
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:51,974
I swear to you, somebody kidnapped her.

532
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,098
If that's the case, then why
wouldn't you go to the cops?

533
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:56,572
Because they said they'd kill her if I did.

534
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:57,640
Maybe they already have.

535
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:58,856
Excuse me, dear, I don't know why we bother

536
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:01,332
with all these pithy
little police questions.

537
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,945
Tell me...

538
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:05,798
...what game's the player playing, eh?

539
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,826
What are you after?

540
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:12,229
I just want Lindsay back.

541
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:15,146
I swear, I would never hurt her.

542
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,261
I love her.

543
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:21,605
But she's a fluffy bunny.

544
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,384
You're a wolf.

545
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:24,862
You-You've built an empire on
the objectification of women.

546
00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:26,892
Yeah, I know. I'm a complete hypocrite.

547
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,092
But I-I would give
anything to get her back.

548
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,652
You humans.

549
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:34,204
You never cease to amaze.

550
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:36,986
Okay, Carver,

551
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:38,214
say what you're saying is true.

552
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:39,916
How long have you and
Lindsay been together?

553
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:41,284
Four months.

554
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,874
Next Tuesday.

555
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:44,625
I tried to keep it quiet,

556
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,303
'cause, you know, I'm
the man and everything.

557
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:49,678
I guess it got out.

558
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:53,335
So you're saying you slept with
Lindsay on multiple occasions,

559
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,931
but you still want to be with her?

560
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,592
Yes, and for the rest of my life.

561
00:25:57,627 --> 00:25:58,448
Well, after four months,

562
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:01,593
you haven't got her, you
know, out of your system?

563
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:03,125
How's that possible?

564
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:04,711
Okay.

565
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,044
You have no idea where
they're holding Lindsay?

566
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,009
No. But they did send this to me...

567
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:14,128
...after the seminar.

568
00:26:16,928 --> 00:26:19,121
Said no more cops or she's dead.

569
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:22,391
So the kidnappers were
there yesterday watching you.

570
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:24,567
I just hope they weren't at the party.

571
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:25,838
If they hurt her, I...

572
00:26:25,873 --> 00:26:27,568
It's okay.

573
00:26:27,982 --> 00:26:31,267
Is there anyone you suspect
that might do this to you?

574
00:26:31,302 --> 00:26:31,977
Enemies?

575
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:34,709
Uh, I'm kind of a polarizing guy.

576
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:36,511
Okay, the hater list is long.

577
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:39,529
Hello there, this is Lucifer Morningstar.

578
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:43,583
Who are you talking to?

579
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:45,485
- Shh.
- Do not shush me.

580
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,624
- Who's on the phone?
- All one word, that's right.

581
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:50,757
Yes, I'll be speaking on
Carver's behalf from now on.

582
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:53,056
No, I'm not a cop.

583
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:54,264
I assure you.

584
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,259
- Is that the...
- Yes, it's the kidnappers.

585
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:57,574
What are you doing?

586
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:59,370
Of course we have the money.

587
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:01,097
Just give me a time and location.

588
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:02,591
Give me the phone.

589
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:04,310
No, I promise you, no police.

590
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:05,773
All right?

591
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,822
Okay, then.

592
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:07,993
- See you shortly. Bye-bye.
- Wait, wait.

593
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,538
Wait, we need proof of life.

594
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:11,173
Oh.

595
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:12,808
Um, just a minute.

596
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,970
How do we know Lindsay's still alive?

597
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,599
No, they've hung up.

598
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:18,597
What are you doing?

599
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:20,215
Not to worry. I've handled it.

600
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,465
I'll be making an exchange
on your behalf this evening.

601
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,714
Cash for your lady love, all right?

602
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,191
Really?

603
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:29,283
Uh, but why would you do that for me?

604
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:31,898
Well, isn't it obvious?

605
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,053
Number two on your list: be a protector.

606
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:35,341
Is it working?

607
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:36,841
You're not doing this alone.

608
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:37,957
Afraid so.

609
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:39,235
I promised, no police.

610
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,999
A deal's a deal, especially
one with the Devil.

611
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,111
Besides, I'm the only one
not risking his life on this.

612
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:47,480
Immortal, remember?

613
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,603
Carver,

614
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:55,418
I'm all right.

615
00:27:56,518 --> 00:27:57,910
I'm a...

616
00:27:57,992 --> 00:28:00,376
I don't know where I am.

617
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:02,625
Please come get me.

618
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,236
I love you.

619
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:06,751
Please.

620
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,259
I'm coming with you.

621
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:10,821
No, I can't let you do that.

622
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,799
I'm not gonna call this in,
but you have to stay here.

623
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:15,268
No discussion. I'm coming with you.

624
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:16,372
Fine.

625
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,674
You'll have to wait in the car.

626
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,660
Ten more minutes.

627
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:46,969
Patience.

628
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,499
Something doesn't feel right.

629
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:51,326
Well, of course it
doesn't. It's a kidnapping.

630
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:54,944
Cool ranch puff?

631
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:55,878
No, thanks.

632
00:28:55,913 --> 00:28:57,806
- No?
- Mm.

633
00:28:57,877 --> 00:28:59,557
It's funny, isn't it? You'd
think the king of hellfire

634
00:28:59,592 --> 00:29:03,619
would be more of a flaming hot
guy, but love these bad boys.

635
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:07,370
Okay, let's say you really are the Devil.

636
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:09,511
All-powerful, immortal, blah, blah, blah.

637
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:11,429
Does that mean you don't feel pain at all?

638
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:13,369
Hmm. I like this line of questioning.

639
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:15,431
Does this mean you're
finally coming around?

640
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:18,067
No. Just answer the question.

641
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:21,146
Well, I... I do feel something,

642
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:23,666
but it's not pain so much as, uh,

643
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:25,565
a pressure, a nuisance, really.

644
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,972
Okay, so what does it
feel like if you get shot?

645
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,177
Ow.

646
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:34,800
Well, you asked.

647
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:37,057
But that's it? Like, a
bullet just bounces off you?

648
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:40,461
Well, there's no wound or
blood, if that's what you mean.

649
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:42,714
Can verify with something
sharp if you like.

650
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:45,294
No, it's not necessary.
It's tempting though.

651
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:46,595
Huh.

652
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:49,566
So, does this mean that you believe me?

653
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:52,911
I'm afraid I can't offer anything
obvious like a tail as proof.

654
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:55,089
- And so no horns.
- No, afraid not.

655
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:56,906
That's the stuff of movies and TV.

656
00:29:56,941 --> 00:29:57,607
Mm-hmm.

657
00:29:57,642 --> 00:29:59,041
They always get it wrong.

658
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:00,917
Well, look, I-I have to admit,

659
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:02,727
I've seen some things I can't explain,

660
00:30:02,762 --> 00:30:05,729
but I don't believe in
all that Bible stuff.

661
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:07,906
So you're an atheist. How ironic.

662
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:09,824
No, not exactly.

663
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:13,722
I do believe there's good
and evil and right and wrong.

664
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:17,149
But the whole fiery damnation thing, no.

665
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:18,247
Does it scare you?

666
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:22,755
No, I mean, how could I be scared
of something that I don't believe in?

667
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:27,559
Do I scare you?

668
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:31,674
No.

669
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:37,716
Is that Carver?

670
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:39,078
Hmm?

671
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:42,254
How did he get here?

672
00:30:42,328 --> 00:30:43,325
Oh, he must have followed us.

673
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,396
- Well done, Detective.
- No, he didn't follow us.

674
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:47,045
He must have gotten the address somehow.

675
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,578
Or someone told him.

676
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:52,013
Either way, he's gonna get
someone killed, probably himself.

677
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,114
This love thing makes you
all quite stupid, doesn't it?

678
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:12,181
Lucifer!

679
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,654
Lucifer!

680
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:26,905
Sorry, but I gave my word... no police.

681
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,054
Seriously?

682
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:29,341
Don't worry, Detective.

683
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:30,899
I'm immortal, remember?

684
00:31:30,986 --> 00:31:33,639
I knew it.

685
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,653
Hey, guys, I'm gonna need
you sooner than I thought.

686
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:36,897
Is SWAT ready?

687
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:04,941
Manly as ever.

688
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:06,237
Why are you here?

689
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:07,713
We had a perfectly good plan in place.

690
00:32:07,748 --> 00:32:10,219
Well, after you left, the
kidnappers called back.

691
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:14,216
They said they changed their
minds, and I come or the deal's off.

692
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:16,748
Oh, that sounds sinister.

693
00:32:17,474 --> 00:32:19,594
Just hand over the cash,

694
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:21,078
and no one gets hurt.

695
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,046
Yes, right. Got it here.

696
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,474
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Where's Lindsay?!

697
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:26,565
I want to see her.

698
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,136
No. My rules.

699
00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:30,089
Money first.

700
00:32:30,134 --> 00:32:33,008
Now, Mr. Kidnapper, I believe
that's a fair request actually,

701
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,813
so just pop her around
and the money's yours.

702
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,846
Greedy little jackal, aren't you?

703
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:43,781
Give it to me!

704
00:32:43,816 --> 00:32:45,840
Most certainly will not.

705
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:47,653
Hey, f-forget it!

706
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:50,240
Just-just give it to him!

707
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:52,450
I just want her back.

708
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:54,066
Fine.

709
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:56,597
Now bring us the girl.

710
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:58,144
I'm sorry.

711
00:32:58,206 --> 00:32:59,285
That's not gonna happen.

712
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,496
What?

713
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:01,569
I will kill you!

714
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,634
Oh, it's gonna happen.

715
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:05,840
A deal's a deal.

716
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,209
I am not leaving here without Lindsay.

717
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:10,431
No way.

718
00:33:12,248 --> 00:33:14,193
Dearie me.

719
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:16,839
What is it about you and guns, eh?

720
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,658
Carver?

721
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:25,373
Oh, no.

722
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,416
Lindsay?

723
00:33:32,517 --> 00:33:34,402
Wait. <i>Lindsay</i> Lindsay?

724
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:35,725
Love of your life Lindsay?

725
00:33:35,778 --> 00:33:38,659
Yeah, sorry, but I can't
let you shoot my brother.

726
00:33:38,764 --> 00:33:40,450
What's up, jackass?

727
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,781
I don't understand.

728
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:43,744
Don't you though?

729
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:47,238
This foul woman and her backwood
brother played the player.

730
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:49,308
Lindsay kidnapped herself.

731
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,959
Hell truly hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

732
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:53,348
You did scorn her, didn't you?

733
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:55,180
No. No.

734
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:58,441
For the first time in my life, I didn't.

735
00:33:59,156 --> 00:34:01,256
I loved her.

736
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,510
I love you.

737
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,300
Love me?

738
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:08,130
Are you kidding? You didn't
even remember my name!

739
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:09,454
What are you talking about?

740
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,183
I met you two years ago, Carver.

741
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:14,196
We slept together.

742
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,836
And then you never called again.

743
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:18,553
Guess I was research for your stupid book.

744
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:20,308
No, no, that's not possible.

745
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:22,194
No, I-I would've remembered.

746
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,617
Nope.

747
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:25,605
I met you at the library.

748
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:29,128
It's a good place to score desperate babes.

749
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:31,502
That's in Chapter 11, I believe.

750
00:34:31,556 --> 00:34:32,793
Oh, that's bad.

751
00:34:32,828 --> 00:34:34,762
I was a virgin, Carver.

752
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,170
That's worse.

753
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:37,575
It was just another night for you,

754
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:39,946
but it was a big deal for me.

755
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:43,571
Oh, God, I'm... I am so sorry, Lindsay.

756
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,689
I-I'm different now.

757
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:48,171
No, I don't think so.

758
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:49,311
But I am.

759
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:50,510
Okay, may I speak now?

760
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:52,404
Because I happen to be
an expert on punishment,

761
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,564
and I'm not sure it fits the crime here.

762
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,661
I mean, Carver made a mistake...

763
00:34:56,704 --> 00:34:58,453
well, several really...

764
00:34:58,488 --> 00:34:59,965
but...

765
00:35:00,045 --> 00:35:01,415
you're different.

766
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:02,533
He's changed.

767
00:35:02,613 --> 00:35:05,668
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

768
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:07,874
Shut up.

769
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,223
You shouldn't even be here.

770
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:11,779
Now you're dead, too.

771
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:12,927
Shoot them, Linds.

772
00:35:13,002 --> 00:35:15,128
Sorry, can't let you do that, darling.

773
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:16,968
I mean, I'm indestructible,

774
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:18,203
but he's off limits as well, I'm afraid.

775
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:20,627
No, she's right. I-I deserve it.

776
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:22,275
No, you don't.

777
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:24,316
Chlamydia, the clap,

778
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:25,730
raging case of crabs...

779
00:35:25,785 --> 00:35:28,489
that's what you deserve, not death.

780
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:31,116
And you...

781
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:33,181
...how are you any better?

782
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:36,570
Why do humans think they can
rectify one evil with another?

783
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,733
I mean, it's clearly the first time

784
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,448
this reptile has truly loved a woman,

785
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:41,786
and this is his reward?

786
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:42,883
Get away from her!

787
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:49,022
Oh, God.

788
00:35:49,187 --> 00:35:51,501
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

789
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:53,174
Please don't hurt me.

790
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,973
Why does everyone say that
before they're punished?

791
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:58,651
Don't kill me!

792
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:00,711
Lucifer.

793
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:01,929
Don't move.

794
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:04,271
Detective, you should leave.

795
00:36:06,651 --> 00:36:07,822
Who are you?

796
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,024
What are you?

797
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:32,056
Did you do this?

798
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:34,252
I've been trying to
tell you, I'm the Devil.

799
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:37,496
That's... that's not possible.

800
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:40,056
I assure you, Detective, it is.

801
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:42,827
I mean, you've said yourself,
there are things you can't explain.

802
00:36:42,955 --> 00:36:45,164
You need more proof? You've
got the gun. Come on, shoot me.

803
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:47,032
No.

804
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,467
I can't shoot you.

805
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,436
Sure you can. Go on, give her
a squeeze, we'll be good to go.

806
00:36:51,471 --> 00:36:54,246
- No.
- Just shoot me, Detective!

807
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,956
Please! Because maybe
you'll finally realize...

808
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,275
Good for you!

809
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:03,815
See? Hardly hurts.

810
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,564
I can't believe...

811
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,723
Gah. Actually, no, it's
hurting a little bit.

812
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,615
It's... Gah! It's hurting a lot.

813
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:11,590
Son of a bitch, that really hurts!

814
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:16,027
I'm bleeding.

815
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:18,063
- You're bleeding.
- I'm bleeding.

816
00:37:18,098 --> 00:37:20,165
Oh, crap, of course you're bleeding.

817
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:22,884
God, what have I done?

818
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:25,315
I don't... I don't bleed. It's...

819
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:28,573
Lucifer,

820
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:30,323
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

821
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:31,713
What does this mean?

822
00:37:31,822 --> 00:37:32,753
Well, it means I shot you.

823
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:34,624
And I'm an idiot, and I'm sorry.

824
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,547
And I'm in so much trouble.

825
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,308
Ah! It really hurts!

826
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,037
What's happening to me?

827
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,544
Well, speak of the devil.

828
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,281
Mr. Morningstar here was just telling
me everything you did in there.

829
00:38:10,317 --> 00:38:11,812
Right.

830
00:38:11,847 --> 00:38:12,686
Well, Lieutenant...

831
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:14,614
I was just telling your
boss if you hadn't acted

832
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:16,839
in the way that you did, then,

833
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:18,453
well, all hell would've broke loose.

834
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,318
Isn't that right?

835
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:22,728
Right.

836
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:23,862
Mm.

837
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:26,598
Absolutely. And, um...

838
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:29,271
But you caught the bad
guys; that's the main thing.

839
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:32,515
Again, I'm sorry that you got caught
in the crossfire, Mr. Morningstar.

840
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:34,749
Oh, it's just a graze. I hardly felt it.

841
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:38,483
And call me Lucifer.

842
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:42,201
Lucifer.

843
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:49,291
Thank you again for all of your help.

844
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:51,598
You are so welcome.

845
00:38:55,762 --> 00:38:57,896
Bye, now.

846
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:04,669
I thought you didn't lie.

847
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,137
I don't.

848
00:39:07,507 --> 00:39:10,008
But I don't always tell the whole truth.

849
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:12,406
Thank you.

850
00:39:13,403 --> 00:39:15,914
You're welcome.

851
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:18,357
Come on, I'll drive you home.

852
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,148
I should bloody hope so,
now you've crippled me.

853
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:22,642
Wuss.

854
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:29,838
Thanks, Julia.

855
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:32,153
Have a good night. Drive safe.

856
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:40,674
Mommy!

857
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:42,367
Hey!

858
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:43,779
What are you doing up?

859
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:45,543
Can't sleep when you're not home.

860
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:46,845
Come on, I'll tuck you in.

861
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,393
What's that on your shirt?

862
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:51,676
Oh.

863
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,594
Um, that's, uh... that's
ketchup from lunch.

864
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,448
Nuh-uh. That's blood, Mom.

865
00:39:57,518 --> 00:39:59,544
Right. You're right.

866
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:03,965
Well, um... I may have hit someone...

867
00:40:04,024 --> 00:40:04,810
with a bullet.

868
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:07,780
You shot someone? Again?

869
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:08,800
Barely.

870
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:09,767
Who?

871
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:10,703
It was Lucifer.

872
00:40:10,738 --> 00:40:12,570
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

873
00:40:12,606 --> 00:40:13,514
It was nothing.

874
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:16,350
It was, like, a little graze.

875
00:40:16,442 --> 00:40:18,316
Okay.

876
00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:22,078
What, babe?

877
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:24,471
Remember last week, I
told you that boy Noah

878
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:27,022
kept throwing French
fries at me at lunchtime?

879
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,839
- Mm-hmm.
- And you said

880
00:40:28,903 --> 00:40:31,570
it actually might mean he likes me?

881
00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:32,334
Yes.

882
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:35,848
Well, since you <i>shot</i> Lucifer,

883
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:39,478
it must mean you <i>really</i> like him.

884
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:45,436
Hmm.

885
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:47,839
You know, it is bedtime, you little weasel.

886
00:40:47,874 --> 00:40:50,934
You weasel. I'm gonna get you.

887
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:52,812
Story time! Story time!

888
00:41:02,322 --> 00:41:03,588
I know.

889
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:04,913
Tough day at the office.

890
00:41:04,948 --> 00:41:05,770
What happened to you?

891
00:41:05,805 --> 00:41:07,666
Oh, you'll never guess.

892
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,293
She shot me.

893
00:41:09,794 --> 00:41:11,043
And I bled.

894
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:12,143
What?

895
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:13,109
That's not possible.

896
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,574
I know.

897
00:41:14,901 --> 00:41:16,197
What's causing this?

898
00:41:16,275 --> 00:41:17,618
Is there something you're not telling me?

899
00:41:17,653 --> 00:41:19,474
Don't think about it
too much. It's exciting.

900
00:41:19,532 --> 00:41:21,997
No, it's dangerous.

901
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:26,811
We've had our fun here,
Lucifer, but this can't happen.

902
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:30,982
Tell me we're going home.

903
00:41:31,017 --> 00:41:34,175
On the contrary, Maze.

904
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,055
The fun's just begun.
