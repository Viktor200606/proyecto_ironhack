Hey, Leonard, if you're

I have to do a little
reception after work.

4
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:08,889
Oh, I would, but we need to make
a push on the air force project.

Oh, are you sure?

6
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:11,889
We're celebrating
our new A.D.D. drug,

- the guidance system tomorrow?
- Yeah, why?

Well, Sheldon said that

We've had this planned
for a week.

Hey, Raj, do you want
to go with me tomorrow?

17
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:36,405
Are you asking because you
want me there or out of pity?

18
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,960
Actually, never mind,
don't answer.

you're working on

22
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:46,147
- the gyroscope tomorrow?
- Because I am.

23
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:48,527
- But you said you were working with me.
- Uh-oh.

And for your information,
the summer conference

28
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:02,928
on algebraic topology
at Caltech is nerd prom.

00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:05,592
I'm sorry, what is
this plan you have?

30
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:08,514
Well, I'm not needed at
both places at the same time.

31
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:11,420
And I can also free up extra
hours with simple tricks,

32
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:14,710
such as using a minimal amount
of words to convey my point.

33
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:17,193
When does that start?

34
00:01:18,014 --> 00:01:19,311
Soon.

35
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:20,378
See, I could've said

36
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,177
"in the near future," but I
didn't say "in the near future,"

37
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:25,155
'cause "in the near future" is
three more words than "soon."

38
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:28,131
"In" one, "the" two, "near"
three, "future" four.

39
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,104
See "in the near future"
is four, "soon" is just one,

40
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:33,054
four is more than one;
saving time already.

You know, there was a time
I would say "God bless you,"

and then you would say "If you
must invoke an imaginary deity,

how about Thor?"

154
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:27,766
And I would say,

155
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:29,206
"How do you know
I didn't mean Thor?"

156
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,562
And then you would say "Touché,"

157
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,945

That didn't happen.

175
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,651
You also got a nosebleed
watching <i>Up.</i>

176
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:08,261

00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:14,089
Stuart, you didn't
have to make dinner.

178
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,308
Yeah, well, I felt bad about
upsetting you this morning.

179
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,589
And to be honest, I'm not the
biggest fan of your meatloaf.

180

Hey, what's for dinner?

181
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:25,527
Meatloaf.

Oh, cool.

Oh, cool.

Hey, I was thinking

186
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:35,124
maybe we take Halley
to the zoo this weekend,

187
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,641
get in a little family time

188
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,259

00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:39,507
Sounds great.

Speaking of which, for day care,

191
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:42,826
it'll be easy for me

192
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:45,399

you want to do it.

No, I'm fine.
You sure?

200

what the right thing to do is.

348
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,617
If I go back to work,
I'm abandoning Halley.

349
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:05,992
If I don't go,

350
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:08,047
I'm giving up
everything I worked for.

351
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:10,453
It's like
there's no right choice.

352
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,375
Look, I don't know what
the best decision is, either.

353
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:18,594
But whatever we choose,
if we're not happy,

354
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:20,062
we can undo it.

355
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:21,442
I guess.

356
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:23,766
And the best part is:
Halley won't remember a thing.

357
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:27,438
Babies are cute,
but they're dumb.

358
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,625
I-I go like this,

359
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:32,523
she thinks I'm gone. Then
magically I'm back. I mean...

360
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:37,430
Honestly,
why are we saving for college?

361
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:41,328
I'm not crazy about
you calling our baby dumb.

362
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,041
Well, she gets it from me.

363
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:45,437
Speaking of which,

364
