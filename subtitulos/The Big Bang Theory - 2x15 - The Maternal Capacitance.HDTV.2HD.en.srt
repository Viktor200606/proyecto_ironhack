1
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:29,612
Fellas, please.

2
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,805
Penny, come on.
We were just finding our sound.

3
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:35,628
You found it.

4
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:38,746
It's the sound of a cat
being run over by a lawn mower.

5
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:42,006
I'm really very busy.

6
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:43,911
Is there any way
that we can put this off

7
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:46,093
until I have more time to prepare?

8
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:49,423
Of course.
But, you understand my trepidation.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,456
- What's that about?
- Not a clue.

10
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,992
Can't we just postpone it
till the spring?

11
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:55,513
Maybe next summer?

12
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,428
This should be fairly
easy to deduce.

13
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:59,562
He's holding the phone
to his left ear.

14
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:02,426
Ears do not cross hemispheres,
so he's using the analytical

15
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,617
rather than the emotional side
of the brain,

16
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:08,054
suggesting that he has no personal
relationship with the caller.

17
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:10,779
No, I didn't realize
it had been so long.

18
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:14,491
Sure, I guess there's no other choice
but to just go ahead and do it.

19
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,826
He's referring to an activity
he has done before.

20
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,044
It's unpleasant
and needs to be repeated.

21
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:21,677
This suggests some sort
of invasive medical test,

22
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:24,206
like perhaps a colonoscopy.

23
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:27,559
Aren't there any other options?
There's not a lot of room.

24
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:29,964
- It's gonna be uncomfortable.
- Yes, yes.

25
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:32,859
I'm definitely going
with colonoscopy.

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,298
Okay, bye.

27
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,373
My mother's coming to visit.

28
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,951
How about that, you were right.

29
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,592

Transcript: YYeTs

30
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:17,151
It's out of order.

31
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:20,926
Yes, I can read the sign.
I'm just pondering the implications.

32
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:25,779
I think it implies
that the elevator doesn't work.

33
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,315
Again, I can read the sign.

34
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:32,651
But the sign and the tape
are covered with a layer of dust,

35
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,258
which indicates that the elevator
has been nonfunctional

36
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,054
for a significant amount of time.

37
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:39,388
Which suggests
either a remarkable passivity

38
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:40,828
among the, I assume,

39
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,245
24 to 36 residents of this building,

40
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,008
based on the number of mailboxes

41
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,590
and given typical
urban population density

42
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:50,555
or a shared delusion
of functionality.

43
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:54,464
You must be Leonard's mother.

44
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,400
I don't know if I must be, but yes.

45
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,481
I'm Penny.
I'm his neighbor.

46
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:02,223
Dr. Beverly Hofstadter.

47
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:03,933
Nice to meet you.

48
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:06,680
You're a hand shaker.
Interesting.

49
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:12,191
Come with me.
I'll walk you to the apartment.

50
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:15,361
Would you like to exchange
pleasantries on the way?

51
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:18,197
- Yeah, sure, I guess.
- All right, you start.

52
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:22,924
I've always been curious. What was
Leonard like when he was little?

53
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,999
I think you mean young.
He's always been little.

54
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,062
Right.
What was he like when he was young?

55
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:31,287
You'll have to be more specific.

56
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:34,255
Okay, like, five or six.

57
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:41,108
Five.

58
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:43,286
At that age, he was well enmeshed

59
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:46,664
in what Freud would call the phallic
stage of psychosexual development.

60
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:49,248
An outmoded theory, of course,
but the boy did spend

61
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:52,668
most of his waking hours
with a tight grasp on his penis.

62
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,786
Leonard mentioned
you were a psychiatrist.

63
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:59,461
That is one of my degrees.
My primary field is neuroscience.

64
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:02,408
Well, I'm an actress.

65
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:08,321
Why?

66
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,375
What do you mean why?

67
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,112
There are studies that
suggest that many who go into

68
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:17,756
the performing arts suffer from
an external locus of identity.

69
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:23,442
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

70
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,088
It means you value yourself
only as others value you,

71
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:31,924
which is often the result
of unmet childhood emotional needs.

72
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,774
I had a wonderful childhood.

73
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:37,818
Tell me about it.

74
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,483
I know my dad wanted a boy.

75
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,235
I tried being good at sports,
but I hated getting dirty!

76
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:54,293
And then, I'm assuming,
you entered adolescence.

77
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:57,562
He called me Slugger
until I got my first training bra.

78
00:04:57,687 --> 00:05:00,587
And then he just stopped
playing catch with me.

79
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,762
I wasn't Slugger anymore.

80
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,317
Your mother's here!

81
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:15,776
If you want
to have intercourse with that girl,

82
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,751
find out what kind of cologne
her father wore.

83
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,816
Good to see you, Mother.

84
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,860
Here's your tea, Mother.

85
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:28,921
Oolong?

86
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,234
Loose, not bagged?

87
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,606
Steeped three minutes?

88
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,919
Two-percent milk?

89
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:34,289
Warmed separately?

90
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:35,674
One teaspoon sugar?

91
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:36,835
Raw sugar?

92
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:40,543
It's cold.

93
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:45,837
I'll start again.

94
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:49,890
I have the same problem with him.

95
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,534
My theory is that his lack of focus
stems from an over-developed sex drive.

96
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:00,468
I don't know
where he would've gotten that.

97
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,246
Aside from a pro forma
consummation of our marriage,

98
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:07,327
his father and I only had intercourse
for the purposes of reproduction.

99
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:11,182
That seems a fairly efficient
arrangement.

100
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:14,164
Yes, we think so.
We've both done papers on it.

101
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,709
Mine from the neuroscientific
point of view

102
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,977
and his from an anthropological.

103
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:21,999
Mine, of course,
was the onlyne worth reading.

104
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,215
Of course.

105
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,620
I would very much like to read
about your sex life.

106
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,682
It's all online or you can order it
from the Princeton University Press.

107
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:33,822
Here's your tea, Mother.

108
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,437
So, what are you guys talking about?

109
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:39,962
The frequency with which
your parents had intercourse.

110
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:42,397
Swell.

111
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:47,031
If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you
the PowerPoint presentation.

112
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:49,427
I'm sorry, it's on my other laptop.

113
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:52,982
So, Mother...

114
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,119
- what's new?
- You'll have to be more specific.

115
00:06:57,892 --> 00:07:00,085
All right.
What's new with you?

116
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:04,635
Well, I've been having some fascinating
menopausal symptoms recently.

117
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,325
Maybe something less personal.

118
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:11,231
Your Uncle Floyd died.

119
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:13,265
Oh, my God.
What happened?

120
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:15,308
His heart stopped beating.

121
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:18,294
I have to urinate.

122
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:25,706
What a remarkable woman.

123
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:30,809
Yeah, I-I thought you guys
might hit it off.

124
00:07:31,124 --> 00:07:32,924
I envy you your childhood.

125
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:35,801
I hate to tell you,
but the only warm memories

126
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:38,926
I have of my childhood
are of my Uncle Floyd.

127
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,169
You're clearly misremembering.
Your mother is brilliant,

128
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,070
analytical, insightful.

129
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,126
And I'm betting
she never hit you with a Bible

130
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,633
because you wouldn't eat
your Brussels sprouts.

131
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:51,550
You don't give your mother
enough credit.

132
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:53,480
She's warm, she's loving,

133
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,528
she doesn't glue electrodes
to your head

134
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:58,653
to measure your brain waves
while potty training.

135
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:02,665
You were lucky.
When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG,

136
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,900
I had to attach my own electrodes.

137
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:10,953
So, Dr. Hofstadter,
Leonard rarely talks

138
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:13,992
about his incredibly successful
brother and sister.

139
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,711
Please, don't go there.

140
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:17,246
I understand that,

141
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:21,408
unlike Leonard, they're at the top
of their respective fields.

142
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:24,733
Boy, you suck.

143
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,425
Leonard's younger brother, Michael,
is a tenured law professor at Harvard,

144
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,545
and his sister just
successfully grew

145
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,102
a human pancreas
in an adolescent gibbon.

146
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,308
So, she's close to curing diabetes?

147
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:41,562
Why else would you grow
a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?

148
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:44,482
You must be very proud.

149
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,025
Why?
They're not my accomplishments.

150
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:50,042
I have to urinate.

151
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:56,339
- Why are you doing this?
- You know the rules.

152
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:59,364
You brought your mom to work...
you must suffer.

153
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:04,751
I had no idea your siblings
were so much more successful than you.

154
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,410
You're like the Jar Jar Binks
of the Hofstadter family.

155
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:14,684
Oh, mesa think
yousa lookin' so so sad.

156
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,416
Rather than mock me,
my friends might realize

157
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,186
that this is difficult
and try to help me through it.

158
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:25,564
Nope, I think mocking you
is more fun.

159
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:30,156
Next time, don't yousa
bring mama to work. Okee-day?

160
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,781
- That was fast.
- The middle stall was occupied.

161
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,408
I'll have to try again later.

162
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,671
That's totally understandable.
In bladder voiding, as in real estate,

163
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:43,039
it's location, location, location.

164
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:47,290
- So, where were we?
- Howard lives with his mother

165
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:50,238
and Raj can't speak to women
unless he's drunk. Go.

166
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,261
That's fascinating.
Selective mutism is quite rare.

167
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,388
On the other hand, an adult Jewish male
living with his mother is so common

168
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:02,901
it borders on sociological cliché.

169
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:07,147
It's just temporary; I pay rent.

170
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,775
He lives in the same room
where his bassinet was.

171
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,484
Both selective mutism

172
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,905
and an inability
to separate from one's mother

173
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,281
can stem from a pathological
fear of women.

174
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:20,767
It might explain why the two of you have
created an ersatz homosexual marriage

175
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:22,902
to satisfy your need for intimacy.

176
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:32,149
Say what?

177
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:35,964
That's basically what I just said.

178
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,304
You brought your husband to work.
You know the rules.

179
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,059
Meesa thinking yousa looking
pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.

180
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:49,314
Leonard, it's 1:00. Weren't you going
to show me your laboratory at 1:00?

181
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,442
There's no hurry. Tell them more
about their secret love for each other.

182
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:56,579
But it's 1:00. You were going
to show me your laboratory at 1:00.

183
00:10:56,704 --> 00:10:59,168
Her reasoning is unassailable.
It is 1:00.

184
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:03,328
Fine. Let's go.

185
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:07,088
I think you'll find my work
pretty interesting.

186
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:09,382
I'm attempting to replicate
the dark matter signal

187
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:12,045
found in sodium iodide
crystals by the Italians.

188
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,880
So, no original research?

189
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:18,017
What's the point of my seeing it?

190
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:20,757
I could just read the paper
the Italians wrote.

191
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,739
Just for the record, we're not
in an ersatz homosexual relationship.

192
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,702
- Then why didn't you say that to her?
- Why is it always my responsibility?

193
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:32,953
It's not always your responsibility.

194
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:36,467
I swear, this is the same thing you did
at the comic book store last week.

195
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,158
I can't believe
you're bringing that up.

196
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:47,268
- I didn't bring it up. You did.
- We'll talk about this later.

197
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:49,846
You always say that,
but you never do.

198
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:58,383
You went to the comic book store
without me?

199
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,726
- You got alcohol?
- Your mom still here?

200
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,409
Come on in.

201
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:13,857
Wait, she's not gonna come here
looking for you, is she?

202
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,027
Relax. She took Sheldon
to the hospital to get a brain scan.

203
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,029
Oh, my God. What happened?

204
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,997
Nothing.
Mother likes looking at brains

205
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:23,530
and Sheldon likes getting
his brain scanned.

206
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:26,703
Geez, what a fun couple.

207
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:29,242
She's only been here a day and a half

208
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:32,643
and I'm seriously considering alcoholism
as a new career path.

209
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:37,464
I talked to her for 5 minutes yesterday
and I've been half bombed ever since.

210
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:40,425
You can't let her
get into your head.

211
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,178
- My head, what about yours?
- It's too late for me.

212
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,222
My head is her summer house.

213
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:49,292
She was right.

214
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:52,437
The locus of my identity
is totally exterior to me.

215
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,376
Yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.

216
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,455
Do you know where I was all morning?

217
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,196
Auditioning with 50 other blondes

218
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:03,740
for some stupid
antidepressant commercial.

219
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,879
And for what?

220
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:07,364
So I'll finally get
my daddy's approval?

221
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:12,431
- Did you get the part?
- No, they said I was too perky.

222
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:19,473
You want to talk
about not getting love from a parent.

223
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,412
You know what I used to do
when I was little

224
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:23,427
to have some sensation
of human contact?

225
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:25,928
Yeah, you grabbed your penis
and wouldn't let go.

226
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:32,807
Your mother told me.

227
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,106
Of course she did.
That's not what I was gonna say.

228
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:39,322
When I was ten years old,
I built a hugging machine.

229
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:42,398
A hugging machine?

230
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,485
I got a dressmaker's mannequin,

231
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,037
I stuffed it with an electric blanket
so it would be warm,

232
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:48,970
and built two radio-controlled arms

233
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,168
that would hug me and pat my back.

234
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,332
That is so sad.

235
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:58,559
You know what the saddest part was?
My father used to borrow it.

236
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:05,479
Your scan data will be very helpful
to my research.

237
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:07,482
You have a remarkable brain.

238
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:08,607
I know.

239
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:11,971
Although I've always hated

240
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:14,579
how my right frontal lobe
looks in pictures.

241
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,478
Common complaint among men.

242
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:19,127
Nothing's ever big enough.

243
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:23,487
Except when they get a tumor.
Then you never hear the end of it.

244
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,909
I'd love to see
a scan of your brain sometime.

245
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,161
I'll send you a link, but its physiology
is fairly unimpressive.

246
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:33,163
I can't believe that.

247
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,469
Your unwillingness to accept
empirical evidence

248
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:37,665
suggests an attempt at flattery.

249
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:41,054
My apologies.

250
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:44,950
I've been living with your son too long.
Gotten into some bad habits.

251
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:47,093
Understandable.

252
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,498
- Can I make you a cup of tea?
- I doubt it,

253
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,993
but if anyone has a chance,
it's probably you.

254
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,356
I feel very comfortable around you.

255
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:02,859
I feel very comfortable
around you, too.

256
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:04,568
It's surprising

257
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:07,074
because I generally
don't feel comfortable around...

258
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:08,548
well, anyone.

259
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:11,535
Nor I.

260
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,882
What are the odds
that two individuals

261
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:17,494
as unique as ourselves
would be connected

262
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:20,385
by someone as comparatively
workaday as your son?

263
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:26,148
Is that a rhetorical point
or would you like to do the math?

264
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,307
I'd like to do the math.

265
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:33,683
I'd like that, too.

266
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:52,608
Now this time,

267
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:54,604
you're gonna lick the salt...

268
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:56,815
off my neck...

269
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:01,402
do the shot...

270
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:03,879
and then...

271
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,390
bite the lime.

272
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:12,947
I'm sorry, I didn't hear
anything after "lick."

273
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:18,149
Neck, shot, lime.

274
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:28,718
- Shot, lime.
- Right.

275
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,161
Where's the lime?

276
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,274
We're sharing.

277
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,009
So, what do you think?

278
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:05,649
I'm very tempted.

279
00:17:06,617 --> 00:17:09,853
I'm just not sure it's appropriate
with my son's roommate.

280
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,301
Normally, I'd feel the same way.

281
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:16,055
But based on everything
I've observed about us,

282
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,259
I can't help but speculate
we'd be very good together.

283
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:22,499
True. I've had
a similar observation.

284
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:26,908
It's certainly something
I could never do with my husband.

285
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,736
I was hesitant
the first time I tried it,

286
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:34,442
but I experienced an unanticipated

287
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:37,496
and remarkable release
of endorphins.

288
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,019
It's quite satisfying.

289
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,457
I see what you're doing.

290
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:47,198
You're appealing
to the neuroscientific researcher in me.

291
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:51,251
You see right through me, don't you?

292
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,469
Only when you're in a CAT scanner.

293
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,291
This is actually gonna happen.

294
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:09,546
Honey, shush, shush.

295
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,306
You shush, I'm happy.
I want to talk about it.

296
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,315
You know what my mother would say?
She would say

297
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,510
because you weren't loved by your father
and I was not loved by my mother,

298
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:20,797
that having sex is our way
of making up for the intimacy

299
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:22,630
we didn't get as children.

300
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:25,370
Why would you bring that up
right now?

301
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:27,761
I don't know.

302
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:28,815
Foreplay?

303
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,806
So you're saying
you're not having sex with me,

304
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,696
you're having sex with your mother?

305
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:39,189
I'm gonna go with "no."

306
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,068
That is the sickest thing
I've ever heard.

307
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:43,955
Come on,

308
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,250
you're trying to have sex
with your father and I'm okay with that.

309
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:50,122
Get out!

310
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,297
She said shush.
I should have shushed.

311
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:25,371
All right, Mother.

312
00:19:26,147 --> 00:19:27,286
Have a nice flight.

313
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:29,584
That's not really
in my control, is it?

314
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:45,517
- Good morning.
- Morning.

315
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,694
- I was just coming over to talk to you.
- You don't have to.

316
00:19:49,072 --> 00:19:50,072
Ever.

317
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:52,085
Gotcha.

318
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:54,984
- Good-bye, Mother.
- Good-bye.

319
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,293
So, Slugger, shall we pick up
where we left off last time?

320
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,083
I mean, my mom could've just said,

321
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,784
"Bob, get over it,
she's a girl, move on."

322
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:09,749
- But she didn't. Not one word.
- Interesting.

323
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,824
Would you be willing to fly
to New Jersey

324
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:15,151
and discuss your relationship
with your parents during a brain scan?

325
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:19,777
- Would it help?
- Well, it would help me.

9999
