1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,171
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,174 --> 00:00:04,755
We need to figure out who kidnapped me.

3
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:06,490
I'm fairly certain that
my Father's behind it.

4
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:07,959
Lucifer, I'm not angry with you,

5
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:09,885
that you somehow got your wings back,

6
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:11,487
or even that you cut them off again.

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,463
I was tested once, and I failed.

8
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:14,674
I'm not gonna fail again.

9
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:17,194
I suppose this won't bother you.

10
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:18,487
But you cut them off.

11
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,789
The pesky things seem to be

12
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,732
a bit more tenacious this time around.

13
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:22,968
I'm Lieutenant Marcus Pierce.

14
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,403
Heard a lot about you, Lieutenant,

15
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:26,171
and I'm really excited to work with you.

16
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:28,030
Aren't you that corrupt
cop that got off easy?

17
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:28,869
Excuse me?

18
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:30,272
People come to me to ask for favors,

19
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:32,413
and more often than
not, I'm happy to oblige.

20
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,460
What do you get?

21
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:35,646
Simply to be repaid at a later date.

22
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:38,316
A devilish IOU, if you will.

23
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:40,419
Who's the Sinnerman?

24
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:42,187
That's who hired me to kidnap you.

25
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,744
He's a scary dude. Huge crime boss.

26
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:45,955
And where do I find him?

27
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,741
You don't. He finds you.

28
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:09,681
This way.

29
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,746
Ah...

30
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:24,963
You're an angel.

31
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,933
Oh, gosh.

32
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:29,367
Uh, my apologies.

33
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,236
And for the record,
I don't usually suffer

34
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:33,772
from premature unfurling.

35
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:38,134
Right. Now, where were we?

36
00:01:38,137 --> 00:01:40,145
No, keep them out.

37
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:43,315
I'm totally into cosplay.

38
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:46,835
I could dress up as a devil
and make it really sexy.

39
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:51,127
I have no desire to
have sex with myself.

40
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,627
Not right now, at least.

41
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,160
Where are you going?

42
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,329
To do some grooming.

43
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:01,968
I'd recommend you leave. Now.

44
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:05,270
I'm about to engage in
a rather gruesome form

45
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,705
of manscaping.

46
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,340
You cut them off, didn't you?

47
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,242
I did, yes.

48
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:12,477
But then they grew back,
so I cut them off again.

49
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,079
It's like whack-a-mole back there.

50
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,048
I'm worried about you.

51
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,552
What you're describing
is self-mutilation.

52
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:23,255
Doctor, someone is
forcing those wings on me.

53
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:25,023
They took away my devil face.

54
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,827
And I won't stand for someone
making me something I'm not.

55
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:31,846
Are you any closer to
finding out who did this?

56
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,633
Yes. Well, a little.

57
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:36,902
He calls himself "The Sinnerman."

58
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:38,570
From what I can gather,

59
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:41,072
he's a criminal mastermind
who just moved his operation

60
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:43,842
to Los Angeles, but no one
seems to have ever met him,

61
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:46,622
which makes punching him in the
face frustratingly difficult.

62
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,813
Well, maybe...

63
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:50,048
Doctor,

64
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,105
are you sure you're all
right to be back at work?

65
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:53,674
I mean, it really hasn't been that long

66
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:54,818
since Mum flambéed you.

67
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,955
Yes. It certainly was a...

68
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:58,790
traumatic experience.

69
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,092
Fortunately, I'm trained to
deal with that sort of thing,

70
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,440
and I'm doing just that.

71
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,576
And there's nothing I can do to help?

72
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:06,965
Yes. You can let me get back to you.

73
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,900
Oh, if you insist.

74
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:12,671
Oh, I haven't even told
you the worst part, have I?

75
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,539
Not only did he stick my wings back on

76
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,243
and take my face, he's
stolen my shtick as well.

77
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,544
He gives out favors to people

78
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,213
for a price to be named later.

79
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:22,881
Sound familiar?

80
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:27,385
Lucifer, you didn't invent
the idea of giving out favors.

81
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:30,222
Yep, forgot who I was talking to.

82
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:32,197
I suppose you did.

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,593
But you haven't given
out favors in a while.

84
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:36,127
And the Sinnerman knows it.

85
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,854
I think he's taunting me.

86
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:39,431
Do you think he's human?

87
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,999
Or something else?

88
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,701
I don't know.

89
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:46,002
But whatever he is, I'm gonna
stop at nothing to find him.

90
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,237
We found him.

91
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,229
Who? The missing link?

92
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:51,309
Proof of human-rodent copulation.

93
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:52,711
It's Mike Alonso.

94
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:54,843
The guy that skewered your
kidnapper under the pier.

95
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:57,015
This is clearly not the Sinnerman.

96
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,984
Clearly not, since I'm pretty sure

97
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:01,489
that no one with that
name actually exists.

98
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,922
He had motive, no alibi,

99
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,790
and, oh, yeah, he confessed

100
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,795
under interrogation. He's our guy.

101
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,799
Well, then he must be
working for the Sinnerman.

102
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:12,130
You're not gonna drag me

103
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:14,330
into whatever new weird drama this is.

104
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,380
And could you please

105
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:17,107
stop saying "Sinnerman"?

106
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,544
Sinnerman.

107
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:20,919
Big Nina Simone fan?

108
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:22,807
- Well, actually, I am. But I was just saying
- What? Nothing.

109
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:24,708
- to the detective...
- Nothing. It's nothing.

110
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:28,346
Are you hiding something
from me, Detective?

111
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:30,932
No.

112
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:32,668
I don't care, I was just asking.

113
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:35,105
New case came in, you're up.

114
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,588
Thank you.

115
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:40,023
Okay. Why did you just stop
me telling the new lieutenant

116
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,994
we're on the cusp of the
greatest case of our lives?

117
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:45,344
Because the Sinnerman is an
urban myth, he doesn't exist.

118
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:47,398
He's a boogeyman that criminals use

119
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:48,656
to hide their bad behavior.

120
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,059
"Oh, the Sinnerman made me do it."

121
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:51,728
Yet another thing he's stolen from me,

122
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,992
being blamed for the bad deeds of men.

123
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:56,696
- He can keep that one, actually.
- So the idea

124
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,966
of telling our new boss...

125
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:01,057
Who I'm just starting
to get a rhythm with...

126
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:03,293
That you want to arrest the Easter Bunny

127
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:04,550
doesn't really thrill me.

128
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:06,262
I have no intention of arresting anyone.

129
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,831
I want to grab him by his
neck and see what happens

130
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,332
when I squeeze hard enough.

131
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:13,270
If you can bring me
any tiny bit of evidence

132
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,227
that the Sinnerman actually exists,

133
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,773
I will be the first to look into it.

134
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,308
But...

135
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,790
until then, consider this case closed.

136
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:24,006
And let's focus on this case, please.

137
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,148
Okay.

138
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,277
Daniel?

139
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,010
Guy's name is JD Woodstock.

140
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,548
He lived right around the corner.

141
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,950
Neighbors said he was pretty quiet.

142
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,885
Unemployed, but we found this on him.

143
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:03,487
Huh.

144
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:07,062
So what are these? Jokes?

145
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:09,326
A charitable description, Detective.

146
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,493
"Avocado?

147
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,128
How about avoca-don't?"

148
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,195
Would it be rude to throw
tomatoes at a corpse?

149
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:16,047
Looks like he was a struggling comedian.

150
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,968
We're trying to figure out
if he performed anywhere.

151
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,536
What'd he do? Make fun
of the wrong person?

152
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:20,771
Get in a fight with an audience member?

153
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,446
It's worth exploring, at least.

154
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,307
You know, there are a lot
of insult comics out there,

155
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:26,076
and not everybody enjoys being mocked.

156
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:27,744
Hmm. We should listen
to Daniel, actually.

157
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:29,594
He's got a unique
insight into this case.

158
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,214
What's he talking about?

159
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:32,549
Well, they're kindred spirits.

160
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:33,993
A fellow broken soul who puts

161
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:35,752
the most embarrassing
parts of his life on display

162
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,220
for his audience for an easy laugh.

163
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,453
He does stand-up, I do improv.

164
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:40,756
They're completely different things.

165
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:42,025
- Oh.
- Improv

166
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,260
is all about "yes, and."

167
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:44,861
Stand-up, well, that's
about telling jokes...

168
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,696
I-I regret starting
this entire conversation.

169
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,857
Wait. Excuse me, Dan.

170
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,100
You do improv?

171
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:52,469
How did I not know that? And how did he?

172
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:53,960
- Well, it's a funny story, actually.
- Actually,

173
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,906
it's because I-I don't
tell a lot of people.

174
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,140
Why?

175
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:58,675
Yeah... hey, Ella.

176
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:00,343
How's it going? What'd you find?

177
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:03,513
Well, no murder weapon, but I
did find three shell casings.

178
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,348
Running ballistics on them now.

179
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,251
But, based on the firing pattern,

180
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:11,388
I think this dude was tortured
before he finally died.

181
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,646
Oh, well congratulations, Mr. Woodstock.

182
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:15,749
At least someone cared
enough about your jokes to...

183
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:17,015
Did you just say Woodstock?

184
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,628
As in, JD Woodstock?

185
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,963
Yeah. Why? You know him?

186
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,464
Yeah. He made big
news a couple days ago,

187
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,266
claiming Bobby Lowe stole his jokes.

188
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,135
And who is Bobby Lowe? A rival comedian

189
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:27,637
who hates himself so
much he stole this drivel?

190
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,840
Uh, no.

191
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:32,475
Open your eyes, pal.

192
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:34,744
Yeah. JD claimed that Bobby's show

193
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,246
was based on his own material.

194
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,579
And that he could prove it.

195
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,949
Which is impossible,

196
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:41,486
because Bobby Lowe's show
is all about his life.

197
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:43,553
Wait, so you're saying that
this giant-headed buffoon

198
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:45,221
stole our poor victim's ideas?

199
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:47,946
His life's work and built
a business out of it?

200
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:50,476
Mm. So now he's a "poor victim."

201
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,617
Look, I know you don't
believe me, Detective,

202
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,521
but I happen to be going
through something quite similar,

203
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:56,122
so if I can't get my own justice,

204
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,135
I'm gonna get it for
this poor unfunny soul.

205
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:02,322
Well, I certainly did want
you to focus on this case,

206
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,592
but be careful what you wish for.

207
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:06,392
At least the lieutenant isn't here.

208
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:09,260
You know, if you keep saying
crazy things around him,

209
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:11,065
who knows what he might do.

210
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:13,216
Right. When have I ever
cared about that, Detective?

211
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:14,751
Ah, that's true.

212
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:25,404
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

213
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,067
I sweated over every joke.

214
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,182
Worked my ass off for months.

215
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:39,218
And Bobby stole it all
like it was nothing.

216
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,556
Created a show based on my jokes!

217
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:45,725
Well Bobby, guess what?

218
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,360
I finally found it.

219
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,759
Proof you're a fraud.

220
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,998
And I'm going to show it to the world.

221
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,170
Well? Which of these boxes
do I click on for the proof?

222
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,472
None. He posted this video
the day before he died.

223
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:01,974
And we can't find whatever
proof he claimed to have had.

224
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,910
So that's why JD was tortured,

225
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,812
so the killer could find and destroy it?

226
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:08,381
Or he's a liar.

227
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:10,316
Huh?

228
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:11,684
I'm not sure who said that,

229
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:15,254
but I totally agree with them.

230
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,490
Bobby Lowe would never
do something like that.

231
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:19,025
- Why do you say that?
- Because,

232
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:21,387
Bobby's show is so personal.

233
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,634
It's so authentic.

234
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:24,037
There's no way that you could fake it.

235
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,381
Right. Don't listen to her.

236
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:26,583
The man is clearly a thief.

237
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:27,957
Let's go give him a good throttling.

238
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,427
I'm leaning towards just talking to him.

239
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:30,986
And then throttling. I
suppose a little foreplay

240
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:31,971
never hurt anyone.

241
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:33,039
Wait.

242
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,153
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. You guys are gonna

243
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:36,155
go talk to him, like,
right now this second?

244
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,660
Yeah. Why?

245
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:39,579
Maybe I should go with.

246
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:42,916
You know, to collect the evidence.

247
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,651
- Right. Well, if he's innocent...
- He's not innocent.

248
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,487
If he's innocent, then there won't

249
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:49,989
be any evidence to collect,

250
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:51,724
so probably better if you hang here.

251
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:54,683
Yeah. I-I see what you're saying there,

252
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:55,618
but...

253
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:57,562
I just think, to be safe,

254
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,704
I should collect as
much stuff as possible.

255
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:02,134
You know, fingerprints, a
lock of hair, an autograph.

256
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,436
Right.

257
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:05,538
To be safe.

258
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,110
Okay.

259
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:08,746
To be safe.

260
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,227
Yeah!

261
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,470
Hey.

262
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:25,625
Hey.

263
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:26,926
Yeah.

264
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,628
Thanks for meeting me, Amenadiel.

265
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,963
Is there a shorter version of that?

266
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,366
Does anyone ever call you "Amen"?

267
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:35,709
Probably not.

268
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:36,999
Oh, you would be the first.

269
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,907
So, Linda, what's going on?

270
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,484
Um, I just wanted to say thank you.

271
00:10:45,794 --> 00:10:47,560
For saving my life.

272
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,196
Maze is the one who saved your life.

273
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,497
And I thanked her so much,

274
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,067
I think she's avoiding me now.

275
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,389
But I wouldn't be here without you, too.

276
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:59,692
I didn't do anything.

277
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:02,061
Other than miraculously
slowing down time

278
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:03,796
so that I didn't bleed to death?

279
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:05,965
Well, other than that.

280
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,066
How are you really doing, by the way?

281
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,570
I'm fine.

282
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:15,929
You have your powers back.

283
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:17,376
That must be exciting.

284
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:21,514
Mm. Um, not exactly.

285
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,082
They haven't worked since that day.

286
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:25,618
I'm sorry to hear that.

287
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,801
Ah, don't be.

288
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:29,689
I think it's just my
Father testing me again.

289
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:31,716
But this time, Linda, I'm ready.

290
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,386
How is He testing you?

291
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,269
Do you have to fight someone?

292
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:39,265
Solve advanced math problems?

293
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:44,064
Well, if I'm right, there's
something I need to do

294
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,938
in the penthouse and, uh...

295
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:49,342
I've been avoiding it.

296
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:52,979
Well, you helped me.

297
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:56,415
Why don't you let me help you with...

298
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,384
whatever this is?

299
00:11:58,386 --> 00:11:59,618
Unless it's math.

300
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,220
Oh, it's not math.

301
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:03,274
Then I'm sure I can handle it.

302
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,265
Oh. Severed angel wings in a closet.

303
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:14,500
Of course.

304
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,635
Totally handleable.

305
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:18,904
My irresponsible brother left them here

306
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,507
for any half-drunk
human to stumble onto.

307
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:26,151
Proof of the divine just
left on the floor like...

308
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:29,389
like used laundry.

309
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:33,786
For some reason, I imagined they just

310
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:35,888
magically disappeared
when he cut them off.

311
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,923
But this...

312
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,828
yeah, this is gruesome.

313
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:41,063
Mm-hmm.

314
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:43,000
You know where the garbage bags are?

315
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,170
Hi, Lieutenant.

316
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:52,972
I just wanted to come by and talk.

317
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:54,862
Kind of feel like we got
off on the wrong foot.

318
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:57,911
Pretty sure we're on exactly
the foot I want to be on.

319
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,747
I'm not a bad guy.

320
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,250
And I'm not a dirty cop.

321
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,087
So, you didn't check
a gun out of evidence

322
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:09,655
that was used to commit a crime?

323
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:13,060
I mean, yes.

324
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:15,242
At least it wasn't a homicide, right?

325
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,863
Well, it, um...

326
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,699
- I-I was... I just...
- Stop.

327
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:22,168
I was gonna string this along,

328
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,804
but it's already a
little too sad for me.

329
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:26,972
I'm actually glad you came in.

330
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,685
Really?

331
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:32,333
I want all the intel that
you gathered on Lucifer.

332
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:34,947
Why would I have any intel on Lucifer?

333
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:36,715
Because when he first
started working with Decker,

334
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,284
you were still married to her.

335
00:13:38,286 --> 00:13:40,068
And I'm guessing you broke the rules

336
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,959
and dug up everything you could on him.

337
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:45,820
I didn't. I mean...

338
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:49,628
Yeah. I did.

339
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,065
I'd like it all on my desk in an hour.

340
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,803
That's the biggest cock I've ever seen.

341
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,842
Oh, whoa, whoa, excuse me, guys.

342
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:04,710
- You guys can't be back here.
- We're looking for...

343
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:06,145
Bobby Lowe!

344
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:07,847
Uh, right.

345
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:09,261
Oh, my God, please, no.

346
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:10,997
He doesn't like visitors.

347
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,433
Damn, I can't get fired.

348
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,621
Oh, my God, it's really Bobby Lowe.

349
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,790
What did I say?

350
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,725
- I'm sorry.
- No eye contact,

351
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,274
no green Skittles in my candy jar

352
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:23,977
and no guests!

353
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,532
I'm Detective Chloe Decker, LAPD.

354
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:29,552
We want to talk to you about
the murder of JD Woodstock.

355
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:30,788
Why are you stopping?

356
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,105
Show starts in five
minutes, honey. Chop-chop.

357
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:35,207
God, he just called her honey. So sweet.

358
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,109
Is this about that stupid podcast?

359
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:39,499
You really think I stole jokes? Me?

360
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:40,866
- Very much so, yes.
- Of course not.

361
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:42,915
What I think is I'd like

362
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,316
to explore his accusations,

363
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,985
starting with where
you were when he died.

364
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:47,753
You know why people

365
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,588
accuse others of stealing material?

366
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,823
Because the others are thieves?

367
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:52,658
Because they're failures.

368
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,959
And instead of facing that,

369
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,362
they blame successful people like me.

370
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:58,107
- How dare you...
- Uh...

371
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,865
They're ready for you, Bobby.

372
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:03,698
Look, some of us have
important work to do,

373
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,901
like entertaining America.

374
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,637
If you'd like to see how it's done,

375
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,074
take a seat.

376
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,141
Charming.

377
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:14,644
I can't believe it.

378
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:18,181
He invited us to a taping.

379
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,136
Are you ready to laugh?

380
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,183
Wait, what, what?

381
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:24,219
No, I can't hear you guys.

382
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:25,021
Come on.

383
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:26,607
I bribed you with T-shirts.

384
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,334
I phoned in all my best jokes.

385
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:29,525
What more do you want?

386
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:30,626
Oh, yeah.

387
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:32,528
More T-shirts!

388
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,330
- Yeah!
- Let's try that again.

389
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,466
Look what I got.

390
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,900
Are you ready to laugh?

391
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:39,902
- Yeah!
- All right, guys.

392
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:41,370
Let's start the show.

393
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,173
Yeah!

394
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,775
Oh, there he is, there he is.

395
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:57,520
Well, that was the worst
date of my entire life.

396
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,555
Oh, come on now, Bobby.

397
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:02,281
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

398
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:03,938
She left before we got dessert.

399
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:06,863
But dessert's the best
part of the meal, Bobby.

400
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,434
Well, on the upside, you have
been trying to lose weight.

401
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,204
I didn't say I left before dessert.

402
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:18,556
This is what that arrogant
fraud is so proud of?

403
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,625
Wait, what's this show about?

404
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:21,928
Oh. Those are his

405
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:23,212
imaginary friends.

406
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,414
They help him deal
with his insecurities.

407
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,183
- Oh.
- We've all been there, right?

408
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:29,224
- I'll just impress her at the party.
- Right.

409
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:30,520
Excuse me.

410
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,721
Excuse me.

411
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:32,778
Time out.

412
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:33,956
Excuse me.

413
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,057
Sorry.

414
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,626
You stole a dead man's work

415
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,330
and turned it into this?

416
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,854
Get lost, Fraggle Rock.

417
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:41,531
What do you think you're doing, man?

418
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,638
Stealing your show,

419
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:44,599
which only seems fair
as you stole it first.

420
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:47,260
Hey, mind your own business, Dr. Who.

421
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:48,604
Pip pip out of here.

422
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:49,790
Dr. Who?

423
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,908
Don't laugh.

424
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,111
Oh, geez.

425
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:56,979
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

426
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:58,506
Right, what have you
got to say for yourself?

427
00:16:58,508 --> 00:16:59,477
Beat it, handy.

428
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,962
I'm not talking to you. Get
the hell out of my set, man.

429
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:04,002
Okay. Okay, fine. Don't talk to me.

430
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,173
Let's have a chat with one
of your old friends, shall we?

431
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:07,590
- What have we got in here?
- You can't touch those puppets.

432
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:09,058
Does anyone work here?!

433
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,093
Ah, here we go. All
right, this one looks good.

434
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:12,528
No, no, n-no, put-put that...

435
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,813
- put that down.
- What? What?

436
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:18,067
Jealous someone else has
their hand up my butt?

437
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,051
Actually, this apparatus
is more difficult than...

438
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:23,172
- Seriously, put it down.
- Ah, there's the trigger.

439
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:24,974
Right. Where was I? You...

440
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:30,413
I'm telling you, just
get down, get down.

441
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,991
Oh, don't worry, everyone.

442
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:35,108
There's just a gun
stashed inside the puppet.

443
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:37,520
- Lucifer, put the gun down.
- Right.

444
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:39,155
Right. Yes.

445
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,273
Well, at least no one was hurt.

446
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,718
Uh... he did it.

447
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:55,887
Are you insane? You could've killed him.

448
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,348
Me? I'm not the one who hid
a gun up a puppet's backside.

449
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:01,020
Or have all the puppets
got guns in them?

450
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:02,223
If so, I'll set my DVR.

451
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:04,426
No. We never used that puppet.

452
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,430
It was my imaginary
friend's imaginary friend.

453
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,527
The character didn't land.

454
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,361
- I wonder why.
- So you hid a gun in it?

455
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:10,676
I didn't think some lunatic

456
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:11,846
was gonna try to kill me with it.

457
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:13,147
It's just a flesh wound.

458
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,788
And you admit that it's your gun?

459
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,881
Yeah.

460
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,383
Ah, I see.

461
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,526
So you killed our poor
victim, ran back to work

462
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:21,195
and keistered it in an old puppet.

463
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,529
Not the murder weapon.

464
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:25,933
This is a 380, and the
murderer used a 9mm.

465
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:28,535
All that means is that he hid
his other gun somewhere else.

466
00:18:28,537 --> 00:18:30,904
So come on. Prostate
exams for all the puppets.

467
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:33,974
- Lucifer...
- I don't have another gun.

468
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:36,110
I didn't kill JD.

469
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:38,445
I don't believe you. You're a thief.

470
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:40,547
You took everything
JD had, even his life.

471
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:43,785
So come on, what more
could you possibly desire?

472
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:48,556
I want out of this hell.

473
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:54,690
Every day I come to work, and I
tell stupid jokes with puppets.

474
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:56,093
Puppets!

475
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,416
Bobby.

476
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:58,485
What are you saying?

477
00:18:58,488 --> 00:18:59,620
This is a dream gig.

478
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:01,068
It's a nightmare!

479
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,850
You know what the biggest joke is?

480
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:05,639
- You?
- Me!

481
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:08,444
It's no fun when they
talk to themselves.

482
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,979
And now that JD's dead, I'm
never getting out of here.

483
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:13,714
What do you mean?

484
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,760
He was telling the truth.

485
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,257
I stole his act.

486
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:25,393
I based the show on it.

487
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:30,164
But I defended you!

488
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,515
J'accuse, Bobby Lowe!

489
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:33,902
J'accuse!

490
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,149
If you wanted out of the job so bad,

491
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:39,109
why didn't you just admit it and quit?

492
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,413
Golden handcuffs.

493
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,916
If I quit, I lose all the money.

494
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,787
And I really like the money.

495
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,257
And if JD revealed
that you were stealing

496
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,692
his act, and they fire you...

497
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:53,085
I get a golden parachute instead.

498
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:55,422
Which is why I had to
keep up appearances,

499
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:57,142
not let anyone know the truth.

500
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:59,135
- But why hide the gun on set?
- Yeah.

501
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:00,771
Because I was getting death threats.

502
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:04,135
Someone's pissed, claiming
all my jokes are about him.

503
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:07,271
The jokes that you stole
like the thief which you are?

504
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,436
That's a big strong, Miss Lopez.

505
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:12,072
Yeah.

506
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:14,781
Any idea who was making these threats?

507
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:17,185
They came from an anonymous e-mail.

508
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:19,588
But like I said, I stole the jokes.

509
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:21,964
The only person who
knows who they're about...

510
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,000
Is the dead guy. Great.

511
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:26,035
I'm gonna need those e-mails.

512
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:28,771
All right.

513
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:37,346
God.

514
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:40,550
This must be so painful.

515
00:20:40,552 --> 00:20:44,093
Cutting off a piece of
yourself over and over.

516
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:49,959
Lucifer made it seem
like no big deal, but...

517
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,524
ouch.

518
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:53,796
We all have pain that we hide, Linda,

519
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:56,800
that we're just not ready
to share with the world.

520
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,883
That's very true.

521
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:05,775
How do you know it's a test?

522
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:09,145
Because I'm faced with having
to dispose of the one thing

523
00:21:09,147 --> 00:21:11,080
that I so desperately want back.

524
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:13,900
Could just be really bad luck. No.

525
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:16,070
My Father always has a plan.

526
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:18,308
I don't doubt that anymore.

527
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:22,658
Seems awfully cruel.

528
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,528
Well, if it were easy, it
wouldn't be much of a test.

529
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,697
Would it?

530
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:36,539
"I know what you're doing.
Stop making fun of me,

531
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,808
or else I'm going to stab you."

532
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,910
"I know you're making fun of me.

533
00:21:40,912 --> 00:21:42,757
Stop or I'll kill you."

534
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,493
Dreadfully unoriginal, aren't they?

535
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:46,482
Looks like the threats stopped last week

536
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:49,018
after JD posted his video.

537
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
So you think the killer
saw it and then realized

538
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:53,356
he'd been threatening the
wrong comedian the entire time?

539
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:55,494
And then killed JD after he realized

540
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:57,430
he was the guy actually
making fun of him.

541
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:58,866
Seems possible.

542
00:21:58,869 --> 00:21:59,795
So...

543
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:01,430
what's the joke that
he's so angry about?

544
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:03,866
Did our killer have
unfunny imaginary friends?

545
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:06,269
No, that happened later.

546
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:08,801
I did some research, and originally,

547
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:11,673
- the show was much edgier.
- Hmm?

548
00:22:11,676 --> 00:22:15,845
About a guy dealing with his
insecurities about his, um...

549
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:19,015
W-Well, I really don't want to tell you.

550
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:20,903
Ooh. Well, now I need to know.

551
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:27,144
Dealing with his insecurities
about his, um, micropenis.

552
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,127
All right, well.

553
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:32,962
Hold me closer, tiny donger.

554
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:35,172
So you're saying we're looking
for a needle in a penis stack.

555
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:37,433
See, this is why I
didn't want to tell you.

556
00:22:37,435 --> 00:22:39,302
- Anyhow, after it became a family show...
- Mm.

557
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:40,736
The micropenis got removed.

558
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:42,238
Did anyone even notice?

559
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,806
Okay.

560
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,207
Okay.

561
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:47,243
Just go to town.

562
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,245
Get them all out of your system.

563
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:54,050
What?

564
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:56,118
Well, perhaps...

565
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,669
perhaps we should
consider this case closed.

566
00:22:58,672 --> 00:22:59,922
Excuse me?

567
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:01,924
Well, we thought Bobby stole a joke,

568
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:05,271
but in actual fact, our deceased
stole this man's very essence.

569
00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:07,462
I mean, his tiny,
microscopic essence, sure,

570
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:09,000
but his essence nonetheless.

571
00:23:09,003 --> 00:23:10,566
So, uh, in actual fact,

572
00:23:10,568 --> 00:23:12,234
I think our killer is the victim here.

573
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:14,704
Yeah, that's actually not how it works.

574
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:16,521
We still need to find our killer.

575
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:19,926
I'll get these to cyber,
see if they can trace an I.P.

576
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:27,660
What? No.

577
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:29,805
Not "cinnamon," "Sinnerman."

578
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,620
He's not a spice, Maze.

579
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:35,024
Well, yes, I know you
have a hectic schedule,

580
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:38,407
but surely you can find time
to track him down for me.

581
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,762
Right. Stop pretending the
call is cutting out, Maze.

582
00:23:40,765 --> 00:23:42,331
I taught you that trick.

583
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,966
Maze.

584
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:46,769
Mazikeen!

585
00:23:56,514 --> 00:23:58,547
Lucifer Morningstar.

586
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:01,683
I've figured out what you really are.

587
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,071
So, it's come to this, has it?

588
00:24:14,074 --> 00:24:16,885
Finally, someone in the police
department realized that I am

589
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:19,845
exactly what I say I
am: the Devil himself.

590
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:22,724
Well, I'm surprised
it's taken you this long.

591
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:23,992
I have no idea why you prance around

592
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:25,127
and call yourself the Devil.

593
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,261
"Prance"?

594
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:28,997
This is about the Sinnerman.

595
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,399
Right.

596
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:31,733
I see what's happening here.

597
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:34,136
A mysterious figure handing out favors,

598
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:35,370
probably dashing and handsome.

599
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:37,072
You think I'm the Sinnerman.

600
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:38,447
Well, truth is...

601
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,210
You're not the Sinnerman...
He's smart and calculated.

602
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:42,678
You don't know me.

603
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,380
Maybe I am the Sinnerman. Surprise!

604
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:48,585
No, I followed you and
looked into your history.

605
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:50,652
You're impulsive and short-fused.

606
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:52,322
I am not.

607
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:57,059
Very well.

608
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,994
What is it that you think I am?

609
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:00,160
An idiot.

610
00:25:01,632 --> 00:25:03,732
So what, you broke into my
apartment just to insult me?

611
00:25:03,734 --> 00:25:05,723
You could've just waited
till I was in the office.

612
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:07,669
No, I came here to warn you.

613
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:09,738
I know you're looking into him,

614
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,875
but you have no idea what you're doing.

615
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:14,510
The Sinnerman is not a myth.

616
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,278
Very aware of that already, thank you.

617
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,180
It's not a name to throw around.

618
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:19,581
Not even at the precinct.

619
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,450
That's why I came here to talk.

620
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:22,951
He's that dangerous.

621
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:24,586
So am I.

622
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:25,921
Maybe so.

623
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:28,937
Either way, you need to
know who you're dealing with.

624
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,426
I've butted heads with him in Chicago.

625
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:33,061
Did not end well.

626
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:35,664
Then, what? You ran here with
your tail between your legs?

627
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:36,899
I did, yeah.

628
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:38,333
Oh.

629
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:43,205
He killed someone... close to me.

630
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,140
Really damn close.

631
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:48,307
I don't want what happened to
me to happen to anyone else.

632
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,245
Even you.

633
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:51,880
You need to be careful.

634
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:54,616
He stole from me, Lieutenant,
and I won't stand for it.

635
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:56,718
- You're not listening.
- Yes, I am.

636
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,153
Now you listen to me.

637
00:25:58,155 --> 00:26:01,390
You can keep your head buried
in the sand if you want to,

638
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:05,294
while I go mano a Sinnermano, all right?

639
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:06,810
I've got this.

640
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:16,605
So...

641
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:17,673
Compost?

642
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:20,342
Recycling?

643
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:24,647
I've never had to dispose
of pieces of divinity before.

644
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:29,686
Waste.

645
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:41,779
I thought this would be a
little more... reverential?

646
00:26:41,782 --> 00:26:44,334
Less angel wing dumpster fire.

647
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:48,604
Should we say something?

648
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,472
I feel like we should say something...

649
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,474
What do you want me to say here, Linda?

650
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:54,479
I didn't choose this test.

651
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:57,679
I don't even know if
this really is a test.

652
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:00,560
I mean, maybe I'm just
torturing myself here.

653
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,159
But if Lucifer wants to
treat his wings like trash,

654
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:09,066
then trash they shall
be. Even if it pains me

655
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,325
in my very soul.

656
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:13,729
I don't think Lucifer knows
how much this hurts you.

657
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:15,764
He never does.

658
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,774
And even though he doesn't realize it,

659
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:21,937
everything he does seems
designed to hurt me.

660
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,607
To test you?

661
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:28,911
Huh. Wow.

662
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:33,081
You're right.

663
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:37,285
It's been right in front
of my face all along.

664
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:39,121
My test is Lucifer.

665
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,790
It's always been Lucifer.

666
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:46,661
You're very wise, Linda.

667
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,196
Thanks, Amen.

668
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:50,799
- Mm...
- Yeah, it doesn't work, does it?

669
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:08,161
I, uh, had a rather
illuminating conversation

670
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:09,697
with our new lieutenant last night.

671
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,199
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

672
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:13,722
Yet. He warned me not to
talk about the Sinnerman.

673
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:14,856
Yeah, he's right.

674
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:16,428
You sound crazy... er.

675
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,726
No. He actually knows...

676
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:20,128
Cyber tracked all the e-mails
to the same I.P. address.

677
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,331
A comedy club on Sunset
called The Laughmaker.

678
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,019
So do we think he works there?

679
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,581
Maybe. The e-mails were always sent

680
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,051
- Thursday nights at 8:00 p.m.
- And that's when

681
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,235
Bobby's show aired. So it makes sense

682
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:29,670
that that could set him off.

683
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:30,932
Yeah, it's also when
they have open mic night,

684
00:28:30,934 --> 00:28:33,322
so it could be any one of
the comedians performing, too.

685
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:34,691
Or a diehard fan.

686
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:36,068
Either way, they're consistent.

687
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:37,283
It would make sense that the killer

688
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:38,623
could be at the next open mic night.

689
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:39,858
Which is tonight.

690
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:41,627
- So how do we draw him out?
- Easy.

691
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,729
Arrest everyone in the club
and pull their pants down.

692
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:45,264
Tiniest weenie wins, for once.

693
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,748
Or, our guy is clearly sensitive, right?

694
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:49,234
Why don't we use that to flush him out?

695
00:28:49,236 --> 00:28:51,537
What, get someone on stage
that'll really piss him off?

696
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,118
Yeah. Yeah, that could work.

697
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:55,641
And I think we all know the
perfect man for that job.

698
00:28:57,244 --> 00:28:58,677
All right,

699
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,740
please welcome to the
stage, for the first time,

700
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:04,144
the devilishly handsome...

701
00:29:04,147 --> 00:29:07,053
Dan Espinoza.

702
00:29:12,142 --> 00:29:14,876
Remember "yes, and," Daniel.

703
00:29:23,215 --> 00:29:25,115
Hi, everybody.

704
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:27,456
- Hey.
- Hi.

705
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,047
So, uh...

706
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,266
Um...

707
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:33,068
Oh...

708
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,770
Uh, I have a friend.

709
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:38,158
And... he's got a tiny penis.

710
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:39,875
- What?
- Uh...

711
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:41,376
a micropenis.

712
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,512
Uh, in fact,

713
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:45,547
his penis is so tiny,

714
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:48,150
it's not even a micropenis.

715
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:49,751
It's an atomic penis.

716
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,768
Because atoms are small.

717
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:56,358
Not because it ex... plodes.

718
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:01,319
- His, uh, penis is so small...
- Boo!

719
00:30:01,322 --> 00:30:03,565
It's a medical condition, you monster.

720
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:09,671
- Lucifer... What?
- Can't stop, won't stop.

721
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:11,173
This is much too fun, Detective.

722
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:13,041
No, no, no, keep going.
I want you to keep going.

723
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:14,309
Copy that.

724
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:15,677
Anyways... So what?

725
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,658
Next you're gonna tell
us that his willy's

726
00:30:17,661 --> 00:30:19,381
so small that when he wants to have sex,

727
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:21,306
he needs to call out a search party?

728
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:24,019
Or that his weenis is so small,

729
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:25,721
it looks like his testicles are giving

730
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,322
the tiniest thumbs up?

731
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:28,357
Huh?

732
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,558
Shame on you

733
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
for mocking the poorly-endowed.

734
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:33,580
- Yeah!
- Oh, hold on.

735
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,129
Maybe there's no friend at all,

736
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:37,199
and you're the one with the baby carrot.

737
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:38,900
What? No.

738
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:41,198
No, I-I... I-I don't have a micropenis.

739
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:43,068
I mean, not that there's
anything wrong with having one.

740
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,506
Come on. Now's your chance.

741
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:46,508
Show the world your teeny,
tiny, itsy-bitsy baby arm.

742
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,343
I-I... I don't have a tiny, teeny...

743
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:49,531
It's okay!

744
00:30:49,534 --> 00:30:51,546
We accept you for
your miniscule manhood.

745
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:54,549
I don't have a tiny...

746
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,118
- Oh, my...
- Lucifer.

747
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,185
What, you didn't bring any?

748
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:59,321
Get off.

749
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:01,423
Or show us your nubbin. Hmm?

750
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:03,659
- Yeah!
- Yeah. Boo!

751
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:06,929
There you go!

752
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:11,099
Oh, lovely.

753
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:12,501
What the hell was that, man?

754
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,569
You undermined the entire sting.

755
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:15,971
Well, I'd argue you undermined it

756
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:17,706
with your botched attempt at humor.

757
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,708
All I did was throw a
drowning man a tomato.

758
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,243
Oh, what are the chances?

759
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:23,278
I didn't even want to
do this to begin with.

760
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,882
And I told you stand-up and
improv are completely different.

761
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:28,417
And why didn't you stop him?

762
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,885
Because I realized the killer

763
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,820
might seek out a sympathetic voice.

764
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,022
He wasn't sympathetic.

765
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,423
He just used it as an excuse

766
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,892
to tell even more micropenis jokes.

767
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,361
There is no way anyone's
gonna appreciate that.

768
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:40,629
Hey, man.

769
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:42,564
I just, uh, wanted to say...

770
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,435
really appreciate you
saying what you did.

771
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:46,535
- Huh.
- Ah.

772
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,704
Absolutely. No problem at all.

773
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,239
I mean, someone has to stand up
for the little guy, am I right?

774
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,407
Yeah.

775
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,676
Hearing stuff like that just...

776
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:56,111
makes you want to murder someone,

777
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:57,245
doesn't it?

778
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:59,514
- Sure does.
- Hmm.

779
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:02,292
Well done, Detective.
Right, just to be sure,

780
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,352
shall I pull his pants down,
or do you want the honors?

781
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:06,888
You're gonna do what?

782
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,956
- Follow me.
- What?

783
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,391
- Come on.
- I...

784
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,896
I don't understand.

785
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:16,998
Having a micropenis isn't a crime.

786
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,835
So you didn't send threatening
e-mails to Bobby Lowe?

787
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,770
No, I did.

788
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:24,443
Back when Bobby was
nobody, I toured with him.

789
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:26,385
And that's when I figured
he heard about my...

790
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:27,653
condition.

791
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:31,324
Um, how would he have heard about that?

792
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:32,771
All the chuckle bunnies talk.

793
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:33,782
The what?

794
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:36,384
Uh... chicks who like to
have sex with comedians.

795
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:37,686
Oh, there's a term for that?

796
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:39,387
Oh, I should get a term.

797
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:41,022
- Oh.
- Devil bunnies.

798
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:42,451
Oh, no. Lucifans.

799
00:32:42,454 --> 00:32:44,120
- Can you please...?
- Or not.

800
00:32:44,123 --> 00:32:45,956
One in particular, I told some stories,

801
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:48,509
and then, I heard them
as part of Bobby's set.

802
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:49,845
So then, you started threatening him.

803
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:51,813
I was blowing off steam, okay?

804
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:53,404
Every time that stupid show aired,

805
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:55,274
it was like a punch in the gut.

806
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:57,606
And then you found out that
JD was writing the jokes.

807
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,307
And justifiably murdered him.

808
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:01,043
I forgave him.

809
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,038
What?

810
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,579
But he stole your life
story and profited from it.

811
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,047
Why would you forgive him?

812
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:09,191
I don't mind a fellow
struggling comic busting balls.

813
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:12,082
It's when a millionaire starts
punching down that I get pissed.

814
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:14,756
Or that good-looking jerk from the club.

815
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:16,549
- What? Who's he talking about?
- Oh.

816
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:18,518
- Dan.
- Oh. Right.

817
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:20,395
Are you sure?

818
00:33:20,397 --> 00:33:23,165
Besides, JD's life was pretty sad.

819
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,267
I mean, I think his
last gig was a barbecue.

820
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,670
He even made up this sad story
about a warm-up comic wanting

821
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:30,238
to meet with him about a gig.

822
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,307
- As if that'd happen.
- Why?

823
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:35,452
Is telling bad jokes before
even worse jokes a coveted gig?

824
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:36,367
Are you kidding?

825
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,687
You work an hour a day
and clear six figures.

826
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,463
Not to mention, you probably get a role

827
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:41,598
in the show at some point.

828
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:43,118
- Oh.
- Really?

829
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,575
Do you remember the name of
the, uh, warm-up comedian?

830
00:33:46,578 --> 00:33:49,491
Uh, Shelly maybe, or...?

831
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,543
- Sheila?
- Yeah, that was it.

832
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:52,879
Do you know her?

833
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:54,682
We're done here.

834
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:58,431
What? Detective, what
did I miss? Who's Sheila?

835
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:00,935
Sheila's the name of Bobby
Lowe's warm-up comedian.

836
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,563
Right.

837
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:11,611
Detective, are you
sure that Sheila's here?

838
00:34:11,613 --> 00:34:16,483
Her roommate said that she'd be
here working on new jokes, so...

839
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:18,718
Well, I still don't understand.

840
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,488
She seemed devastated when
Bobby said he was a joke thief.

841
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,034
Well, maybe she's not
pissed off about the theft.

842
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:29,496
What? Well, then, what else
would she be angry about?

843
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:33,566
Let's find out.

844
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:35,435
Okay.

845
00:34:35,437 --> 00:34:39,006
As if these puppets
weren't creepy enough.

846
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,423
Hello?

847
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:55,390
Anyone here?

848
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:58,093
Hello?

849
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:04,989
Lucifer?

850
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,040
Hello, Detective.

851
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:14,843
Sorry.

852
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:18,213
Well, don't worry. At least
I don't have a gun up my bum.

853
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:20,315
If you're not gonna take this seriously,

854
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:22,217
then you wait here for me.

855
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:23,637
Okay.

856
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:36,465
Okay.

857
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,467
Hello?

858
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,603
Anyone here?

859
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,623
What, what's going on?

860
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:04,385
- Is she still here?
- Who? She? Sheila?

861
00:36:04,388 --> 00:36:05,894
Did she do this to you?

862
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:07,396
I told her I was gonna quit,

863
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,898
and-and she freaked out
on me, started screaming

864
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,433
about everything she-she'd done for me.

865
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,202
But I-I can't take it
any-anymore. My craft...

866
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:16,738
Okay, midlife crisis
later. How long ago?

867
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,307
Uh, a few minutes maybe.

868
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,375
We-we heard you come
in, and then she hit me

869
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:22,778
with the butt of her, of
her gun... in the face!

870
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,813
- She has a gun?
- Did-did you hear me?!

871
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,335
I said, in-in the face!
This is my moneymaker!

872
00:36:27,338 --> 00:36:30,285
- Am I okay?
- Lucifer, she's here!

873
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:31,888
- No.
- She's armed!

874
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:45,268
Why did you do it, Sheila?

875
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,283
Get out of the way!

876
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:50,502
I'm getting out of here.

877
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:51,839
Well, once you answer my question,

878
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:53,807
I'll gladly let you past.

879
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:58,113
Why kill and torture a man
for this pretentious hack?

880
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:01,750
Do you know how hard it is to
crawl out of the stand-up world

881
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,254
and get a gig like this?

882
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:05,335
But he's a fellow comedian.

883
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:07,155
Why would you kill for someone

884
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:09,124
who stole jokes from one of your own?

885
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,343
So he stole material.

886
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:13,695
Hell, he stole half my
set, too. Who cares?!

887
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:14,863
You should!

888
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,998
It's yours!

889
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,721
One might say your very identity.

890
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:22,104
Jokes don't make a comedian.

891
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,005
Everyone has an itchy butt joke.

892
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:25,741
It's all about what you do with it.

893
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,325
What you do with your itchy butt?

894
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,945
- With the joke!
- Oh.

895
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,447
So, what you're saying is,

896
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:34,716
it's okay to steal
someone's work as long

897
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:36,051
as you do it better?

898
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,478
And take me with you? Hell yeah, it is.

899
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:41,667
- Oh...
- Now, if you don't get out of my way...

900
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,226
I swear...

901
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,099
Excellent work, Detective.

902
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,733
Okay, so... how do we
get her down from here?

903
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,414
Daniel?

904
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,649
You're not gonna throw
atomato at me, are you?

905
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:09,217
Come now, Daniel.

906
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,753
I only did that for
the good of the case.

907
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:13,688
Also, I ran out, but more importantly,

908
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,290
did you text me to come here?

909
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,092
I didn't recognize the number,
so I assumed it was you.

910
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,527
You didn't save my number?

911
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,962
It was me.

912
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,360
Too much hard work to break
into my penthouse again

913
00:38:32,363 --> 00:38:33,696
for a heart-to-heart?

914
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:36,183
I did some digging, and you were right.

915
00:38:36,186 --> 00:38:37,704
The Sinnerman is here in L.A.

916
00:38:37,707 --> 00:38:39,350
Oh, right.

917
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:40,852
Are you not gonna take my advice

918
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:43,485
- from last night?
- Most definitely not.

919
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,021
I thought so.

920
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,947
You brought the Sinnerman's
murderous thug in.

921
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,496
He's all yours.

922
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,965
I couldn't get anything
out of him. Maybe you can.

923
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,315
Oh. Right.

924
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:01,036
So, what, is this you passing the baton?

925
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,938
- Where are you running off to next?
- Nowhere.

926
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,439
I'm seeing this through.

927
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:07,008
But you need to shut your
damn mouth about the Sinnerman.

928
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,844
We need to play this carefully.

929
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,531
Let's keep it between us.

930
00:39:10,534 --> 00:39:12,547
The less people who know about it,

931
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:13,982
the less chance anyone gets hurt.

932
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,384
- But the detective...
- Has a kid.

933
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:18,596
She stays out of it.

934
00:39:23,078 --> 00:39:24,261
Very well.

935
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,808
Hello, Alonso.

936
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,577
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

937
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:45,981
I know the Sinnerman had you
skewer Sam under the pier,

938
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,049
so tell me everything.

939
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:49,985
Who the hell's the Sinnerman?

940
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,256
Fine.

941
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,597
Fine. Let's play a
little game, shall we?

942
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,034
Look at me.

943
00:39:59,993 --> 00:40:01,626
Tell me.

944
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:05,567
Why did you really desire Sam's death?

945
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,272
I... didn't want my girl
to sleep with him anymore.

946
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:13,575
And?

947
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,478
And... that's it.

948
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,280
I got pissed.

949
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,749
Went medieval on his
ass to send a message.

950
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,884
No one touches my girl.

951
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:24,986
And what about the Sinnerman?

952
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:27,088
Man, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

953
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,957
Oh, you must know. Come on, Alonso.

954
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,659
What about the Sinnerman?

955
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,227
I don't know.

956
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,096
You must know!

957
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:38,253
I don't know anything... I swear.

958
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:45,925
I believe you.

959
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,213
He was telling the truth.

960
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:53,648
I mean, maybe

961
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,685
the Sinnerman manipulated
Alonso without him realizing it.

962
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,287
Or perhaps he was just a
deranged fellow who felt

963
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,024
impaling a rival lover to death
was the way to his girl's heart.

964
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:05,735
It's a bit old-fashioned, really.

965
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:10,279
Lucifer, I want to
talk about your wings.

966
00:41:10,282 --> 00:41:12,701
Oh, bloody hell. They're not out again?!

967
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,904
So they grew back?

968
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:18,592
They did... this morning.

969
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:20,141
Sneaky buggers.

970
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:23,374
- You can't keep doing this to yourself.
- Oh, I agree.

971
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:25,013
- You do?
- Yes.

972
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:28,836
It's getting exhausting...
and quite messy.

973
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:30,633
No, I need a new solution.

974
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:33,293
Maybe I should hire someone to do it.

975
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:36,191
Or maybe your solution is

976
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:39,961
to accept that, for now,
you have wings again.

977
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:43,905
What, and let Dad win,
or whoever it bloody is?

978
00:41:43,908 --> 00:41:45,901
I... I don't think so.

979
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:51,339
It's easy to let external
factors... define us.

980
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,810
Especially the traumatic ones.

981
00:41:57,124 --> 00:41:58,914
But only if we let them.

982
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,957
We all have itchy butts.

983
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,253
Excuse me?

984
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:06,888
No, it's just something
a woman said to me

985
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,598
right before I punched her in the face.

986
00:42:10,805 --> 00:42:12,939
It's not about the idea.
It's about the execution.

987
00:42:12,942 --> 00:42:14,796
It's about how I use the wings.

988
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,298
That's... actually...

989
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,100
pretty wise.

990
00:42:19,102 --> 00:42:20,568
Yeah. So I'll just tuck them away

991
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,570
- and pretend they don't exist.
- Less good.

992
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:25,399
Someone else is giving
favors. Who cares?

993
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:27,442
I'm Lucifer bloody Morningstar!

994
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,844
I do favors better than anyone else.

995
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:33,515
Amongst other things, of course.

996
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,858
Or at least, I used to.

997
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:38,229
And I think that maybe...

998
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,423
it's about time I got back in the game.

999
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:09,552
Hello.

1000
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,467
So, tell me.

1001
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,283
What is it that you truly desire?

1002
