1
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:18,076
This is nice,
that we all get to eat together.

2
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:18,893
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:20,078
Absolutely.

4
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:24,199
Hmm.

5
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,919
Can we maybe
put the phones down

6
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:29,888
and have an actual
human conversation?

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,089
We can,

8
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,707
but thanks
to Steve Jobs,

9
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:34,926
we don't have to.

10
00:00:35,928 --> 00:00:36,994
Guys, guys,

11
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,046
you're never gonna believe this.

12
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:40,381
What happened?
I just got a part on a TV show!

13
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:41,883
What? That's great!
Congratulations!

14
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:42,801
Guys!

15
00:00:42,803 --> 00:00:44,269
Oh, yeah!

16
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:45,220
Yay, Penny!

17
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:47,806
What's the show?

18
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:50,191
Um, NC...II...

19
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:52,944
or, you know, NCSTD...
I don't know,

20
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:55,280
it's-it's the one

21
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:56,898
with the letters and
I'm gonna be on it!

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,900
That's amazing.
Yeah.

23
00:00:58,902 --> 00:00:59,834
What's your part?

24
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:01,519
Um, I play a customer
in a diner

25
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:03,288
and I flirt
with Mark Harmon.

26
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,706
Ooh, Mark Harmon,

27
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,658
he's a dreamboat.

28
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,377
So i-it's just flirting?

29
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,528
Well, yeah. Why?

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,546
Uh, no reason.

31
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:12,547
I just think it's sexier

32
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:14,110
when things are left
to the imagination.

33
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,137

44
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:51,353
So I-I read a study that
says a man with a dog

45
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,905
is three times more likely
to get a woman's phone number.

46
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:56,007
Is it true even when
the man lets his dog

47
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,543
lick peanut butter
off his tongue?

48
00:01:58,545 --> 00:02:00,946
I don't see why not.

49
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,682
If you're really
desperate to meet women

50
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:05,784
and like having food
eaten out of your mouth,

51
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:07,986
I could set you up
with my mom.

52
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:09,320
(all but Sheldon laughing)

53
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:11,322
Why is that funny?

54
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,576
That's just unhygienic.

55
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:16,545
It's a joke.

56
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:18,380
I don't think so.

57
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:20,766
I believe that a joke

58
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:22,350
is a brief oral narrative

59
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,553
with a climactic
humorous twist.

60
00:02:24,555 --> 00:02:27,556
For example, uh,
Wolowitz's mother is so fat

61
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:29,775
that she decided
to go on a diet...

62
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:33,011
or exercise, or both.

63
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:36,648
See?

64
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,985
The twist is that people
don't usually change.

65
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:41,153
(laughs)

66
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,208
Well, they don't.

67
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,659
Hey, guys, don't forget,

68
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:49,461
my episode's on TV
tomorrow night.

69
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:50,796
We'll be there.
Can we bring anything?

70
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:51,830
Oh, that's so sweet of you,

71
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:53,381
but I was gonna steal food
from here.

72
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:56,551
You know... my treat.

73
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:58,503
Wait, if Howard's
mother is coming,

74
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:00,538
then you should
also steal marbles.

75
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,474
(laughs)

76
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:06,428
Because she's obese,

77
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,813
and hippos are obese,

78
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:09,848
and in the popular board game
"Hungry Hungry Hippos,"

79
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,683
they eat marbles.

80
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,074
Maybe I need to dumb
these down for you.

81
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:23,728
Leonard, do you
think I'm funny?

82
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,913
No.

83
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,951
Do you?

84
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:32,170
I think I'm hysterical.

85
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:34,789
I take it back.

86
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,876
That was funny.

87
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:39,928
The philosopher
Henri Bergson

88
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,246
says it's funny

89
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:44,266
when a human being
behaves like an object.

90
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:46,918
I bet that bit killed
at The Chuckle Hut.

91
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:50,939
Oh, he didn't perform
stand-up comedy,

92
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:53,141
he was a philosopher.

93
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:56,811
You know, I think
we're zeroing in on your problem.

94
00:03:58,397 --> 00:04:00,615
Perhaps I'll
spend some time

95
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,984
developing a unified
theory of comedy,

96
00:04:02,986 --> 00:04:05,403
which will allow me
to elicit laughter

97
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:06,821
from anyone
at any time.

98
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:08,406
Unless they're German,

99
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:11,243
'cause that's a tough crowd.

100
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:14,829
Are you set on people
laughing <i>with</i> you?

101
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,132
'Cause if you're
cool with <i>at</i> you...

102
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:26,007
I don't get it.

103
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,010
Raj, when you said you
were gonna bring a date

104
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:30,145
to watch Penny's
thing tonight,

105
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:31,680
I didn't think
you meant Stuart.

106
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,100
Really?

107
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:36,467
I never for a second

108
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:38,970
thought it'd be
anything else.

109
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:41,690
I almost met someone
last night, but I blew it.

110
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,491
I was walking Cinnamon

111
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:45,076
and this girl
introduced herself,

112
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:47,195
but she was so cute I panicked

113
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:48,947
and said,
"Wouldn't it be easier

114
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,783
if instead of talking we could
just sniff each other's butts?"

115
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,754
Well, Stuart's cute
in his own way.

116
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:56,922
When I was a baby,

117
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:59,124
my mother called me
her little possum.

118
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:00,959
Are possums cute?

119
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:02,994
Not at all.

120
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,380
If you're so intimidated

121
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:07,165
by talking to
attractive girls,

122
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,550
maybe you should practice

123
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:09,935
by talking to
regular people.

124
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:12,971
You mean like fatties and uggos?

125
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:16,441
Or maybe just stop talking.

126
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:18,026
I'm serious.

127
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:20,145
Go to the mall,
talk to anybody,

128
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,229
practice-- that way,

129
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:22,897
when you eventually do
talk to a cute girl,

130
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:24,032
it won't be so scary.

131
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:26,568
Or just keep dating the possum.

132
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:32,958
TONY (on TV): Parsa doesn't have
those kind of resources.

133
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,860
McGEE: No, and that's why he had
Erin Pace rewire it...

134
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:37,078
I'm so proud of you.

135
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,438
We haven't even
gotten to my scene yet.

136
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,205
I know,
but you're going to be a TV star

137
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,559
and you haven't left me yet.
That takes guts.

138
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,021
I don't know about you,

139
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:47,672
but I'm very
uncomfortable with all this.

140
00:05:47,674 --> 00:05:50,942
Why?
I've never seen this show before

141
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:53,711
and now I'm starting
with episode 246?

142
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:57,732
It's unnatural.

143
00:05:57,734 --> 00:06:01,386
Just think of the first 245
as the prequel.

144
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,155
All right.

145
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,225
Okay, shh.
Guys, guys, this is it.

146
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:09,611
I guess it's you and me, kid.

147
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:11,279
What are you doing?

148
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:12,897
I'm trying to make peace.

149
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:13,999
We're good.
Good.

150
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,834
Really? Because...
Are you kidding me?

151
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:17,068
(TV shuts off)
What's wrong?

152
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,920
Well... the diner scene.

153
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:20,538
Where's my diner scene?

154
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,589
Well, don't ask me.

155
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,242
Until I see the prequel,
I'm lost.

156
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:25,794
No, there was supposed
to be a big scene

157
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:26,761
with me and Mark Harmon,

158
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,713
but i-it's... gone.

159
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:29,848
What happened?

160
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,050
They must've cut it.

161
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:34,219
Oh, Penny...

162
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:36,721
I'm... I'm sorry.

163
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:38,390
That stinks.
I'm sure you were great.

164
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:39,858
This doesn't make any sense.

165
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,026
I mean, I...

166
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:43,478
I thought I did a...
a really good job, I...

167
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:47,916
Excuse me.

168
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:55,490
I've been studying how
to make people laugh.

169
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,295
They say that comedy

170
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:02,497
is tragedy plus time.

171
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,834
Let's tickle some ribs.

172
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,456
No, Dad,

173
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,591
I don't think they
cut me out of the show

174
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:15,593
because I was too pretty.

175
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,013
No, I don't need
you to come out

176
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:21,783
and kick Mark Harmon's ass.

177
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,686
Daddy, I gotta go.

178
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,287
I love you. Bye.

179
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:28,106
How you doing?

180
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:30,641
Ugh, this is
such a disaster.

181
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:33,144
My parents had all
my relatives over.

182
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:35,330
They got one of those
six-foot sandwiches,

183
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:39,200
and got my brother
a day pass out of rehab and...

184
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,669
...now he's missing

185
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:44,255
and the sandwich
is missing, and...

186
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:45,840
They're probably
in Mexico by now.

187
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:48,426
So humiliating.

188
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:50,178
You still got the part.

189
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,180
That's a huge
accomplishment.

190
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:53,664
Yeah, but this was
supposed to be my break, okay?

191
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,849
People were gonna
see me in this show

192
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:56,000
and it was gonna
lead to bigger things.

193
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:57,385
More auditions,
more parts...

194
00:07:57,387 --> 00:07:59,504
Now none of that's
gonna happen.

195
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:00,638
Honey, you only had,
like, three lines.

196
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,006
That wasn't gonna
happen anyway.

197
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,563
Unbelievable.
Oh...

198
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:10,732
Come on... no,
that's not what I meant.

199
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:11,983
Then what did you mean?
I don't...

200
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:13,151
Look, you know, words don't

201
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:15,370
always have to mean things.

202
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,038
I think you meant

203
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,406
that you don't believe in me.
Nope.

204
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:21,459
Uh-uh... I might not
know what I-I meant,

205
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:23,378
but I know that
I didn't mean that.

206
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,663
Not this guy.
Oh, no way.

207
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:27,315
I want you, right now,

208
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,584
to give me your 100% honest opinion.
Right.

209
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:31,636
Do you think I have
what it takes

210
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:33,371
to really make it
as an actress?

211
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:35,256
Yes.
So you think I'll be on TV

212
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:36,891
and in movies
and win awards.

213
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:38,810
Honestly?
Yes, honestly.

214
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:40,912
I don't.

215
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:43,681
How could you say that?

216
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:44,849
I don't know...

217
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:46,851
I got all confused when
you said "honestly".

218
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:49,020
Oh!

219
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:52,640
Look, do I think
that you are talented

220
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:53,825
and that you are beautiful?

221
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:55,243
Of course I do.

222
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,662
But isn't Los Angeles
full of actresses

223
00:08:57,664 --> 00:08:58,997
who are just as talented,

224
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:01,199
just as beautiful?

225
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,701
All right, look...
we'll come back to that.

226
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:05,236
No, please.
Don't stop, go on.

227
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:06,588
Tell me how I'm
gonna be a waitress

228
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,872
for the rest of my life.

229
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:09,257
That is not what I said.

230
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,676
Look, I think
you're really good.

231
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,511
I truly do.

232
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:14,913
But this is an
incredibly hard thing

233
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:16,247
that you're shooting for.

234
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:17,582
I mean, the odds

235
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,634
of anyone becoming
a successful actor

236
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:21,386
are like a million to one.

237
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:23,588
Wow, thank you.

238
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:34,449
Should've let Sheldon come.

239
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:43,085
This is interesting.

240
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,220
Apparently,
a key component

241
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:46,739
in some forms of humor

242
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,991
is the element of surprise.

243
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:50,576
Well, that makes sense.

244
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:52,061
The prefrontal cortex

245
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:54,830
is responsible for
planning and anticipation,

246
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:56,499
and patients with
brain lesions on their...

247
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:59,118
Brain lesions!

248
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:05,424
Sheldon, you scared me.

249
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:06,626
That wasn't funny.

250
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:08,410
Or maybe you have a stick

251
00:10:08,412 --> 00:10:09,929
up your prefrontal cortex.

252
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:13,182
Okay, the notion that

253
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:15,184
you can read a few
books and come up with

254
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:17,853
a definitive theory
of comedy is absurd.

255
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:19,272
I mean, humor is

256
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:21,390
a complex neurological...

257
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:27,780
(laughing):
Okay, that's pretty good.

258
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:28,981
Excellent.

259
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,491
How about her?

260
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:39,792
No!

261
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:41,443
No pretty girls!

262
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:43,212
The point is to talk
to regular people

263
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:44,830
and work our way up
to pretty girls.

264
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:46,281
Fine.

265
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:49,168
How about that old lady
with the walker?

266
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,971
That depends.

267
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:55,975
On any level,
do you think she's hot?

268
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:58,177
We'll find somebody else.

269
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:02,865
Kumquat?

270
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:07,570
I guess.

271
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:11,057
Ointment?

272
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:14,777
Sure.

273
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:17,413
Now, would you say
ointment

274
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:22,301
is more, equal to,
or less funny than kumquat?

275
00:11:24,454 --> 00:11:27,957
I don't think I want
to go out with you anymore.

276
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,875
Will you please
stop joking around?

277
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,627
I'm trying to figure this out.

278
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,597
Sheldon, how many words
are you gonna go through?

279
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:36,732
All of them.

280
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:40,603
You didn't get your part cut.

281
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:41,904
(channel changes)

282
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:43,439
WOMAN: All right, baby,
here's the deal.

283
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:46,175
And you didn't get
your part cut.

284
00:11:46,177 --> 00:11:47,376
(rock music plays)

285
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:50,246
Yep, bunch of old guys
rocking out in a band,

286
00:11:50,248 --> 00:11:51,380
all with erectile dysfunction,

287
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:52,915
you didn't get
your part cut!

288
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:56,085
(knocking on door)

289
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,887
Hey.

290
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,521
Can we talk?

291
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:03,843
We can, but the part
of Penny might get cut.

292
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:08,581
That was really
crappy of me.

293
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,866
What you're trying
to do <i>is</i> hard,

294
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,551
but people do make it,

295
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:15,538
and I really do believe
you could be one of them.

296
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,040
Thank you.

297
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,091
And...

298
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:22,311
to show you how much
I believe in you,

299
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:25,097
I kind of got you an audition.

300
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:26,816
Are you serious? For what?

301
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:29,101
The new <i>Star Wars</i> movie.
What?!

302
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:31,887
How did you manage that?!

303
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,722
There's this thing online,
you put yourself on tape

304
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:35,908
and just send it in--
anyone can do it.

305
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:40,162
Come on Leonard,
this is just a PR stunt.

306
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:43,449
So? Even if it is,
you have a huge advantage

307
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:44,900
because you're
an actual actress.

308
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:48,070
Most of the people doing this
are just weirdoes and nerds.

309
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,508
Wolowitz sent his in
two days ago.

310
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,743
Really, let it go.

311
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:57,412
Look, maybe it
is a long shot,

312
00:12:57,414 --> 00:12:58,964
but sometimes
long shots happen.

313
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,133
Luke Skywalker was
only given one chance

314
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,468
to destroy the Death Star.

315
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,254
He had to get a torpedo
into an exhaust port

316
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:06,588
that was only
two meters wide,

317
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,891
but with the help
of The Force, he...

318
00:13:08,893 --> 00:13:12,111
Wow, I can feel you
hating me right now.

319
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:18,067
How about that lady
in the sweat suit, speed-walking?

320
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:20,736
Yeah, she seems friendly
and easy to...

321
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:22,604
Never mind, she's gone.

322
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:28,277
Yeah, maybe talking
to people is too hard.

323
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,629
We could go over to
that department store,

324
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:32,948
practice on
the mannequins.

325
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,983
I don't know.

326
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:35,501
They're dressed
very stylishly.

327
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:37,002
They're probably stuck-up.

328
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:40,589
This is ridiculous.

329
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,291
The next person
that walks by,

330
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:45,261
no matter who it is,
they're the one.

331
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:50,983
We're gonna die here.

332
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,187
Hello.
Hey.

333
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:56,471
Where's Sheldon?

334
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:58,140
He's home trying to use science

335
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:00,526
to determine the basis of humor.

336
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:02,644
That's interesting.
It's exhausting.

337
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:04,479
Do you have
any idea how hard it is

338
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,615
to laugh at a knock-knock
joke that starts with,

339
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:07,816
"Knock-knock-knock, Amy,

340
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:10,336
knock-knock-knock, Amy,
knock-knock-knock, Amy"?

341
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:13,038
If you want him to stop,

342
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,424
sometimes the easiest thing
to do is just fake a laugh.

343
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:18,761
Fake a laugh?

344
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:20,763
Do you ever do that with me?

345
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:24,383
No, of course not.

346
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,886
Well, I'd be able
to tell anyway.

347
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:29,188
I don't think you would.

348
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,840
Please, I've made
plenty of girls laugh,

349
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:34,026
sometimes just by
asking them out.

350
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:35,945
(both laugh)

351
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:40,566
(laughter continues)

352
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,727
Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.

353
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:14,984
Yes, how much for a hundred
long-stemmed red roses?

354
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:18,587
Really?

355
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:20,656
How much for three?

356
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:23,826
Hey.

357
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:25,661
Yeah, I'll call you back.

358
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,065
Look, I know you were
just trying to help

359
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,533
with your <i>Star Wars</i> thing.

360
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:33,235
I didn't mean
to call it idiotic.

361
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:35,671
Well, I don't think
you called it idiotic.

362
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:36,672
Oh.

363
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,607
Sorry, I meant to.

364
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,380
Anyway, um, I was just upset
with myself.

365
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,265
I wasn't mad at you.

366
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:49,351
I just feel like everything
is falling apart.

367
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:51,186
Come on. It's okay.

368
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:53,222
No, it's not okay!
Look at me, okay?!

369
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:55,724
I took a temp job
as a waitress forever ago,

370
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:56,859
and I'm still doing it.

371
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:58,527
I can't quit,
because guess what?

372
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,595
I can't do anything else.

373
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:03,399
And I finally get my big break,
and it goes away!

374
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:04,533
I'm such a mess.

375
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:06,268
No, you're not.
Really?!

376
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,486
'Cause this morning
at Starbucks,

377
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:10,789
a pair of old underwear
fell out of my pant leg!

378
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,628
And it wasn't the only
one in there.

379
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:20,966
Okay, listen to me,
this is just a minor setback.

380
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:22,635
No, it's not, okay?!
I've been out here

381
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:25,304
for, like, ten years!
I've nothing to show for it!

382
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:27,389
Well, you have me.

383
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:30,309
You're right.

384
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:32,761
I do have you.

385
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:34,013
(chuckles)

386
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:35,597
Mm...

387
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:38,517
Let's get married.

388
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:41,520
What?

389
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:44,139
(grunts)

390
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:47,026
Ooh! (chuckles)

391
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:50,312
Leonard Hofstadter...

392
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:51,697
will you marry me?

393
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:54,783
Um...

394
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:59,288
Did you seriously
just say, "Um"?!

395
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,842
Look, you know I love you,

396
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:07,496
but-but you're-you're drunk
and sad and feeling lost...

397
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:10,432
Okay, so-so you don't
want to marry me?!

398
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:11,800
That is not what I said.

399
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:13,835
No, forget it! I take it back!
Offer's off the table!

400
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:16,438
Who's in the mood to laugh?!

401
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:20,008
Really not a good time.

402
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,644
But I used science
to construct the perfect joke.

403
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:24,346
I'm gonna go.
Penny, don't.

404
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:26,899
No, no, I just need
to be alone.

405
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:35,023
So, a sandwich, a rabbi
and yo mama walk into a bar.

406
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:37,126
Where are you going?

407
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:38,860
To my room.
Should I follow you?

408
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:40,195
No.

409
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:41,530
Leonard, wait.

410
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:42,715
What?

411
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:46,051
I forgot to tell you
the sandwich is promiscuous.

412
00:17:56,712 --> 00:17:59,148
How about those guys
on that bench over there?

413
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,082
They look pathetic.

414
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:02,618
I bet we could
talk to them.

415
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,253
That's a mirror.

416
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:07,689
Oh, yeah.

417
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:11,910
Hey, fellas,
mall's closing.

418
00:18:11,912 --> 00:18:13,912
Sorry.
Yeah. Good night.

419
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:16,615
Uh, excuse me.

420
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:17,699
Yeah?

421
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:22,571
Uh, do-do you like being
a mall security guard?

422
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:25,007
It's all right.

423
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:27,626
Okay, nice talking to you.

424
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,300
Smooth...!

425
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:45,260
Can't sleep?

426
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:47,529
No.

427
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,604
Would you like
to talk about it?

428
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:59,224
Penny proposed,
and I didn't say yes.

429
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:02,144
Why not?

430
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:07,082
That's a good question.

431
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:10,803
Does that mean the
relationship is over?

432
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,839
I don't know.

433
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:16,475
Why don't you ask her?

434
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:22,481
Because I'm afraid
to know the answer.

435
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:29,471
Well...

436
00:19:29,473 --> 00:19:30,689
I'm sorry.

437
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,643
That's it?

438
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:37,362
You're not gonna make
some dumb joke

439
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:39,114
or some inappropriate comment?

440
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:42,117
No.

441
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,037
You're my friend, and...

442
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,255
I'm sorry.

443
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:55,497
Did you just put a "kick me"
sign on my back?

444
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:02,004
No.

445
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:04,806
That wouldn't be
funny at all.

446
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:24,342
Star Wars audition, take one...

447
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:28,863
starring Howard Joel Wolowitz,
real-life astronaut.

448
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,219
Vader is here...

449
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:41,038
now... on this moon.

450
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,757
I felt his presence.

451
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,592
He's come for me.

452
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:46,227
He can feel when I'm near...

453
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:47,272
AMY: How many times
do I have to tell you

454
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:49,440
to replace the toilet paper
when it's empty?!

455
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,544
I'm in the middle of something!
So am I!
