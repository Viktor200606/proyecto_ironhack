1
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:19,517
Welcome back to the land
of the living, Mr. Getty.

2
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,260
What...?

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,679
What happened?

4
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:33,916
Just a little brush with death.

5
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:36,634
You had us worried there for a while.

6
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,575
Oh.

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,974
Is my wife here?

8
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,143
No.

9
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,346
I'm sorry, you haven't had any visitors.

10
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,559
Well...

11
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:54,185
we have been having some trouble lately.

12
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:57,855
But you know what?

13
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,158
Second chance on life.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,461
Maybe it's not too late
to turn things around.

15
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,842
No, you wouldn't.

16
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,957
No.

17
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:28,052
So, sorry to shag and
run, darling, but, uh,

18
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,388
I'll see you next time.

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,023
All right.

20
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,525
Ah. Lovely.

21
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,415
Who the hell does he think he is?

22
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,295
Lucifer Morningstar.

23
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:01,098
You're serious? That's his name?

24
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:03,395
What kind of idiot calls himself that?

25
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:05,585
The kind who owns this place.

26
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,896
Don't think I haven't
noticed you watching me.

27
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,798
I know what this is about.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,399
You do?

29
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,068
Yes,

30
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,436
and the answer is no.

31
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,918
I will not sleep with you.

32
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,289
Excuse me?

33
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,741
It's not because you're
a man. It's just because...

34
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,243
Well, I don't find you attractive.

35
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,777
But maybe I could

36
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,814
introduce you to someone
more, you know, your league?

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,215
There's a chubby fellow over there.

38
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,412
I'm sure he wouldn't mind giving
you a reach-around or something.

39
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:36,087
I'm married... to a
woman, thank you very much.

40
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,818
Oh. Does she know you're gay?

41
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:39,020
My wife,

42
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:42,786
who's the smartest and
funniest person I ever met,

43
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,929
and the only woman that I've ever loved,

44
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,731
is sleeping with another man.

45
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:51,402
A sleazy, arrogant,
womanizing piece of garbage.

46
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,426
Well, then, why are you wasting
time trying to pick me up?

47
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:56,039
You should be punishing him.

48
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,328
Oh, don't worry. I'm going to.

49
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:58,809
Oh, are you? Great.

50
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,856
What are you gonna
do, spoons to the eyes?

51
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:02,192
Ants inside his urethra?

52
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:04,181
A Urethra Franklin,
as I like to call it.

53
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,017
I think I'm just gonna
punch him in the face.

54
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,348
Well, that's not enough for
someone who stole your wife.

55
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:11,055
- You're right.
- Yeah.

56
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,835
You should destroy him.

57
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:16,757
Tear his very life apart piece by piece.

58
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:20,989
And normally, I'd help you do that,

59
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,450
but I've picked up a new
hobby recently. Detective!

60
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,954
Detective?

61
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:27,457
Yes. LAPD, and I'm a consultant.

62
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,377
You? You work with the police?

63
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,981
Started a couple of weeks
ago. It's quite fun, actually.

64
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:33,832
Hey, you know, I've
been trying to reach you.

65
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,965
Detective, meet my new friend. Uh...

66
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,769
- Uh, Reese.
- Hi.

67
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:40,281
Ah. Owner of the pieces.

68
00:03:40,284 --> 00:03:41,383
Good to meet you.

69
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:43,086
Uh, sorry to interrupt, but I need

70
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,171
my consultant to sober up
and join me at a crime scene.

71
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:48,912
Oh, sounds lovely. All right.

72
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:49,881
Nice meeting you.

73
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:50,982
Yes. Oh.

74
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:53,351
Good luck with the punishing.

75
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:56,354
Hey, boss, I got something.

76
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:58,056
Sleeping in your office again?

77
00:03:58,058 --> 00:03:59,887
No, I'm working on my new story.

78
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,292
It's about a shady nightclub owner.

79
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:04,162
My top investigative reporter
wants me to approve a piece

80
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:06,497
about overpriced booze
and go-go dancers?

81
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:07,804
No, no, it's a con man.

82
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:09,701
On paper, didn't even
exist five years ago.

83
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:11,710
Tells everyone he's the Devil.

84
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:13,640
So he's a weirdo. I don't see a story.

85
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,406
He's consulting for the LAPD.

86
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,976
I've got a bad feeling
this guy's up to no good.

87
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,618
Remember the last time
I had a bad feeling?

88
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,760
How can I forget your Pulitzer

89
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,194
when you won't stop reminding me?

90
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:24,031
This son of a bitch is hiding something.

91
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:27,018
Who he is, how he's
exploiting the police.

92
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,750
Whatever it is, the people
deserve to know the truth.

93
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:32,062
Bringing this guy down,

94
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:34,726
there wouldn't be a personal
reason behind it, would there?

95
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:37,117
No. Of course not.

96
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:48,039
Lucifer!

97
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,910
Reese. Excuse me.

98
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,678
What are you doing here?

99
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,685
Have you come to tell me about
the punishment you delivered?

100
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,708
Probably not best to go into
detail in a police station.

101
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,245
No. After we met last
night, I realized how...

102
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:03,054
fascinating you are.

103
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,731
Oh, well, I can't argue with that.

104
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,758
I'm a journalist for the LA Telegraph.

105
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,827
So I pitched my editor, and she
said I could do a piece on you.

106
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:13,243
No. What, an entire
article dedicated to me?

107
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:16,067
Right. Well, let's start with a talk.

108
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:17,668
Gosh, this'll be fun.

109
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:27,934
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

110
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:31,635
Can you tell me about this guy, Lucifer?

111
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:33,149
Yeah, he calls himself "the Devil."

112
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:34,884
He helped me out with
some gambling debts.

113
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:36,018
Saved my life.

114
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,387
Five years ago?

115
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,022
I heard he was somewhere
terrible down south.

116
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:41,557
He introduced me to my husband.

117
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,592
And my horse.

118
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:43,993
Maybe Florida?

119
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,396
It's weird, but this is L.A.

120
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:49,732
I don't know what to
tell you. I love the guy.

121
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:50,867
Just love that guy.

122
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:53,569
Everyone here just loves Lucifer.

123
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:54,971
I don't like Lucifer.

124
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:57,071
Really?

125
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:59,208
For starters,

126
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,077
someone's been stealing my pudding.

127
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,627
And I don't think it's a coincidence

128
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,313
that it all started when he showed up.

129
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:05,423
No.

130
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:07,717
And I'm not exactly in love
with the idea of my wife

131
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:10,119
putting herself in danger
just so some club owner

132
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:11,439
can have fun playing cop.

133
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:13,956
You and Detective Decker are married?

134
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,154
We're separated.

135
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:17,894
Oh, but still,

136
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:19,057
that's got to be hard watching them

137
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,396
frolic around in front of you.

138
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:22,728
I wouldn't say "frolic."

139
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,037
Happy to keep this off the record.

140
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,607
Separated is not divorced.
There's still time.

141
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,795
Excuse me. Hi.

142
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:35,197
Uh, I know you.

143
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,732
Aren't you the guy from Lux?

144
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:39,949
Reese Getty, LA Telegraph.

145
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,318
I'm here to write a story
about you and Lucifer.

146
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,686
Oh, right.

147
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:46,088
"Former B-movie Actress Turned Detective

148
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,906
Works With a Whack-Job Consultant."

149
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,209
Sounds about right.

150
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:50,326
Yeah. No thanks.

151
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:52,678
Detective Chloe Decker.
I did my research.

152
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:56,420
Hot Tub High School, your dad, I get it.

153
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:58,000
You don't like the press.

154
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,314
I don't have time for this.

155
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:02,171
I have work to do that
actually contributes to society.

156
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:03,487
I hate to be the one to break it to you,

157
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,267
but your lieutenant and
my editor are like this.

158
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,018
I've been assigned to ride
along with you, Detective.

159
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,826
So we can either make
this a pleasant experience,

160
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:13,015
or we can do it the hard way.

161
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,735
I'll pick the hard way.

162
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:27,296
So, you just started
showing up at crime scenes,

163
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:29,165
and eventually, she
let you work with her?

164
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,833
Uh, more or less.

165
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:33,615
Yeah. Um, excuse us.

166
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:35,438
No, no, no, just... I'll
stay out of your way.

167
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
Just pretend I'm not here.

168
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:39,141
Here you go.

169
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:41,043
What am I supposed to do with these?

170
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,246
Wear them... like you always do.

171
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:44,947
- Oh, right, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:46,314
- I don't.
- Hi.

173
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:48,117
Our victim's name is Poppy Parker.

174
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,886
She owns an organic cosmetics line.

175
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:53,189
Sort of a local celebrity
for all-natural skin care.

176
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:54,923
And, uh, what are all these?

177
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:58,327
These are boobs. Yes,
I'd know them anywhere.

178
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:00,229
C-cups to be precise.

179
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,297
Oh, look at these.

180
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:02,598
Please don't...

181
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,034
juggle the evidence, Lucifer.

182
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:07,003
But it's fine if he does, 'cause,

183
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,670
you know, they've
already been processed.

184
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:10,606
They're called "fun bags" for a reason.

185
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,568
Actually, this one is a
calf implant, so you should

186
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,887
have that, Detective Douche.

187
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,611
Looks like you've been skipping leg day.

188
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:18,714
Yeah, they're very, um,
low quality, actually.

189
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:19,749
More outdated

190
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:21,692
than Dan's flip phone.

191
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:22,846
Don't think any

192
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,654
surgeon in L.A. would use these.

193
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:26,556
Hmm. Okay. We'll look into it.

194
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:29,017
Lucifer, he does this.

195
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,114
He notices things that
normal people are too...

196
00:08:32,117 --> 00:08:34,129
normal to notice,

197
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:35,464
but it, uh,

198
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:36,899
has a tendency of paying off.

199
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:38,067
It does.

200
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:39,101
Why would he do this

201
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,803
to someone who values natural beauty?

202
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:42,004
To punish her?

203
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:44,006
Well, that is a very
good question, Daniel,

204
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:45,441
but as an expert in punishment,

205
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:46,475
because I'm the Devil...

206
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:48,462
- Hmm.
- This isn't punishment.

207
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:49,245
This looks like

208
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,447
someone making a statement.

209
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,849
Well, maybe you're right.

210
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:55,451
Needle mark on the lip,

211
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:58,588
bruising around the injection.
This wasn't postmortem.

212
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,123
Poppy wasn't as all-natural as
she wanted everyone to believe.

213
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,758
She's a fraud.

214
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:05,127
Someone wanted

215
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:07,396
to reveal that the people
around her can't trust her.

216
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:08,700
Ah.

217
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:11,200
If that's the case,
I've seen this before.

218
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:14,303
Oh, very good. Go, Reese Lightning.

219
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:17,809
So, Daniel Moore, vegan chef.

220
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:19,709
Curiously found with
raw meat in his mouth.

221
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:23,045
Ah. So vegans can't
enjoy a healthy sex life?

222
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:25,514
Tough crowd.

223
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:27,083
Turns out, he owns a cattle ranch

224
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:29,619
in Montana, and the
environmentalist who was found

225
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:32,388
drowned in jet fuel, he
actually owned a private plane.

226
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,173
So, someone's killing charlatans. Ah.

227
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,353
The worst kind of scum.

228
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:37,660
Next to boy bands.

229
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:39,562
All three victims had trace amounts of

230
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:41,197
the exact same poison in their system.

231
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:42,965
Same profile, same M.O.

232
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:44,200
This is a serial killer.

233
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:47,407
Yes. The Completely
Justified Killer of Phonies.

234
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,376
If that's what you
name him, I want credit.

235
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,597
The first scene was
found over a month ago.

236
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,641
The environmentalist, a week ago.

237
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:58,948
And Poppy here was found
just a few days later.

238
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,751
I think the killer is
becoming more obsessed.

239
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:03,586
He's accelerating his timeline.

240
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:06,324
We have to catch this guy
before anyone else dies.

241
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:07,726
Why does Lucifer work with you?

242
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,284
I told you, it's an...

243
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:14,062
unconventional
partnership, and it just...

244
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:15,197
That's not it.

245
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,832
What's he get out of it?

246
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:20,261
You'll have to ask him.

247
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:40,289
Hi, hon.

248
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,129
I know you've been avoiding me.

249
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:47,071
I mean, things have been... off lately.

250
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:50,932
But I want to try and
turn things around.

251
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:53,589
Can we talk?

252
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:55,675
I miss you.

253
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,718
Leave Lucifer Morningstar alone.

254
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:11,449
Or you'll be too dead to regret it.

255
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,189
I'm onto something, aren't I?

256
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:14,684
You can't scare me off.

257
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,420
I've been threatened by worse than you.

258
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:19,995
I guarantee you haven't.

259
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:37,980
Oh, Mr. Getty.

260
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:39,882
I need you to look up this address.

261
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:41,217
Something shady

262
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,223
- going on here.
- O-Okay, but there's, uh...

263
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:45,120
Got to be a drug den,
human trafficking...

264
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:47,156
Mr. Getty, your wife's in your office.

265
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:48,524
Really?

266
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:50,126
My wife?

267
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:53,680
How do I look?

268
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:54,918
Uh...

269
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:04,576
Reese.

270
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:06,738
We need to talk.

271
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,693
Linda.

272
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:13,107
You look... wow.

273
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:16,042
We should go to dinner.

274
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:18,011
Our favorite Italian
place is still open.

275
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:19,161
I'll make reservations.

276
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:22,715
Reese, why are people in your
office calling me your wife?

277
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:24,841
Because you are my wife.

278
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,587
No. We're separated.

279
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,524
It's been two years.

280
00:12:31,526 --> 00:12:33,560
That's actually why I'm here.

281
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:38,097
I have been more than
patient, but it's time.

282
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:45,805
Sign the divorce papers, please.

283
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,466
Is this because you're
seeing someone else?

284
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:53,212
No. No, this isn't because
I'm seeing someone, Reese.

285
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:57,317
You can't keep leaving
me voicemails like that.

286
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,187
Things are not "off
lately," things are over.

287
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:03,222
You need to move on.

288
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:04,724
I can't move on.

289
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:08,094
Don't you know how much I love you?

290
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:10,129
You never give up.

291
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:14,467
It's one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.

292
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:17,837
But that was a long time ago.

293
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,333
Not that long ago.

294
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:21,040
This is classic denial.

295
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,842
It's a self-defense
mechanism that you...

296
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,177
Don't analyze me, Linda.

297
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:26,880
Sorry.

298
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,185
We're over.

299
00:13:33,935 --> 00:13:35,552
Sign them.

300
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,927
I'm working on something,
and I need a little more time.

301
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,263
Why? Nothing you're working
on is gonna change anything.

302
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:47,494
24 hours, that's all I'm asking for.

303
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:50,336
Okay, if I do...

304
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:52,739
you'll finally sign the papers?

305
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,382
I promise.

306
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:12,325
Hey. Did you find anything
about that address yet?

307
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:14,427
It's a known hot spot
for trading stolen goods.

308
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,685
I knew he was up to something.

309
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,121
Fencing? Smuggling? Or worse?

310
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,525
Well, I can do some
research on the building.

311
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:19,893
No, I need proof right now.

312
00:14:21,102 --> 00:14:22,769
Lucifer's duffel bag.

313
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:24,837
I need to get it.

314
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:57,739
Another piano?

315
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,288
What the...?

316
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,794
Uh, uh, don't worry.

317
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:19,726
I'm gonna get you out of here.

318
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:22,568
Well, hello.

319
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,237
What the hell are you doing here?

320
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,100
Well, it appears I've caught
you sneaking into my penthouse.

321
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,302
So perhaps you should
answer that question.

322
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,638
What story are you really
looking for, reporter?

323
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,708
I'm gonna expose you
for the fraud you are.

324
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:37,777
And save this woman.

325
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:38,945
Don't you try and stop me.

326
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:40,847
I won't. She might, though.

327
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:43,049
Who is this guy, Lucifer?

328
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:44,484
He doesn't seem very fun.

329
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,654
You're not tied up against your will?

330
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:48,654
Um, no.

331
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,989
I'm pretty into this.

332
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,758
At least I was until you got here.

333
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,726
All right, that doesn't matter.

334
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:55,361
I know I'm onto something.

335
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:58,364
Otherwise, why would you send
that crazy ninja woman after me?

336
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,600
Crazy ninja wom... oh, Maze?

337
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:01,768
No, I didn't send her.

338
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,170
She's just a tad
overprotective, that's all.

339
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,239
Demon bartenders, you
know how they can be.

340
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:08,341
What about that pile of
cash I saw you give that cop?

341
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,876
Yes, to buy his duffel bag.

342
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,326
Hard to find quality leather

343
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:12,912
with such tensile strength.

344
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:13,846
The bag.

345
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,271
That's right.

346
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,717
This will prove everything.

347
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,152
What is this?

348
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,291
Are these sex toys?

349
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:26,760
Edible sex toys,

350
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:27,583
to be precise.

351
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,195
Not exactly FDA approved,

352
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,043
so I had to sneak the delicious things

353
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:32,424
through customs.

354
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:34,367
How could I be so wrong?

355
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:37,847
About so many things?

356
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,697
Look, I know why you're upset.

357
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,379
You thought you had a nice,
juicy scoop for your paper.

358
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,215
And I don't blame you.
You're just doing your job.

359
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,118
Unfortunately for you,
the only juicy thing here

360
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,833
is the, uh... Watermelon Willies.

361
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:56,923
They're pretty good. You should try one.

362
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:58,658
- Mm.
- I'm allergic to watermelon.

363
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:02,708
Oh. Look, why don't you come with me?

364
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:05,057
The detective just called
with some sort of lead.

365
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,500
I always find catching
a killer cheers me up.

366
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:09,718
I mean, I was gonna do
Veronica first, but...

367
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:11,304
you don't mind waiting, do you, darling?

368
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:12,805
- Not at all.
- Good.

369
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:13,906
Come on.

370
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,808
Excuse me.

371
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,109
Do you mind?

372
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,391
Thank you.

373
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:24,350
You were right about the implants.

374
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:27,601
They were pulled from the market
years ago due to rupturing.

375
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:31,012
Oh, a moment of silence for all
those poor, mishandled breasts.

376
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:32,391
They're illegal to sell anywhere,

377
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:34,193
but we pulled a partial serial number

378
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:35,862
that pointed to a
plastic surgeon's office

379
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:37,430
in Beverly Hills.

380
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,099
Wait, you, Scarface?

381
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:44,601
You resent your clients, don't you?

382
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:47,164
- I don't...
- You want them to suffer.

383
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,542
I do.

384
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,911
I want all of them to suffer.

385
00:17:51,913 --> 00:17:53,546
Good work on the case.

386
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,381
Realizing that his scar

387
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:58,384
made him resent other
people around him...

388
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:00,019
that was good.

389
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:01,578
Good detective work.

390
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,589
Reese, you okay?

391
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:04,867
Reese.

392
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:08,694
You were right.

393
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,162
About?

394
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,300
I wanted to write a piece that
showed that your partnership

395
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,135
was a dangerous joke.

396
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,305
That Lucifer was a fraud.

397
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,440
But the truth is

398
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:25,211
he's just frustratingly, annoyingly...

399
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:26,545
a charming guy.

400
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:29,248
And you and him...

401
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,119
you two work well together.

402
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:34,854
There's no story here.

403
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,522
I'm just gonna drop it.

404
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:38,090
Is this some weird journalist tactic

405
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:39,525
to get me to lower my guard?

406
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:40,711
I wish.

407
00:18:40,714 --> 00:18:42,426
No, this is just me
getting out of the way,

408
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,163
so you can do your job.

409
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,531
Catch more killers.

410
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,867
Unfortunately, Barry's not our killer.

411
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,002
He sold expired medical goods

412
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,405
from the office, including
some tainted Botox

413
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:53,839
that poisoned a few people.

414
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,742
And although

415
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:56,343
he'll spend a very long time in jail,

416
00:18:56,346 --> 00:18:57,392
he's not our guy.

417
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:59,144
But if he sold supplies to the killer,

418
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:00,695
he should know something.

419
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:02,949
Well, he wouldn't give us
any information on the buyer.

420
00:19:02,951 --> 00:19:05,151
Probably scared, but
we'll get it out of him.

421
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:07,953
Detective, the
lieutenant's asking for you.

422
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:09,051
Okay.

423
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:10,053
Uh, excuse me.

424
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:11,570
Be right back.

425
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:13,006
Thank you.

426
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,465
Right.

427
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,467
Now the detective's
gone, let's have a chat.

428
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:22,945
Just the two of us, shall we?

429
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:25,336
Look, I don't know anything, okay?

430
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:26,706
Yes, yes, you plead ignorance,

431
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,075
and then we sweat you until
you finally give us a name.

432
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:30,843
I'm sorry, I don't have time for that.

433
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:32,945
I've got a lovely lady
tied up back at my place.

434
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:34,580
So I'd like to speed things up.

435
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:40,586
Listen, listen, man,

436
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:42,406
I... wait...

437
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:43,856
Please stop! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

438
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:44,965
I don't know his name!

439
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:47,326
I only know his, his username, okay?!

440
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:49,095
"TruthDog21"!

441
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:51,097
Please! Stop!

442
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,232
Oh, oh!

443
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,789
Oh.

444
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,787
Oh...

445
00:20:24,285 --> 00:20:26,697
You have to stop seeing
Lucifer Morningstar.

446
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:28,465
How did you get that name?

447
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:29,833
- Uh...
- Okay, invading my privacy

448
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:31,201
is one thing,

449
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:32,636
but if you're stalking my clients...

450
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:33,570
I'm not stalking him.

451
00:20:33,572 --> 00:20:35,715
I was working on a story with him.

452
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:38,909
Oh, okay, so you just happened
to be working on a story

453
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:39,943
with Lucifer.

454
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:41,878
Okay, I know this sounds crazy, it...

455
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:44,147
He's the Devil.

456
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:45,379
And I-I don't mean in-in a,

457
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:47,216
in a douchebag,
club-owning kind of way.

458
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:49,219
I mean...

459
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:50,487
he's the actual Devil.

460
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:54,039
Yes, Lucifer is insistent
on this Devil persona.

461
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,734
No, he isn't some patient.

462
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,928
That's just a ploy that
he used to seduce you.

463
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,498
Okay, so that's what this is about.

464
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,239
It is none of your business

465
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,516
who I sleep with.

466
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,318
It is if it's Satan himself.

467
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,836
I don't think you've understood
exactly what it is you're doing.

468
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,228
Oh, I know exactly what I'm doing.

469
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:15,746
I'm enjoying myself with someone

470
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:18,081
who doesn't make me feel trapped.

471
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,551
Lucifer is someone who is

472
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:24,383
completely present in the moment.

473
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:26,813
Who gives me 100% of his attention.

474
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:29,526
And doesn't demand anything from me.

475
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:31,989
I guess if you want to vilify him

476
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:33,133
and call him the Devil...

477
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:34,235
No, he is the Devil.

478
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,770
But being with him

479
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:41,875
is the most liberating
experience of my life.

480
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,642
I see, he's-he's got you
under some sort of spell.

481
00:21:45,644 --> 00:21:49,813
You know, I've been
incredibly patient with you,

482
00:21:49,815 --> 00:21:53,283
because I still care about you,

483
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:56,186
still worry about you.

484
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:58,141
But I just can't take it anymore.

485
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,445
Okay, if I can come up with
proof that he is the Devil...

486
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,681
Sign the papers!

487
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:14,037
You've got a lot you
need to figure out, Reese.

488
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:19,176
You're right.

489
00:22:19,178 --> 00:22:21,063
I do.

490
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:53,864
Reese?

491
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,505
It's Detective Decker.

492
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:57,641
We could really use your help.

493
00:24:06,983 --> 00:24:08,516
How can I help you, Detective?

494
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:10,587
Shower and a shave, maybe.

495
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:13,523
We're here about the serial
killer case from last year.

496
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:15,668
I thought the killer went dormant.

497
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:16,493
He has,

498
00:24:16,495 --> 00:24:19,429
but we're still investigating
the case, and we've had a break.

499
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:20,664
All the victims were

500
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:21,965
local celebrities who were featured

501
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,633
in the Telegraph's style section.

502
00:24:23,635 --> 00:24:24,859
You think he read the article?

503
00:24:24,862 --> 00:24:26,837
And we hope he commented
on them. We have a handle

504
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,921
we think he used, TruthDog21.

505
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:30,181
Well, the comments are public.

506
00:24:30,184 --> 00:24:31,775
- You can search them.
- We have.

507
00:24:31,777 --> 00:24:33,476
We didn't find anything, but we want...

508
00:24:33,478 --> 00:24:35,478
But I was complaining to the detective

509
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,514
about some posts of mine
that have been removed

510
00:24:37,516 --> 00:24:40,217
from a web site for roosters
of award-winning size.

511
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:42,350
You see, I was posting pictures of my...

512
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:43,447
Okay.

513
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,222
Okay.

514
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:49,041
Does your paper archive
redacted comments?

515
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:51,463
Uh, anything that's
threatening or violent.

516
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:53,029
Or of award-winning size.

517
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:54,698
Uh, yeah, sure.

518
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,800
Just give the information
to my assistant.

519
00:24:56,802 --> 00:24:59,336
He'll gather the info. It
might take a day or two.

520
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:01,605
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

521
00:25:05,744 --> 00:25:07,477
You still haven't
destroyed him, have you?

522
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:08,778
Excuse me?

523
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,595
That sleazy piece of garbage

524
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:12,816
who was sleeping with your wife.

525
00:25:12,818 --> 00:25:14,317
No.

526
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,819
I'm starting to think

527
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:18,922
that he might be undestroyable.

528
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:20,257
Well, perhaps you're not

529
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:22,359
thinking outside the box enough, Reesey.

530
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:24,361
Don't be afraid to take a big swing.

531
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:25,762
It can be therapeutic.

532
00:25:25,764 --> 00:25:27,430
Oh, speaking of...

533
00:25:27,432 --> 00:25:31,234
I'm late for my own therapy. Again.

534
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:33,436
She's gonna kill me.

535
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:49,872
She said that was a ridiculous idea...

536
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,975
- Linda.
- Reese.

537
00:25:51,978 --> 00:25:53,924
What, you know him as well?

538
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:56,493
- My ex-husband, Reese...
- Linda.

539
00:25:56,495 --> 00:25:58,717
- Stay back.
- Your ex-husband?

540
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,430
So we're tunnel buddies.

541
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:01,564
Hey.

542
00:26:06,304 --> 00:26:08,337
You realize what you just did?

543
00:26:10,055 --> 00:26:12,322
You just ruined a
perfectly good Burberry.

544
00:26:12,324 --> 00:26:14,290
- What kind of monster are you?
- See?

545
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:16,893
- He's the Devil! I told you.
- Y-You tried to kill him.

546
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:19,317
Yeah, but I didn't. He's
invincible because he's the Devil.

547
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,804
- See? There's your proof.
- Reese...

548
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:22,265
You're lucky the detective isn't here.

549
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:24,100
You'd be cleaning my
blood out of the couch.

550
00:26:24,102 --> 00:26:25,602
Put the gun down, Reese.

551
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:27,704
Right, I don't need
it anymore. Look, I...

552
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,940
I know it's a lot to process,

553
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:32,475
but you've got to believe me.

554
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:34,010
Reese, I know he's the Devil.

555
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:35,645
What?

556
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:38,472
You... you... you do?

557
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:40,917
Is this what you were trying
to tell me all those months ago?

558
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,720
I saw his real face.

559
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:45,688
If you see it, then you'll know.

560
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,689
I have seen it.

561
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:48,124
And I know.

562
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:49,692
I know

563
00:26:49,694 --> 00:26:51,594
- how unsettling it can be.
- Yes.

564
00:26:51,596 --> 00:26:52,729
And if you're this unsettled by me,

565
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:54,030
I'd hate to see what you're gonna do

566
00:26:54,032 --> 00:26:55,331
to the scoundrel who's been sleeping

567
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,533
with your wife.

568
00:26:56,535 --> 00:26:58,207
I'm so sorry.

569
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,710
I didn't realize what
you were going through.

570
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:05,107
I didn't know the truth,

571
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,110
and I didn't think you did either.

572
00:27:07,112 --> 00:27:09,479
But you know now.

573
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:10,814
And you're still seeing him?

574
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:12,730
Only professionally, Reese,

575
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,150
much to my disappointment.

576
00:27:14,152 --> 00:27:18,221
When I first learned
who he really was, it...

577
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:21,090
it-it turned my world upside down.

578
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,512
But he's not what you think.

579
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:24,479
He's the Devil!

580
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:26,010
Oh, it's not like I've hidden that fact.

581
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,164
- He's evil incarnate!
- No.

582
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:31,602
No, he's a good man.

583
00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:36,093
He's my friend.

584
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:41,332
All this time I've been...

585
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:45,081
trying to prove to you who he really is.

586
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,673
And not only

587
00:27:46,676 --> 00:27:49,853
did you already know...

588
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:51,120
you didn't care.

589
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:52,789
Sit down, Reese, let's
talk this through.

590
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,190
- No, no.
- Please, Reese.

591
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:07,782
Your assistant left your
redacted comments research

592
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:09,606
on my desk.

593
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:14,010
Are you still working on
this nightclub owner thing?

594
00:28:14,012 --> 00:28:16,379
He's not just a nightclub owner.

595
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:18,840
So do you have a story for me,
something I can actually print,

596
00:28:18,843 --> 00:28:20,517
or just arts and crafts?

597
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,584
This has to stop.

598
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:23,353
- Now.
- I can't.

599
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:26,356
I can't let this guy win.

600
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:28,291
You have filed, barely,

601
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:30,493
a dozen other stories this year.

602
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:32,462
And you have nothing to
show for all this work.

603
00:28:32,464 --> 00:28:34,402
Reese!

604
00:28:36,724 --> 00:28:39,391
This guy has won.

605
00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:41,738
I'm telling you this as your friend.

606
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,972
If you don't

607
00:28:42,974 --> 00:28:45,708
let this go, it's going to
be the end of your career.

608
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:28,844
You're lucky the detective isn't here.

609
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:30,820
You'd be cleaning my
blood out of the couch.

610
00:29:58,281 --> 00:30:00,415
- Alvin Kapitski?
- Yeah.

611
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:02,651
Registered on the LA Telegraph web site

612
00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:04,454
as "TruthDog21"?

613
00:30:04,456 --> 00:30:06,662
I wanted to ask you a few questions

614
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:08,791
about some comments that you posted

615
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:11,327
on some stories we
ran about Poppy Parker

616
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:12,495
and Daniel Moore.

617
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:14,772
Okay.

618
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:16,617
Okay.

619
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,638
I knew this day would come.

620
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,339
I'll surrender quietly.

621
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:24,474
Oh, no.

622
00:30:24,476 --> 00:30:26,175
I'm not a cop.

623
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:28,198
I'm a reporter.

624
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,113
I just want to talk to you.

625
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:34,283
You're here to do a story on me?

626
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:37,720
Well, my job is to dig up the truth.

627
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:40,390
Expose people for who they really are.

628
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:42,025
And once I saw your work,

629
00:30:42,027 --> 00:30:43,715
I-I realized that

630
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:46,085
- you were just doing the same thing.
- Yeah.

631
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:47,688
Yeah, I was.

632
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:51,234
I'm back on my meds now.

633
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,302
I'm trying to be good.
It's hard, but I'm trying.

634
00:30:53,304 --> 00:30:55,238
- I'm trying, I'm trying.
- I get it.

635
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,007
It's just, I met this guy

636
00:30:58,009 --> 00:30:59,642
recently.

637
00:30:59,644 --> 00:31:02,612
Biggest fraud I'd ever encountered.

638
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:04,414
Yeah?

639
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:06,528
I tried to expose him,

640
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,019
show everybody the
liar that he really is.

641
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:12,422
What happened?

642
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:14,390
He won.

643
00:31:14,392 --> 00:31:17,387
They always do, don't they?

644
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:22,273
Unless someone does something.

645
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:31,140
What's his name?

646
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:38,347
Hi.

647
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:39,816
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey,

648
00:31:39,818 --> 00:31:41,832
you're helping me, so thanks.

649
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:45,121
Although I have no idea
why we had to meet here.

650
00:31:45,123 --> 00:31:46,322
Those them?

651
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:48,391
Yeah, uh,

652
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:50,359
all the redacted comments.

653
00:31:53,431 --> 00:31:55,934
Uh, but first,

654
00:31:55,937 --> 00:31:57,867
I never did get to interview you.

655
00:31:57,869 --> 00:32:00,503
You know, you really had me fooled.

656
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:02,004
Thought you were different.

657
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:04,043
Fine, ask away.

658
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:06,155
What do you think Lucifer gets

659
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,658
out of this partnership?

660
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,646
You already asked me that.

661
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:13,649
Uh, but you never answered.

662
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:17,614
Um... I think,

663
00:32:17,617 --> 00:32:18,955
a long time ago,

664
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:20,754
somebody wronged Lucifer.

665
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:22,591
I think he avoided dealing with it,

666
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:23,793
and he hides

667
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:25,707
behind the partying

668
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,309
and the women and the drinking,
and who knows what else.

669
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:30,967
And with the LAPD,

670
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:33,669
working on each case, it
gives him an opportunity

671
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,805
to right those wrongs, to fight back.

672
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:37,540
Oh.

673
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:39,308
You think that's funny?

674
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,344
Uh, no, no. I'm sorry.

675
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:43,567
I just think, uh,

676
00:32:43,577 --> 00:32:45,829
you give him more credit

677
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:47,121
than he deserves.

678
00:32:47,124 --> 00:32:48,718
Well, I don't think you give him enough.

679
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:05,668
You may be right.

680
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:09,605
Thanks, Detective.

681
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:19,728
Um...

682
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:20,883
these, uh...

683
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:22,285
these look incomplete.

684
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:26,289
Help! Help, help!

685
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:29,225
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!

686
00:33:37,168 --> 00:33:38,367
She's dead.

687
00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:42,707
What happened?

688
00:33:45,143 --> 00:33:47,844
Yeah, you were right.

689
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:49,111
Looks like the same poison

690
00:33:49,113 --> 00:33:50,613
that was used by that serial killer

691
00:33:50,615 --> 00:33:51,781
you guys were after.

692
00:33:51,783 --> 00:33:54,584
They did this under my own roof.

693
00:33:54,586 --> 00:33:56,052
My home.

694
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:02,458
How-how could the killer be here

695
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,027
the exact same time we were?

696
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:08,231
Must be something, must...

697
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,267
It must be you.

698
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:13,870
What? What do you mean?

699
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:15,271
He was here for you.

700
00:34:15,273 --> 00:34:17,306
He must have figured
out that you were gonna

701
00:34:17,308 --> 00:34:19,275
pass over information about him.

702
00:34:19,277 --> 00:34:20,848
I'm so sorry.

703
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,245
This is... this is all my fault.

704
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:23,895
I'm to blame. I put you in danger.

705
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:26,816
No, no, no, this is not your fault.

706
00:34:26,818 --> 00:34:29,252
There's only one person
who's to blame for this.

707
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,189
Yeah.

708
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,743
I'm in no mood for whatever it is.

709
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:46,002
You.

710
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:49,582
This is all your fault.

711
00:34:53,098 --> 00:34:55,951
You ruined my life. You
drove me to do things

712
00:34:55,954 --> 00:34:57,109
I never would've done.

713
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:58,844
And now...

714
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,880
there's a dead girl down
there because of you.

715
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,482
What is it with you humans?

716
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,947
Huh? Always blaming me.

717
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,192
I never make any of you do anything.

718
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:10,717
That's not true.

719
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,857
You trick us

720
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,871
into sin,

721
00:35:12,874 --> 00:35:14,427
damnation.

722
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:19,298
I have a story for you, reporter.

723
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,864
One I've never told a human soul before.

724
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:27,173
I take no part in who goes to Hell.

725
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:28,841
Then who does?

726
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:30,275
You humans.

727
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:32,278
You send yourselves.

728
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,947
Driven down by your own guilt.

729
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:36,816
Forcing yourselves

730
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:39,318
to relive your sins over and over.

731
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,004
And the best part...

732
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:45,124
the doors aren't locked.

733
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,026
You could leave anytime.

734
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:48,561
It says something

735
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,563
that no one ever does, doesn't it?

736
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,082
No.

737
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:53,384
You're to blame.

738
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:56,402
I am responsible for
a lot of things, Reese,

739
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,737
but not your soul,

740
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,038
not your actions,

741
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,274
and not whoever killed
that poor girl downstairs.

742
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:04,504
Eh, you...

743
00:36:04,507 --> 00:36:06,740
you have to be.

744
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:08,042
Otherwise...

745
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:15,739
Hurting me is not what you
really want to do, is it?

746
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,326
What are you doing to me?

747
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:23,949
Oh, you're a complicated
one, aren't you, Reese?

748
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:25,118
Strong.

749
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:26,666
Tell me...

750
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:30,636
what do you truly desire?

751
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:32,340
I...

752
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,810
I just want Linda to love me.

753
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:41,793
You're still in love with your ex?

754
00:36:41,796 --> 00:36:43,115
What about your wife?

755
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,583
She is my wife.

756
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,688
She'll always be my wife.

757
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,683
So... hold on,

758
00:36:50,686 --> 00:36:52,778
that-that sleazy, piece
of garbage, that...

759
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:55,428
that was me?

760
00:36:57,765 --> 00:37:00,066
It was me.

761
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:01,634
The way she looks at you.

762
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,635
Ah...

763
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,603
She cares for you.

764
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:06,965
How'd you do that?

765
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:12,945
How did you convince her that
the Devil, of all people...

766
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:14,280
was good?

767
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:17,650
I don't know.

768
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,953
I just... showed her my true self.

769
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:23,723
But how could she accept you after that?

770
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:28,894
Well, maybe she did... because of that.

771
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:32,131
Hmm.

772
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,468
Before you say anything, hear me out.

773
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,103
There's nothing you can say.

774
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:38,437
I was a bad husband.

775
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,872
Put my work above everything,

776
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:41,307
above us.

777
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:42,641
Our marriage failing

778
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:43,876
was all my fault.

779
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:45,077
And I'm sorry.

780
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,250
You deserved better.

781
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:56,155
Well, if we're... if
we're being honest...

782
00:37:58,092 --> 00:38:01,153
it wasn't all your fault.

783
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,923
I wasn't perfect either.

784
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,099
Truth is...

785
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:09,969
neither one of us could be
what the other one needed.

786
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:12,171
That's why it's good

787
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:14,153
that we're going our separate ways.

788
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:17,143
But, Linda, no, no, I...

789
00:38:17,145 --> 00:38:20,312
I thought me opening up
would bring us closer.

790
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:23,182
Like it did with you and Lucifer.

791
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:24,850
Reese,

792
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:26,621
that's not how this works.

793
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,848
You forgave the Devil.

794
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:31,223
Why can't you forgive me?

795
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,827
You know, for a second,

796
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:38,497
I thought that you were
honestly taking responsibility.

797
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:41,700
But it's always the same
with you, over and over.

798
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:44,325
So determined, you never
listen, never learn.

799
00:38:44,328 --> 00:38:45,738
Do you know how much I love you?

800
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,540
The things that I've done for you.

801
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:48,941
I went up against the Devil.

802
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:51,677
I risked everything getting
involved with a serial killer.

803
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,368
A poor girl got killed!

804
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:54,947
Wait, what?

805
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:56,248
I-I can explain...

806
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,283
Reese, what have you done?

807
00:38:57,285 --> 00:38:58,584
No, it-it wasn't my fault.

808
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,919
- I'm calling the police.
- No.

809
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:00,953
It was an accident.

810
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:03,322
I-I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

811
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:05,825
- Reese.
- Stop.

812
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:07,726
- Let me explain.
- Reese, let go of me.

813
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:08,694
- Reese.
- No, no!

814
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:10,387
- No!
- Reese, no!

815
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:16,035
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

816
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:22,274
You're right.

817
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,876
Call Detective Decker.

818
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:25,811
Tell them they can find me at my office.

819
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:29,949
I'll give them everything
that I have on Kapitski.

820
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,989
And I'll turn myself in.

821
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:33,324
I'm sorry.

822
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:39,191
You were right.

823
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:40,492
Let me make this right.

824
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:42,395
Good-bye, Reese.

825
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:09,088
You sent me to kill the wrong man.

826
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,357
Lucifer wasn't a fraud.

827
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,691
He's an honest man.

828
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:13,959
As honest as they come.

829
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,929
No, no, the fraud is you!

830
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:19,498
Reporter lying to people.

831
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,067
A coward trying to get another
man to do his dirty work.

832
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:24,348
You're the one who deserves to go next.

833
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,640
And now you will.

834
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,345
What are you laughing about?

835
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:33,245
I caught you.

836
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:35,848
Crap!

837
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,616
Let go! No!

838
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:46,225
Stay down.

839
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:58,637
Oh, Reesey.

840
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,773
You laying down on the job?

841
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:04,681
Don't tell me, asthma.

842
00:41:04,684 --> 00:41:06,153
That...

843
00:41:06,156 --> 00:41:08,246
or the poison I drank.

844
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:15,020
Well...

845
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:16,606
you didn't drink all of it.

846
00:41:17,793 --> 00:41:20,826
I set things right.

847
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:24,496
Maybe this will turn things around...

848
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:25,831
with Linda.

849
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,536
Welcome back to the land
of the living, Mr. Getty.

850
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:04,296
What...

851
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:05,732
what happened?

852
00:42:05,735 --> 00:42:08,307
Just a little brush with death.

853
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:11,447
You had us worried there for a while.

854
00:42:15,803 --> 00:42:17,002
Is my wife here?

855
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:19,650
No.

856
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:22,554
I'm sorry, you haven't had any visitors.

857
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:25,754
Well...

858
00:42:25,757 --> 00:42:28,090
we have been having some trouble lately.

859
00:42:30,477 --> 00:42:32,143
But you know what?

860
00:42:32,146 --> 00:42:34,080
Second chance on life.

861
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,813
Maybe it's not too late
to turn things around.
