<i>Previously on Lucifer...</i>

2
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:04,474
Tell me, what do you desire?

3
00:00:04,476 --> 00:00:05,959
This is it? This is your big trick?

4
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:07,419
Why don't I affect you, Detective?

5
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,095
I guess we both have our mysteries.

6
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:11,597
35 years ago, Father
asked me to come down here

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,533
to bless a couple who was
unable to have a child.

8
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,802
You look really familiar. Have we met?

9
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:18,237
<i>MOM: Your Father put
her in Lucifer's path.</i>

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,639
We're going home, son.

11
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:22,342
<i>And Chloe is the key.</i>

12
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:25,111
Andy Kleinberg? Jana Lawrence
was found murdered this morning.

13
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:27,793
<i>KLEINBERG: One of them broke.
I spilled a little on myself.</i>

14
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:29,782
What the hell is happening to me?

15
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:32,452
<i>MAZE: So what if you slept
with Charlotte Richards?</i>

16
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:33,987
You slept with my...

17
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,321
Whoa!

18
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:37,348
He's different when he's with you.

<i>Chloe Decker is causing
your vulnerability.</i>

20
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:40,326
<i>I'm bleeding.</i>

21
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:41,995
Do you think I'm boyfriend material?

22
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:43,830
Perhaps you've been
underestimating yourself.

23
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:45,965

What are you doing in here?

48
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:01,674
What? I heard you
scream, so I ran in to see

49
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:03,576
if you were in danger.
Then I figured out

50
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:05,978
what was really going on, you know,

51
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,280
so I stayed to watch the show.

52
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:08,448
Hey.

53
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,616
What was that... That
thing you were doing?

54
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:11,617
You were like...

55
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:12,919
Okay, Maze,

56
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:14,387
get out.

57
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:15,700
Now.

58
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:18,157
All right, at least you're
getting laid in your dreams.

59
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,259
'Cause it's not happening in real life.

60
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:21,861
You don't know that.

61
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:25,698
I just wish you'd loosen up, Decker.

62
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,400
You know, throw caution to the wind,

63
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:28,935
be impulsive,

64
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:30,803
just once.

65
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:32,672
Instead of, you know,

66
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:34,373
being you.

67
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:39,812
(door opens)

68
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:40,947
(door closes)

69
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:45,852
Maybe this time will be different.

70
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:49,589
This time will definitely
be different, Doctor.

71
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:52,325
I've decided to take
things slow, for once.

72
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:55,194
Hmm, and why is that?

73
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:58,064
Because I'm a responsible Devil.

74
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:02,768
And I... well, I know what
a big deal the kiss was...

75
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,903
for the detective.

76
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:05,271
For her?

77
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:06,439
Well, I'm sure it must have made

78
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:07,473
quite an impact on her.

79
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:10,076
I mean, it, it is me.

80
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:11,210
No doubt she's overwhelmed

81
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:12,912
by emotions she's never felt before.

82
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:14,147
She's overwhelmed?

83
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,381
- Mm.
- Uh-huh.

84
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:16,682
Is that why you went your separate ways

85
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:17,717
after the kiss?

86
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,452
Precisely.

87
00:03:19,454 --> 00:03:21,487
Yes, although she did have
that wretched dependent

88
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:22,688
waiting for her at home.

89
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,024
Well, two, if you count the child.

90
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:27,326
I think I know what's happening.

91
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:28,995
Y-You do?

92
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:30,663
You're stalling, Lucifer.

93
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:32,231
(laughing): Stalling?

94
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,934
Sex? Me?

95
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,369
Doctor, have we even met before?

96
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,304
You're stalling because you've realized

97
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:40,640
how complicated your relationship is.

98
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:42,208
Look... (sighs)

99
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,077
the, um, the truth is that...

100
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,646
I still don't understand why,

101
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:51,417
after everything I said about
my less positive qualities,

102
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,586
she still chose to kiss me.

103
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:55,288
I mean, do you think she's ill?

104
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,323
Or maybe...

105
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:59,130
she's just taken by you?

106
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,893
Well, that's impossible.

107
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:03,596
The detective is completely
immune to my charms.

108
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:09,202
Or she was immune.

109
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:10,937
Maybe that's what's changed.

110
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:13,873
Of course, I mean why
else would she kiss me?

111
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,544
But there's also the possibility...

112
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:16,209
No, no, no.

113
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,077
No. That's very good.

114
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,379
Thank you, Doctor.

115
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,547
I know what to do now.

116
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,683
(door opens)

117
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:28,955
Morning.

118
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:31,090
Hey.

119
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:32,959
So, how was the rest of your night?

120
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,994
It was fine, thank you.

121
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:36,722
How was the rest of your night?

122
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:39,365
Uh, fine, thank you.

123
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:40,933
Excellent. So we're all fine, then.

124
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:42,001
But before we deal with

125
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:43,336
whatever atrocity awaits,

126
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:44,537
there's something important

127
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,405
I need to ask you, Detective. It's...

128
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:47,873
well, it's about us.

129
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,009
Okay.

130
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,502
So what is it you truly desire now?

131
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,885
Lucifer, what the hell are you doing?

132
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:01,287
You know that stuff doesn't work on me.

133
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:02,888
Right.

134
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,224
Yes, no, of course. I was, uh, joking.

135
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:06,359
(chuckles)

136
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,279
Right.

137
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,264
(laughs)

138
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,101
I was just trying to...

139
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:18,337
Maze said this morning, you know,

140
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:21,240
throw caution to
the... Never mind, it...

141
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:24,343
That was weird. Yeah. We... let's go.

142
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,911
Right.

143
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:31,984
Right, what have we got?

144
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:35,421
ELLA: Meet Rick Cormier.

145
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:39,392
19-years-old. Malibu State freshman.

146
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:41,946
Friends thought he was just
hungover after the big win

147
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,696
against the Pasadena Gray Hawks.

148
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:45,331
Turns out, he be dead.

149
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,499
Of poisoning.

150
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:48,167
- Ooh.
- Like alcohol poisoning?

151
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,070
No, like poison poisoning.

152
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:52,171
Check it out:

153
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:54,340
petechial hemorrhaging,

154
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:56,976
ribboned skin,

155
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:58,757
ocular discharge.

156
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:00,579
(chuckles) Sorry, she said "discharge,"

157
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:01,614
it gets me every time.

158
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,570
(laughs)

159
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:06,352
Any idea

160
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,108
of how long it took
the poison to activate?

161
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,556
ELLA: Well, it's hard to
say for sure, but best guess,

162
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:11,824
maybe 24 hours?

163
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:13,793
I hope poor Ricky made 'em count.

164
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:16,962
Enjoying what little life he
had left with sex or friends.

165
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:19,732
Or sex with friends.

166
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:24,316
I just figured that's where
you were going with that.

167
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,205
ELLA: Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know

168
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:27,740
how down he was to party,

169
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:30,009
but, you guys,

170
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,712
I've seen a lot of messed up stuff.

171
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:35,134
This toxin tore through his body

172
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,183
like it was burning
him from the inside out.

173
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:38,784
I mean, I'm gonna have to reach out

174
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:41,220
to my forensic contacts just
to see if anyone knows anything.

175
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:42,922
Who found the body?

176
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,991
I thought he was just
sleeping it off for once.

177
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,993
I didn't realize he was freakin' dead.

178
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:50,262
Do you know anyone who may
have had a problem with him?

179
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:51,297
No way.

180
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:52,698
We all loved Ricky.

181
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,734
Did you notice anything
strange in the last few days?

182
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:56,202
Any unusual behavior?

183
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:57,071
Like what?

184
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:59,271
Like someone carrying a
small apothecary bottle

185
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:01,173
marked with a skull
and crossbones perhaps?

186
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,008
No, nothing like that.

187
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,311
But Johnny Kane came
by the dorm yesterday.

188
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:07,480
- Mm.
- What, Johnny Kane Johnny Kane?

189
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:08,848
As in the actor Johnny Kane?

190
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,683
Yeah. My mom went pretty nuts

191
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,318
when I told her.

192
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,819
He even signed one of my DVDs.

193
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:15,154
- No.
- Huh.

194
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:18,023
Oh. To Love Is to Die.

195
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,525
(chuckles) Impressive work.

196
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,394
I mean, to be a man playing
a woman playing a man.

197
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:23,028
It's absolutely dizzying.

198
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:25,631
What, should I have said "spoiler"?

199
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,333
TIMMY: Apparently he was here

200
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:28,601
researching a role.

201
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:30,102
Hmm, committed.

202
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:31,437
He's, like, 40 years old, there's no way

203
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,339
he could pull off
playing a college student.

204
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,408
Um, surely you misspoke, Detective.

205
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,609
I mean, Johnny Kane's a spry

206
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,511
and handsome young
man, wouldn't you say?

207
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:40,179
CHLOE: No, he's quite old.
And since when did you become

208
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:41,380
the president of his fan club?

209
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:44,424
Since he just walked in
here wielding a large knife.

210
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:46,950
Am I too late? Is he dead?

211
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:50,022
- Is he dead?
- Freeze. Drop the knife.

212
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:51,824
It's my fault. He's dead because of me.

213
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:52,892
Put down the knife, Johnny.

214
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:53,893
Yes, listen to her, Johnny.

215
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:54,894
She's quite a good shot.

216
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:56,429
You don't understand!

217
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:57,863
I couldn't do what the man said.

218
00:07:57,865 --> 00:07:58,864
What man?

219
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:02,168
The man said he would kill that kid

220
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,069
if I didn't cut my face.

221

222
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:18,636
Mr. Johnny Kane, you're an amazing actor

223
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:22,286
with an impressive library
of films under your belt.

224
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:24,900
Beloved by critics and the public alike.

225
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,190
Many would say

226
00:08:26,192 --> 00:08:29,237
you're at the top of
your profession right now.

227
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:31,195
Which is why it'll be so interesting

228
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:34,532
to see what decision you
make for this experiment.

229
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:35,900
You can either...

230
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:40,872
carve up your own face, or...

231
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:44,375
Rick Cormier, an innocent
freshman at Malibu State,

232
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:46,544
will die of poisoning.

233
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:49,013
You have 24 hours to decide.

234
00:08:49,015 --> 00:08:51,916
Do what's asked and an
antidote will be delivered.

235
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:55,319
The choice is yours alone.

236
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,721
LUCIFER: Well, that's dramatic.

237
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:58,695
When did you get this video?

238
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,391
Yesterday. At first,

239
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:02,927
I thought it was some sick joke.

240
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:06,030
Fans send bizarre letters
to my manager all the time,

241
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:08,466
but this was sent directly
to my personal e-mail,

242
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:10,668
and it was so...

243
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,936
disturbing.

244
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:13,271
I couldn't get it out of my head.

245
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:15,306
- I had to check it out.
- So you went to the school.

246
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:16,374
Yeah, when I realized

247
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:18,409
that this kid was a
real student at Malibu,

248
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:20,211
I... I started thinking

249
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:22,580
that this "experiment"
might be real, too.

250
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:25,716
I went home and I stared
at that knife for hours.

251
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:28,352
But I couldn't do it.

252
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:30,338
I couldn't cut up my face.

253
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,090
LUCIFER: Well, of course you couldn't.

254
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:33,692
That's an impossible choice.

255
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:35,661
This killer is clearly playing God.

256
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:37,263
I mean, no one would
do something like that

257
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:40,066
unless they're being manipulated.

258
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:41,333
(sighs)

259
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:42,568
Not unlike someone

260
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,405
showing affection when
it made no logical sense.

261
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,307
(softly): What?

262
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:49,708
JOHNNY: I mean, what
kind of sick bastard

263
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,943
would do such a thing?

264
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:53,212
That's exactly what I'd like to know.

265
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:55,920
Excuse me.

266
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,610
- (door opens)
- Where are you going?

267
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,686
(door closes)

268
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:02,988
Okay, look, we are
doing everything we can

269
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,324
to trace that e-mail,
but in the meantime,

270
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:07,760
did you have any connection
to the poisoned student?

271
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:09,595
Or any idea why he was targeted?

272
00:10:09,597 --> 00:10:11,964
No, until yesterday I'd never
met him before in my life.

273
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,604
(line ringing, phone ringing)

274
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:25,478
Like that, is it?

275
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:28,881
Excuse us, thank you.

276
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:29,961
Fess up.

277
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:31,477
What did you do to her?

278
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:33,452
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to be more specific.

279
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:35,321
I've done a lot of things
to a lot of people by now.

280
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:38,324
(chuckles) Don't play
silly buggers with me, Mum.

281
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:41,360
The detective kissed me
and I need to know why.

282
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,436
Did you say you kissed?

283
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:45,264
Please spare me the
appearance of surprise

284
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,699
and just tell me how you did it.

285
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,434
Well, I wish I had that
kind of power, but, sadly,

286
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:50,136
I can't take credit.

287
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,707
Why are you so upset?

288
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,910
I assumed you'd be pleased
by such a development.

289
00:10:57,912 --> 00:11:00,246
Well, I...

290
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:03,883
I'm upset because I just
don't know if it's...

291
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:05,384
real.

292
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:07,419
All I can say is,

293
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:09,743
follow your heart, son.

294
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:13,300
These things have a way of
working themselves out in time.

295
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,695
- Really?
- DAN: Hey.

296
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,165
Detective.

297
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,533
- Counselor.
- Douche.

298
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,101
- Dick.
- Well, I suppose

299
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:24,036
that's my cue.

300
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:26,238
Remember what I said, Lucifer.

301
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:30,476
Bye-bye, Daniel.

302
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,447
I just came by to tell you
that Chloe's looking for you.

303
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:37,816
Cyber got a hit off that e-mail trace.

304
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:39,418
Great.

305
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,387
Great.

306

307
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:49,795

309
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:55,000
We traced the e-mail to a grad
student named Matthew Hoffing.

310
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:56,235
He works here part-time.

311
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:58,671
Libraries. Dreary places, aren't they?

312
00:11:58,673 --> 00:12:00,072
They smell like feet.

313
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:02,808
I don't know.

314
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,811
I think they can, uh,
be kind of romantic.

315
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:10,416
Have you ever, you know,
made out in a library?

316
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:12,084
What...

317
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:13,552
Detective, what has
gotten into you today?

318
00:12:13,554 --> 00:12:15,821
This is usually when you
tell me to focus on the work.

319
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:18,529
And yes, of course I've
made out in a library.

320
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:22,117
Right. Yeah, I was-I was...
I've been trying to kind of...

321
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,729
You know what?

322
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:25,687
Never mind. (laughs)

323
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,634
It's definitely not getting
the reaction I was expecting.

324
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:30,002
- Right.
- So, just... no.

325
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:31,036
You know what? No.

326
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:34,579
Since when have you've
been one to avoid sex?

327
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:38,606
(woman screaming)

328
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:41,347
(woman moaning on computer)

329
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:42,948
- What?
- LAPD.

330
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,416
- Show us what's in your hands.
- No,

331
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:46,189
raise your hands above your
head where we can see them.

332
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:48,988
- Well, it might be a gun, Detective.
- It's not a gun.

333
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,457
WOMAN: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:54,393
Just...

335
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:56,228
I don't know any kid...

336
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,797
Ah, ah, ah. Better safe than sorry.

337
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,898
Right.

338
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,600
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

339
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:03,369
I don't know any kid named Rick.

340
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,137
You are Dee-man69, yeah?

341
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:07,273
That's a very clever
play on words, by the way.

342
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:09,441
Was "Nevergetslaid №1" taken?

343
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:13,579
Yes, that's my e-mail, but...

344
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:17,883
I only ever use it for... you know....

345
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:18,651
porn.

346
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:21,453
Care to explain why you sent
Johnny Kane a threatening e-mail

347
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:22,655
yesterday at 9:10 a.m.?

348
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:24,223
LUCIFER: Busted, Mr. Hoffing.

349
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:26,525
You may as well come
clean now. Pun intended.

350
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,927
First off, I'm kind of
a fan of Johnny Kane.

351
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,297
I think he's super talented,
but not enough to e-mail him.

352
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:32,464
And secondly,

353
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:33,799
I couldn't have
e-mailed him at that time

354
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,934
even if I wanted to.
I was T.A.ing a class.

355
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:38,637
- Oh.
- Here, I can prove it.

356
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:43,507
Okay.

357
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:44,642
There is an e-mail there.

358
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:45,976
Oh, wait for it.

359
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:47,044
But it wasn't me.

360
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,379
Do they ever get less predictable?

361
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:50,422
No, I'm serious. It must've been hacked.

362
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,950
I didn't send that e-mail, and
I didn't send this one either.

363
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:55,853
- What other one?
- This one, sent an hour ago.

364
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:57,788
It wasn't me.

365
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:01,625
Dr. Gwendolyn Scott.

366
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:04,328
You're a world-renowned
thoracic surgeon.

367
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,398
Who's saved an awe-inspiring
number of lives.

368
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,167
Which is why it'll be
so interesting to see

369
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:13,571
what decision you make
for this experiment.

370
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:19,543
You can either destroy your hand or...

371
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,512
Ashley Corbett,

372
00:14:21,514 --> 00:14:24,915
an innocent sophomore
at Malibu State, will die

373
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,017
of poisoning.

374
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,653
You have 24 hours to decide.

375
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:32,990
Do what's asked, and an
antidote will be delivered.

376
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:35,860
The choice is yours alone.

377
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:37,632
This isn't just about Johnny Kane.

378
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:40,265
We have to find Ashley Corbett now.

379
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:53,448
CHLOE: Okay, Dan's with Dr. Scott.

380
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:56,482
All we have to do now
is find Ashley Corbett.

381
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:58,016
Look, once we get inside,

382
00:14:58,018 --> 00:14:59,284
let me handle this.

383
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:01,353
Okay, Detective, in order to do so,

384
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:03,489
we need to... blend in.

385
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:05,428
Meaning?

386
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:09,094
Meaning less hall monitor,
more, sort of, hot for teacher.

387
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:10,262
So, do you mind if I...

388
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:12,197
- Thank you.
- Right.

389
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,932
- I got it.
- Well, come on.

390
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:16,702
- You're staring.
- I... fine.

391
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:20,239
(scoffs)

392
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:22,303
Okay.

393
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:26,078
How do I look?

394
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,313

Voilà.

398
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:37,370

engaging in sex, drugs,

408
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:56,508
and lecherous behavior. (chuckles)

409
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,876
Makes me proud.

410
00:15:57,878 --> 00:15:59,645
All right, well, don't
get too comfortable.

411
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:00,913
Remember, we're not here to party,

412
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:02,447
we're here to find Ashley.

413
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:04,316
And she could be sick already,

414
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:07,013
so let's split up and we'll cover
more ground that way.

415
00:16:07,038 --> 00:16:09,888
Right. Find the girl,
don't have fun. Check.

416
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,523

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,730
Excuse me, have you seen this girl?

420
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:20,365
I think I saw her an hour ago.

421
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:23,769
- She's, like, way hot.
- Yeah, great.

422
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:26,171
Uh, do you know where she is?
'Cause she might be in danger.

423
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:28,340
Danger of getting wasted! Whoo!

424
00:16:28,342 --> 00:16:29,608
(laughs)

425
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,777
Ashley Corbett?

426
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:33,846
Anyone seen Ashley Corbett?

427
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:36,648
Uh, Ashley Corbett? No...

428
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,917
- Oh, hello. Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

429
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,219
(laughter)

430
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:42,588
Right, uh, yes, uh,
you're all very lovely.

431
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,556
Very lovely.

432
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:46,024
Dear, how do I turn this thing off?

433
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:47,526
I'm looking for Ashley Corbett.

434
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,496
Uh, can you tell me where she is?

435
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:50,729
We'll tell you.

436
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:53,565
But first you have to
do something for us.

437
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,834
(nervous chuckle)

438
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:58,136
We are almost through, Dr. Scott.

439
00:16:58,138 --> 00:17:00,272
I really appreciate you
answering our questions.

440
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:03,008
Probably should've called
you when I got the e-mail.

441
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,822
I was afraid.

442
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:06,445
It's okay, Doctor.

443
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:07,779
We're here now.

444
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:10,716
Can I ask you something, Detective?

445
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:14,152
What would you do?

446
00:17:14,154 --> 00:17:15,581
If you were me,

447
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:17,623
and it were your hand

448
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,058
or an innocent girl's life?

449
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,227
What would you do?

450
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:27,032
I don't know.

451
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:32,237
I've dedicated my life to saving people.

452
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:35,908
Taken an oath to do no harm.

453
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,644
H-How am I supposed
to make that choice?

454
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:40,913
You don't have to.

455
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:42,848
They've drawn blood
from the first victim

456
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,783
and they're already
working on an antidote.

457
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:47,386
That's great if they find the girl.

458
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:49,655
But what if they can't?

459
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:52,257
They will find her.

460
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,660
I promise you.

461
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:56,528
Some of our best people are on it.

462
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,563

468
00:18:08,342 --> 00:18:09,841
Right. Now,

469
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:12,177
can you please tell me where Ashley is?

470
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,379
Mm. Come with me.

471
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:16,648
Whoa! Hey...

472
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,950
Was that an earthquake,

473
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:19,451
or did you just rock my world?

474
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:21,787
I don't think so.

475
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:22,988

482
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:37,035
how do I know that it's real?

483
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:40,505
It's real if you're
two halves of a whole.

484
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:41,974
If you're stronger together

485
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:43,475
than you are apart.

486
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:46,178

does that actually mean?

488
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:49,314
Damn it, Lucifer, I was so stupid

489
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:50,916
to think I could actually take a leap

490
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:52,052
and trust you for once.

491
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:55,178
I mean, a woman's life is on the
line and here you are doing...

492
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:58,211
Wait, what are you doing?

493
00:18:58,236 --> 00:19:00,659
Well, I was actually working, Detective.

494
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,160
Oh, my God.

495
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:04,062
- Is this her?
- Yes.

496
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:05,630
She's so pretty.

497
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:07,265
- Oh.
- (chuckles)

498
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,935
Well, I-I mean I was
working and maybe, sort of,

499
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:11,770
you know, asking about you.

500
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:13,171
- About me?
- Well, we had some time to kill

501
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:14,606
whilst we're waiting for Ashley.

502
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,608
'Cause apparently
she's in that bathroom.

503
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,244
Don't know what's taking her so long.

504
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:22,314
Ashley Corbett. LAPD.

505
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:23,548
Ashley.

506
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:31,656
It just won't stop.

507
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:34,659
MOM: So, this is where the...

508
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,928
healing happens.

509
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,563
It's cute.

510
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:42,367
So, what brings you here?

511
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:45,937
I have some upsetting
information to give to Lucifer.

512
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:49,241
It's a revelation that
might send him over the edge

513
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:50,275
against his Father.

514
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:52,277
Okay.

515
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,845
But considering

516
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:57,149
that Lucifer and I have
a bumpy track record,

517
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:58,884
I'm afraid he won't believe me.

518
00:19:58,886 --> 00:20:00,786
I'm afraid he might think I have some...

519
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,454
(chuckling): ulterior motive.

520
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:03,889
Do you?

521
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,493
I'm not going to tell him
this information for you,

522
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:09,861
if that's what you're asking.

523
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:14,533
What if I say pretty please, hmm?

524
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:17,967
Apparently that's
supposed to do something.

525
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:20,472
Look, I understand that you have been...

526
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:24,743
Uh, are the goddess of all creation.

527
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:27,245
You're very...

528
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,414
uh, tall.

529
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,450
And most certainly

530
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:32,717
quite powerful.

531
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:36,922
But my loyalties are
to my patient, your son.

532
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:39,558
Doctor-Devil confidentiality.

533
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,927
But I'm not asking
you to break his trust.

534
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:44,563
In fact, I'm asking you to
illuminate the truth for him.

535
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:47,666
If he's going to make an
informed decision about Chlo...

536
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:51,770
...about his future here,

537
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:54,306
he needs to know the facts.

538
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:55,907
(softly): Right?

539
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:58,076
I said please, right?

540
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,680
If this information is as upsetting

541
00:21:01,682 --> 00:21:03,381
as you're making it out to be,

542
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:05,450
I'm not interested in
being the messenger.

543
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:07,519
Afraid I'm too smart for that.

544
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:10,589
So what you're saying is I
need to find someone he'll trust

545
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:13,058
that is foolish enough to
help me deliver the news.

546
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,057
That's the exact opposite
of what I'm suggesting.

547
00:21:16,082 --> 00:21:17,395
Thank you, Doctor.

548
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:20,765
I know just the person.

549
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:23,135
Now I see the resemblance.

550
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,840
All right, well, call me as
soon as you hear anything else.

551
00:21:28,842 --> 00:21:29,908
Thanks.

552
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,876
How is she?

553
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:33,378
- Is she going to be okay?
- They found Ashley.

554
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,547
She's in the hospital.

555
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:37,849
But the poison must be
different from the first victim.

556
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:42,554
The antidote they made,
it's... it's useless.

557
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:45,123
But don't worry, we
will figure out a way.

558
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,424
We always do.

559
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:49,494
It just takes time. Okay?

560
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:54,232
I, um... I need to get a glass of water.

561
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:58,970
(beeps)

562
00:21:58,972 --> 00:22:00,438
This is Espinoza.

563
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,474
I need to get an update
on Ashley Corbett.

564
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:03,909
(grinding, whirring)

565
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:06,311
I'm sorry. Can you say that
again? I can't hear you,

566
00:22:06,313 --> 00:22:07,879
there's a...

567
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:08,914
garbage disposal...

568
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,215
Doc!

569
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:12,517
Don't.

570
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,186
Don't.

571
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:21,914
- (screams)
- DAN: No!

572
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:28,373
We e-mailed back a photo of your hand.

573
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:29,922
Doubt we'll get a response.

574
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:31,624
The killer knows that
we may be monitoring.

575
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:34,026
That poor girl was going to die.

576
00:22:34,028 --> 00:22:35,127
I had no choice.

577
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:37,043
LUCIFER: Oh, don't be ridiculous.

578
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:39,564
You had a choice not to be so foolish.

579
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:40,233
Lucifer.

580
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,901
Well, who's to say the killer wouldn't

581
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,169
demand her other hand?

582
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:44,770
Her spleen? Her heart?

583
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:46,505
'Cause, believe me, there is no winning

584
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:49,208
when you play by a
twisted tyrant's rules.

585
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,611
Excuse me. Can I talk
to you for a second?

586
00:22:51,613 --> 00:22:54,180
(exhales)

587
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:56,746
You are out of line.

588
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:57,884
Me?

589
00:22:57,886 --> 00:23:00,052
The doctor just destroyed her hand.

590
00:23:00,054 --> 00:23:02,054
When are people going to understand?

591
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:04,557
Thou shalt not negotiate
with terrorists!

592
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,837
Oh, surely you can see
this is a fool's game.

593
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:09,973
The only thing I can see is,
you are letting your emotions

594
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:13,366
get away from you. We can't
let our feelings get in the way

595
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:15,047
of our work, Lucifer.

596
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:16,971
We have to work together as a team,

597
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:19,006
or else someone could get hurt.

598
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:21,976
Yes.

599
00:23:21,978 --> 00:23:24,745
Yes, I suppose they could.

600
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:27,181
MESSENGER: Hello?

601
00:23:27,183 --> 00:23:30,951
I've got a delivery for a Dr. Scott.

602
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:33,821
Uh, I'll take that. LAPD.

603
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:35,422
CHLOE: Thanks.

604
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,630
"I'm a man of my word."

605
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:48,903
The antidote.

606
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,138
We need to test this
and get it to Ashley now.

607
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,306
Right.

608
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:00,447
Boo-yah.

609
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:02,116
Remember how I sent a
shout-out to my peeps

610
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:03,884
- for other poison victims?
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:07,054
Well, meet Monsieur John Doe.

612
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:09,690
Now, according to my buddy at DHS,

613
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:12,326
this guy was found in the cargo
hold of a plane in Chicago.

614
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:14,829
Similar symptoms to our poison vic.

615
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:17,431
And get this, the flight he was on?

616
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:19,033
Came out of Los Angeles.

617
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:20,700
So, he might actually
be the first victim?

618
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,880
Mm-hmm. I mean, the only difference

619
00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:25,673
is he has hot spots all over
him, almost like the poison...

620
00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:27,007
Spilled on him.

621
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:28,342
Exactly.

622
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:31,946
But this stuff is so strong,
Dan, that it killed him anyway.

623
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:34,081
I mean, we are talking

624
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,050
designer poison here.

625
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:39,154
Engineered from controlled substances.

626
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,188
Each one just a little bit different.

627
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,506
So, how do we get an antidote?

628
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,592
Well, that right there
is the tricky part.

629
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:47,661
Designer poisons need
designer antidotes.

630
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:50,764
This guy, our killer, is really good.

631
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:52,466
I mean, bad.

632
00:24:52,468 --> 00:24:56,203
But really good.

633
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:57,538
Oh, my God.

634
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,739
I know.

635
00:24:58,741 --> 00:25:01,775
It's tough. But we'll
get through this, buddy.

636
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:05,446
No. No, that photo. Hold on one second.

637
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:07,581
Where is it?

638
00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:14,922
What?

639
00:25:14,924 --> 00:25:17,691
The same birthmark.

640
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:19,793
Your dead guy from Chicago

641
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,455
is Andy Kleinberg.

642
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,163
The rich guy that we
looked into for the murder

643
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:24,265
of that stewardess.

644
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,834
We were searching for
a... a special package

645
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:28,435
that was smuggled into the country,

646
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:30,371
- Okay.
- We never found it.

647
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:31,639
It had to be the poison.

648
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:33,361
Kleinberg must've been
the one who stole it.

649
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,267
And look what happened to him.

650
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:43,350
ASHLEY: This is the other
student that was poisoned?

651
00:25:43,352 --> 00:25:45,352
I'm sorry.

652
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:46,954
I don't recognize him.

653
00:25:46,956 --> 00:25:49,590
It's okay. We just need
to ask you these questions

654
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:50,824
now that you're feeling better.

655
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:53,294
Yes. Now that your inside's
no longer bleeding out.

656
00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:54,395
CHLOE: Do you have any idea, Ashley,

657
00:25:54,397 --> 00:25:56,196
when you could've been
poisoned yesterday?

658
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:58,799
No. I mean, it was a normal day.

659
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:01,644
I woke up. I had a bio exam.

660
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:03,837
Lunch at the dorms...

661
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,006
Then I just, I went to the
gym, I couldn't even work out

662
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:07,775
'cause my arm was kind of sore.

663
00:26:07,777 --> 00:26:09,476
Why was your arm sore?

664
00:26:09,478 --> 00:26:11,145
ASHLEY: I don't know.

665
00:26:11,147 --> 00:26:14,315
Uh, I guess, 'cause of
the flu shot that I got?

666
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:16,050
Do you think that could have been it?

667
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:18,123
CHLOE: So, according to the M.E. report,

668
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:19,764
the other kid got a flu shot, too.

669
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:21,488
Ah. Well, what do you know?

670
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,157
Ashley, where did you get the shot?

671
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,192
The university health van.

672
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:26,193
Great. Thank you.

673
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:27,995
- Yes.
- (clears throat)

674
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:30,631
- Excuse me.
- Get well soon.

675
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:31,665
(beeps)

676
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,400
DAN: The guy who gave the flu shots

677
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:34,568
was Dr. Jason Carlisle.

678
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,450
This is footage of a
car accident he was in.

679
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:42,710
He was a professor at Malibu
until this video went viral.

680
00:26:42,712 --> 00:26:44,678
No!

681
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:47,381
Want to know why?

682
00:26:47,383 --> 00:26:49,383
Because the poor sap saved himself?

683
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:51,585
Correction. Because he saved
the dissertation he'd been

684
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:53,921
working on for four years,
while an innocent college student

685
00:26:53,923 --> 00:26:55,622
working as an Uber driver died.

686
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:57,257
He was publicly humiliated,
his wife left him,

687
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:00,661
he lost his job, his entire
world spiraled out of control.

688
00:27:00,663 --> 00:27:02,496
So he took a job as
a mobile health tech.

689
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:04,898
I thought our killer
was just raving mad,

690
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,600
but he's trying to prove a bloody point.

691
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:09,236
That everyone would make
the same choice he did.

692
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:11,672
Saving their livelihood
over someone else's life.

693
00:27:11,674 --> 00:27:12,973
Johnny Kane's face is
his bread and butter,

694
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:14,508
and so is the surgeon's hand.

695
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,377
So he's recreating
his own moral dilemma.

696
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:18,078
He's picking everyone by design...

697
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,247
- The kids, the professionals...
- And he's not done.

698
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:21,782
Unis searched the professor's house.

699
00:27:21,784 --> 00:27:24,885
They found files on over
a dozen possible targets.

700
00:27:24,887 --> 00:27:27,547
Okay. Well, we need to find him
or else we need to figure out

701
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:29,251
a way to draw him out carefully.

702
00:27:29,276 --> 00:27:31,168
Or we could just get a big stick

703
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:33,160
and poke the bear as hard as we can.

704
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:34,056
What does that mean?

705
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:36,463
LUCIFER: Well, this man
clearly has an oversized ego,

706
00:27:36,465 --> 00:27:39,333
comparing himself to the likes
of Johnny Kane and Dr. Scott.

707
00:27:39,335 --> 00:27:42,302
If we threaten that ego,
trust me, he'll respond.

708
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:43,370
How do you know?

709
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:45,039
Because I know his type, Daniel.

710
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,840
Used to live with him, in fact.

711
00:27:46,842 --> 00:27:48,575
Called him Dad.

712
00:27:53,392 --> 00:27:55,049
What are you doing?

713
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:57,051
(typing)

714
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:58,552
What are you doing, Detective?

715
00:27:58,554 --> 00:27:59,987
Sending him an e-mail.

716
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:01,622
- (laughs)
- What?

717
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:03,457
LUCIFER: "You pathetic sad sack,

718
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:05,559
"no wonder you didn't get tenure,

719
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:07,428
your experiments are
as ugly as you are."

720
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,962
Well said, Detective.

721
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:11,031
DAN: Seriously? Insulting
the serial killer?

722
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,399
That's an awesome idea.

723
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,400
Thank you.

724
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:15,202
Also, his mask is a bit lame.

725
00:28:15,204 --> 00:28:17,204
Could be much creepier. Put that in.

726
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,308
DAN: Chloe. Don't send this.
All right? It's not you.

727
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,177
This is... This is, it's a rash move.

728
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:25,212
(continues typing)

729
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:26,947
(taps key)

730
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:28,582
DAN: That's great.

731
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:30,250
I mean, what could go wrong, right?

732
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:32,386
I mean, surely this won't
force the psycho underground,

733
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:34,088
it won't cause him to
do anything crazy...

734
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,189
Chill out, Dan.

735
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:36,290
(computer chimes)

736
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:39,445
He responded.

737
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,803
Ah, told you.

738
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:43,964
With a link.

739
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:47,434
Hello, Detective.

740
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:51,171
You don't need that mask
anymore, Professor Carlisle.

741
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:52,473
(exhales sharply)

742
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:57,878
(inhales, exhales)

743
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,546
Ah.

744
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:02,516
So much easier to breathe
without that thing.

745
00:29:03,752 --> 00:29:05,719
What do you want, Professor?

746
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:09,590
What do I want? To finish my
experiment without interference,

747
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:11,158
but here we are...

748
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,198
LUCIFER: Your experiment
failed, Professor.

749
00:29:13,223 --> 00:29:14,428
We proved your theory wrong.

750
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,530
The doctor chose to save
the girl. So, clearly,

751
00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:18,966
not everyone's as egregiously
selfish as you are.

752
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:22,503
I am not a selfish person.
I was vilified for doing

753
00:29:22,505 --> 00:29:25,434
what anyone in my position would do.

754
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:27,975
You went back for your computer.
That's not about survival,

755
00:29:27,977 --> 00:29:29,409
that's about stuff.

756
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:32,346
It was about instinct, but thank you

757
00:29:32,348 --> 00:29:34,882
for reminding me why I'm doing this

758
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:36,850
and for helping me

759
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:39,953
to improve upon my experiment.

760
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:41,755
Truth is, Dr. Scott

761
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:44,925
only mutilated her hand
because she was being observed

762
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:46,460
by you.

763
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:50,154
So this time I'm
controlling my variables.

764
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:55,068
Meet...

765
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,538
Benjamin Tibi.

766
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,574
Innocent student,
attached to a poison drip.

767
00:30:00,576 --> 00:30:02,976
And here, Leon Klem,

768
00:30:02,978 --> 00:30:06,446
accomplished track
star, stuck in a vice.

769
00:30:06,448 --> 00:30:09,149
If Leon simply pulls the lever

770
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:13,053
and severs his leg within 60 minutes,

771
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:14,288
Benji here

772
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,957
gets... this.

773
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:19,326
You guessed it.

774
00:30:19,328 --> 00:30:21,195
The antidote.

775
00:30:21,197 --> 00:30:24,801
Oh, and please, for your sake...

776
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:27,668
don't waste your time
trying to make another.

777
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,937
They're all unique,

778
00:30:29,939 --> 00:30:32,639
and the only place the formula lives

779
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:34,241
is right here,

780
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:36,343
in my head.

781
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:39,880
Not bad for a sad sack

782
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:42,216
who couldn't get tenure, huh?

783
00:30:43,078 --> 00:30:44,678
CHLOE: Professor, wait!

784
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:48,622
Well.

785
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:50,891
Bear officially poked.

786
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,833
You have two minutes. Talk.

787
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,569
It's simple. There's something
Lucifer needs to know.

788
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:14,907
I think you should tell him.

789
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:17,257
Oh, really? And why's that?

790
00:31:17,282 --> 00:31:19,252
Because it's about his beloved Chloe.

791
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,111
He'll take it better from
you. You're his closest friend.

792
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:25,247
Lucifer may be stubborn,
but he listens to you.

793
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:26,882
Mm-hmm. Hate to break it to you,

794
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:29,185
but if you're buttering
me up, it ain't gonna work.

795
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,620
You have bad news to give your son?

796
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:33,222
Suck it up

797
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,790
and do it yourself.

798
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,359
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

799
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:38,627
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

800
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:40,029
Good talk.

801
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,764
God made Chloe.

802
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,099
Yeah.

803
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:45,367
He kind of made them all.

804
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:47,803
No. Chloe wasn't supposed to be here.

805
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,505
God put her in Lucifer's path.

806
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,006
She's a...

807
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:52,541
miracle.

808
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,577
(laughs)

809
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,779
(claps hands)

810
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,381
Granny Panties Decker? A miracle?

811
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:00,816
Please.

812
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,185
35 years ago,

813
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,921
Amenadiel was sent to this
bar, where he sat down,

814
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,324
had a chat, then blessed Penelope Decker

815
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,860
so that she and her
husband could have a child.

816
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,294
That child

817
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:13,729
is Lucifer's partner.

818
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:16,131
It's no accident that they met.

819
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:20,069
Mm. So, what, Amenadiel
blessed Penelope's lady parts?

820
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,137
Wait, is Amenadiel

821
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,906
Chloe Decker's daddy?

822
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,842
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

823
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,445
Think...

824
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,747
about it.

825
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,383
Haven't you ever wondered
why that particular human

826
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,252
makes him vulnerable?

827
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,587
Mm.

828
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,523
But if you still don't believe me,

829
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,825
there's something you should see.

830
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,266
No luck. I called every lab

831
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,700
the professor's ever
been affiliated with...

832
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:53,135
No one's seen him.

833
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,570
He could have built that lab anywhere,

834
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,839
and the video link was untraceable.

835
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,374
What if I made a mistake?

836
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,608
What if by sending that e-mail

837
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,410
I just sped up his timeline?

838
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,678
There's two lives on the line here.

839
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,712
Two lives that you're going to save,

840
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:05,548
- Detective, I know you will.
- Exactly.

841
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,418
- Found something.
- Please tell me it's good news.

842
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,787
Eh, more like medium news.

843
00:33:11,812 --> 00:33:13,824
So, Kleinberg's autopsy came back.

844
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:15,735
Turns out he didn't die of poisoning.

845
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,059
I mean, he would have died of poisoning,

846
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,727
except he was strangled.

847
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:20,129
Impatient little killer.

848
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,031
Since I finally got time of death right,

849
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,365
I was able to ping

850
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,034
Kleinberg's cell to Van Nuys Airport,

851
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,770
where I got this.

852
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,872
CHLOE: It's the professor, clear as day.

853
00:33:29,897 --> 00:33:31,870
So we can assume that
he killed Kleinberg.

854
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:34,777
Right. But this only tells us
where the professor was.

855
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,945
It doesn't tell us

856
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,247
where he actually is,
hence "medium" news.

857
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,516
Uh, can you rewind it to the part

858
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,484
where he goes through security?

859
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:44,753
Why, what are you looking for?

860
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:46,375
CHLOE: Okay, freeze there.

861
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,591
And then zoom in on the tray.

862
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,093
Looks like a key card with a logo.

863
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,227
ELLA: Oh, definitely a bird.

864
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:53,609
School mascot maybe?

865
00:33:53,634 --> 00:33:55,864
We checked every lab at Malibu State.

866
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:57,633
LUCIFER: Well, he wouldn't
go back there, would he?

867
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,069
Trust me, when you get
kicked out of a fancy party,

868
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,670
the last thing you want
to do is sneak back in.

869
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,440
You do the opposite.

870
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,108
Who's Malibu's closest rival?

871
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,315
<i>CHLOE: The lab in here
is closed for renovation,</i>

872
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,673
<i>so maybe he's here.</i>

873
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:27,291
Well, well, isn't this a surprise.

874
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:28,764
(door rattles)

875
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,740
It's locked, Detective.

876
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:34,269
But with that said, I'm
actually glad you made it.

877
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:36,372
Why, because you'd like to surrender?

878
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:39,041
It's a bit anticlimactic,
but very well, we accept.

879
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:43,679
No, because now you get to see firsthand

880
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,748
what I'm trying to prove.

881
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,549
CHLOE: It's over, Professor.

882
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:51,086
Afraid you're wrong about that.

883
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,489
(gunshot)

884
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,190
Acrylic glass, Detective.

885
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:57,772
Please don't kill yourself
with your own bullet.

886
00:34:57,797 --> 00:34:59,495
We wouldn't be able to conduct

887
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,530
the final part of this experiment.

888
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:04,233
Time for you to make a choice.

889
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:09,138
In this vial, an antidote
that will save Benji's life.

890
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,507
<i>In vial numero dos,</i>

891
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,109
poisonous gas that will kill you

892
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,411
if you enter the room.

893
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,980
Simple, really... You decide

894
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,149
what's more important.

895
00:35:25,212 --> 00:35:26,384
No.

896
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:46,123
- W-W-W-What are you doing?
- If I don't get in that room right now,

897
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:47,155
that kid is gonna die.

898
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:48,356
Word of advice, Detective.

899
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:50,558
If you go into that room
right now, you'll die.

900
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,759
What are we supposed to do?

901
00:35:53,476 --> 00:35:55,309
- I can save him.
- What?

902
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:57,499
But in order to do so, you
need to go after the professor

903
00:35:57,501 --> 00:35:59,000
right now, before it's too late.

904
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:00,368
- What?
- I promise you

905
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,403
I can get to that antidote
without harming myself.

906
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:04,539
- How?
- We don't have time to explain.

907
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,541
Do you trust me?

908
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:09,277
- Yes.
- Then go.

909
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:11,981
Go!

910
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:26,094
Freeze!

911
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:29,197
- (grunts)
- (screams)

912
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,899
Right.

913
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:32,133
(coughs)

914
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:39,774
Okay.

915
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,777
Oh!

916
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,949
- (grunts)
- (indistinct chatter)

917
00:36:48,618 --> 00:36:50,151
(both grunt)

918
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:53,713
(yells)

919
00:36:59,696 --> 00:37:02,163
Oh, come on, Detective,
a bit of help here!

920
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:04,199
I need you further away.

921
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:11,873
Freeze!

922
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:15,343
There's nowhere left to run, Professor.

923
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,434
(laughs cynically)

924
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:33,394
(inhales deeply)

925
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:35,530
(exhales)

926
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:38,566
Lovely.

927
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,343
I knew you'd save yourself.

928
00:37:49,246 --> 00:37:51,479
It was the only choice you could make.

929
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:53,514
Put down the knife.

930
00:37:53,516 --> 00:37:55,550
It's not too late.

931
00:37:55,575 --> 00:37:57,703
You can still make a different choice.

932
00:37:58,788 --> 00:38:00,555
The right choice.

933
00:38:00,557 --> 00:38:02,523
You can still save that kid back there.

934
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:06,261
You still don't get it.

935
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:08,477
I didn't want anyone to get hurt,

936
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:11,099
but I needed people to understand

937
00:38:11,101 --> 00:38:16,104
I'm not a monster, I'm human.

938
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:18,973
You call it biology, call it God,

939
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:22,610
but choice is an illusion.

940
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:24,379
I didn't have one

941
00:38:24,381 --> 00:38:28,383
when I pulled myself
out of that burning car.

942
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:32,120
And I certainly don't have one now.

943
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:36,895
You'll understand soon enough.

944
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:54,809
Where is he?

945
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:57,412
Where is Lucifer?

946
00:38:57,414 --> 00:38:59,255
I'm right here, Detective.

947
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:03,818
See? I told you everything
would be all right.

948
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:10,825
I'm so glad you're okay.

949

950
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,930
Hey.

951
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:19,901
I guess we make a good
team after all, don't we?

952
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,474

Why don't you have a seat, Lucifer.

963

There's something that
we need to tell you.

964
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:10,785
Ooh, some sort of supernatural
intervention, is it?

965
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:11,719
(chuckles)

966
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:13,287
Well, doesn't matter what shenanigans

967
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:14,322
you two have got cooking up,

968
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:16,157
'cause, quite frankly, I'm too happy

969
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,458
for you to spoil things.

970
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,127
- Happy?
- Yeah.

971
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:22,363
The detective and I... Sorry...

972
00:40:22,365 --> 00:40:24,966
Chloe and I are real.

973
00:40:24,968 --> 00:40:27,602
I mean, I didn't think it could happen,

974
00:40:27,604 --> 00:40:31,372
but it has, and I've got
this overwhelming sensation...

975
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:33,908
I can't even describe it, but...

976
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,411
I feel invincible.

977
00:40:36,413 --> 00:40:39,291
So come on, ladies, bring it on.

978
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:42,818
Whatever it is, I'm
sure I can deal with it.

979
00:40:44,189 --> 00:40:46,656
Forget it. Come on.

980
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:47,955
What?

981
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:49,690
There's nothing to talk about.

982
00:40:49,692 --> 00:40:51,859
- What? I've only just got here.
- Go. Go.

983
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:53,694
We discussed this, Mazikeen.

984
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:57,231
No. You discussed this.

985
00:40:57,233 --> 00:41:00,001
And I don't want to have
anything to do with it anymore.

986
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:01,369
I thought you understood.

987
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:03,938

989
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:09,243
Or are you trying to
get back at your ex?

990
00:41:09,245 --> 00:41:10,678
MOM: You don't know what
you're talking about.

991
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,280
I knew

992
00:41:12,282 --> 00:41:15,416
- you were up to something.
- What the hell is this?

993
00:41:15,418 --> 00:41:18,939
What's Amenadiel doing with Chloe's mum?

994
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:23,491

Don't toy with me, Mother.

996
00:41:26,763 --> 00:41:28,282
What is this?

997
00:41:28,307 --> 00:41:31,308
I've been trying to find
the right way to tell you.
