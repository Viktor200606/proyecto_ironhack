00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:04,272
("Vehicle" by
Ides of March playing)

2
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:19,653
* Hey, well, I'm the friendly
stranger in the black sedan *

3
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,389
* Won't you hop inside my car?

4
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,557
* I got pictures, got candy,
I'm a lovable man *

5
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,626
* And I can take you
to the nearest star *

6
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,362
* I'm your vehicle, baby

7
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:31,132
* I'll take you anywhere
you wanna go *

8
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,134
* I'm your vehicle, woman

9
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,669
* By now I'm sure you know

10
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,138
* That I love ya
* Love ya *

11
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,272
* I need ya
* Need ya *

12
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:40,841
* I want you,
got to have you, child *

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,210
* Great God in heaven

14
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:45,513
* You know I love you...

15
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,217
What, have I mussed
my suit again?

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,085
It's impossible
to keep clean, this thing.

17
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,321
You have wings.

18
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,723
Ah. Right, yes, forgot.

19
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,826
Bit of a conversation-stopper
for you humans, isn't it?

20
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,761
(sighs)

21
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,196
There we go. That better?

22
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,198
Ah. (chuckles)

23
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,600
You take care.

24
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,769
All right.

25
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,171
Nice suit.

26
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,173
Oh, well, thank you very much.

27
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,307
My grandpa had one just like it.

28
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,743
Grandfather? But...
Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,512
This was the height of fashion
last time I visited.

30
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,448
Hmm. You here for business
or pleasure?

31
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,649
Oh, pleasure.

32
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,184
Always pleasure.

33
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:26,120
Oh, then you came
to the right place.

34
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:28,889
* White brother...

35
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,458
*

36
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,092
(women laughing)

37
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,175
ALL (chanting): Off! Off! Off!
Off! Off! Off! Off!

38
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,609
(chuckles):
Mm!

39
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,780
(groans)

40
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:53,781
How can someone

41
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:54,915
who can literally
control time

42
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,252
have such atrocious timing?

43
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,821
Toying with
humans again, I see.

44
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,192
Oh, these poor creatures.

45
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,859
They know not what they do.

46
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:06,960
I beg to differ.

47
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,663
Everyone here is well aware
that they're doing me.

48
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,299
Enough foolishness.

49
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,534
It's time for me
to take you back to Hell.

50
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,702
As always.

51
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:18,672
Correction: allow you
to take me back, as always.

52
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:19,740
Please.

53
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,776
Everyone knows I'm the strongest
of God's children.

54
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,246
Uh, not everybody.

55
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,281
I mean, you've never fought me,
have you, huh?

56
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:28,449
Care to give it a try?

57
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,184
You know damn well
that celestial beings

58
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:32,253
aren't allowed to
interact here on Earth.

59
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,721
Now, let's go.
(sighs)

60
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,890
It's dangerous for humanity
to be exposed to divinity.

61
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,526
Well, I wouldn't
sit on that couch--

62
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,494
left a lot of divinity there.

63
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:43,231
Enough!

64
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,199
Now, you can either
deal with me,

65
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,768
or you can deal with Father.

66
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,806
Yeah.

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,575
That's what I thought.

68
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,210
Very well.

69
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,212
Well, at least allow me
to say my good-byes.

70
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:01,249
I mean, that's just manners,
isn't it? Not that you'd know.

71
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,783
Ten minutes.

72
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,289
(whispers):
Right.

73
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,830
Nice dress.

74
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,931
It's a robe.

75
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,267
You wear it well.

76
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,504
Humans.

77
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,441
(three gunshots)

78
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,283
What are you looking at?
Nothing.

79
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,285
I'm just...

80
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:49,763
(gasps)

81
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,732
(panting)

82
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,271
My necklace.

83
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,407
*

84
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:16,285
LUCIFER: And this little demon
went, "Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee,"

85
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,621
all into the valley of sin.

86
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:19,455
(laughs)

87
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,923
There's been a change
of plans, Luci.

88
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:21,658
Oh, G...

89
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:26,530
Oh. Not what I expected,
but, uh,

90
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:28,298
all right, fine, have fun.

91
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:29,866
Just go in the other room.

92
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:33,637
Or not.

93
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,639
Sorry, are you going somewhere?

94
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:40,477
Uh... listen,
I have an errand to run.

95
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,312
Why are there holes
in your dress?

96
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:42,947
It's a robe.

97
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,780
Oh, I apologize.

98
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:45,515
Why are there holes
in your dress?

99
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:49,219
Look, I don't trust you to see
yourself back to Hell, okay?

100
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:51,889
So I want you to stay here
for a few hours,

101
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:52,890
and then we'll go.

102
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:55,092
Oh. More time in L.A.

103
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,127
Lucky me. (chuckles)

104
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:04,434
You see, I respect
the rule of human law,

105
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:06,203
which is why
I'm seeking your assistance

106
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:08,105
in a matter
of utmost importance.

107
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:09,974
A robbery has occurred.

108
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,080
Okay.

109
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:17,482
What was stolen?

110
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,484
My necklace.

111
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:21,386
The estimated value?

112
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,754
It's hard to say,
really, uh...

113
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:27,658
It's not of this world,
so there's that.

114
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:30,895
Priceless beyond measure.

115
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:33,030
I'll just put down $40.

116
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:34,532
Where did the incident occur?

117
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:37,101
In an alleyway south of
"Cahunana" and Franklin.

118
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:38,102
Cahuenga?

119
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:39,737
"Cahunana" and Franklin.

120
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:42,540
Now, this thief
was armed,

121
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:45,643
and, oh, yes, uh,
I made a rendering.

122
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:49,780
And I do believe that this
should help you with your quest.

123
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:51,516
Okay.

124
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:58,122
So a jack-o'-lantern
stole your necklace?

125
00:05:58,155 --> 00:06:00,791
So you know this man?

126
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:03,628
Where can I find
this Mr. O'Lantern?

127
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,064
Did Paolucci put you up to this?

128
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:10,034
You know it's a crime
to file a false report, right?

129
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:14,138
You think I would lie?

130
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:16,941
What?
(phone ringing)

131
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:18,108
Sorry, excuse me.

132
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:19,644
Just two seconds.

133
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:21,812
Hey, honey, what's up?

134
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,581
DAN:
I'm not gonna make date night.

135
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:24,682
Oh, that's all right.

136
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:26,817
My mom just called,
and she has to shoot tonight,

137
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:29,420
so she can't watch
Trixie anyhow.

138
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:30,521
Well, I'm gonna be home
pretty late.

139
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:31,656
You want me to pick up
some dinner?

140
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,758
No, that's okay. There's stuff
for tacos in the fridge,

141
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,825
and we'll make it a thing.

142
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:35,960
We'll call it "Taco Tuesday."

143
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:36,961
Trixie will love it.

144
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:38,629
Cool.

145
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:39,797
So, what are you doing?

146
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,732
I caught a body
on Franklin and Cahuenga.

147
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:42,567
Really?

148
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,502
That's so weird;
a guy just came in,

149
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:45,836
reporting a mugging near there.

150
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,073
I wonder if it has
anything to do...

151
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,609
with your homicide.

152
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,078
Lucifer.

153
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:55,513
(groans)

154
00:06:55,546 --> 00:06:58,182
If only angels came
with a snooze button.

155
00:06:58,215 --> 00:06:59,950
What? What is
it, Brother?

156
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:02,820
A human shot me
and stole my necklace.

157
00:07:02,853 --> 00:07:07,024
Well, so much for not exposing
humanity to our divinity.

158
00:07:07,057 --> 00:07:09,894
Which is why I need
to get it back, all right?

159
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,596
Oh.

160
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:13,698
Now, I tried to utilize
human law enforcement,

161
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,100
but it failed, so...

162
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,603
(sighs)

163
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:21,672
...I need
your help, Luci.

164
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:24,542
(chuckles)
Oh, do you now?

165
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:30,014
Well, you've always
been crafty...

166
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,516
smart...

167
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,618
Craftier,
smarter than you.

168
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:35,486
Yes, and
more handsome.

169
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,787
Go on.

170
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:39,790
And because you've spent
more time with humanity,

171
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:41,759
you may understand them
better than I do.

172
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:45,195
Well, most of that time, I was
naked, but true nonetheless.

173
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,965
Luci, are you gonna
help me or not?

174
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:49,534
Hmm.

175
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:50,701
Okay.

176
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:54,104
But you have
to follow me.

177
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:56,106
*

178
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:25,736
(siren whooping)

179
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,738
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

180
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,108
Detective Espinoza.

181
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:33,544
Excuse me.

182
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:34,745
Officer Decker.

183
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:35,746
Hi.
Hi.

184
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,648
How's it going?

185
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:40,985
Dan, not at work, remember?

186
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:41,952
Sorry.

187
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:42,987
Hey, remember the, uh, robbery

188
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,122
I told you about,
happened around the corner?

189
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:45,790
Yeah.

190
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,258
Um, so I searched the area,

191
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,727
and I found this.

192
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,829
It looks like a key fob.

193
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:54,264
I don't know to what, but it
looks like there's blood on it,

194
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:57,001
and... do you think this could
be connected to your homicide?

195
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:58,803
Could be,
but even if it is,

196
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,005
all signs point to
a random attacker.

197
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:03,107
A serial mugger
on a spree.
Hmm.

198
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,011
Looks like my guy resisted
and ended up dead.

199
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:08,679
That's the guy
that got mugged?
Yeah.

200
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,180
He's built like a tank.
Yeah.

201
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:12,883
And so is the guy that
reported the robbery.

202
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,852
They're the last two guys
that I'd try to mug.
Yeah.

203
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:18,723
Yeah, well, a gun can be
a pretty great equalizer.

204
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,859
I don't think
this was random, Dan.

205
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:24,161
Okay, I'll look
into it, but...

206
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:26,631
only when I'm done;
it's gonna be a while.

207
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,065
Okay, why don't I
get a jump on it?

208
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:29,366
No.

209
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,336
Dan, you said to make detective,

210
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:33,904
I have to
show initiative, right?

211
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:36,841
Right. Right.
Mm-hmm.

212
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:40,377
Let me know what you hear,
Officer Decker.

213
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,747
(piano playing jazz music)

214
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,248
Oh, lovely.

215
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:48,719
(chuckles)
Amazing.

216
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,855
Does no one work in this town?

217
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:53,090
Is this where thieves come
to spend their spoils

218
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:54,692
on wine and women?

219
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:56,026
Something like that, yeah.

220
00:09:57,427 --> 00:10:00,297
Oh. Brother, listen to that.

221
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,700
Oh.

222
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:05,736
I haven't heard music
like that since...

223
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,071
well, since
the Silver City.

224
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:09,073
What, there's
no music in Hell?

225
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:11,909
Only for torture,
and usually out of tune.

226
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:14,879
Lately, we've been playing music
by this chap named Bieber.

227
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:16,046
Gosh, you should
hear the screams.

228
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,116
Why don't you go and, um,
grab us a couple of drinks,

229
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:21,285
and I'll do some
reconnaissance.

230
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,122
*

231
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,327
Do you take requests?

232
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,129
What do you want to hear?

233
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:34,665
Uh, myself.

234
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,300
Thank you.

235
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:40,170
(sighs)

236
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,039
(playing David Bowie's
"Changes")

237
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:50,815
You didn't come here
to find this thief, did you?

238
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:53,150
You're just trying to stall
your return to Hell.

239
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:55,686
Oh, I really hoped to get
a few more drinks in

240
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,887
before you worked that one out.

241
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:58,956
Luci, this isn't some game.

242
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:01,225
Now, how many times
do I have to tell you?

243
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,027
Humanity should not
be exposed to...

244
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,895
It's just a necklace,
for crying out loud.

245
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:06,230
You promised me
that you would help.

246
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:09,099
And I am by distracting you
from the painful reality

247
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,235
that you're never
going to find it.

248
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,773
(resumes playing "Changes")

249
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:19,009
TV REPORTER:
...found earlier today
near Cahuenga and Franklin.

250
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:21,712
The police have identified
the murder victim

251
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,914
as MMA fighter Aiden Scott.

252
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:27,084
Scott's body was found
this morning,

253
00:11:27,117 --> 00:11:29,186
the victim of
an apparent shooting.

254
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:30,788
Luci, look.

255
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:32,122
His family has been notified.

256
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:35,092
Born in Lancaster, California,

257
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,427
Aiden Scott moved
to Los Angeles...

258
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:38,729
What?

259
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:40,731
I know this man.

260
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:43,934
Uh, the runner,
right before the theft.

261
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:46,236
What, you think he had
something to do with it?

262
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,437
Exactly, Brother.

263
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:50,307
Whoever killed this Aiden Scott
must also be the same thief

264
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,344
who tried to kill me,
and then took my necklace.

265
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:56,413
The LAPD currently
have no leads.

266
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:57,948
How are we gonna find him

267
00:11:57,982 --> 00:11:59,950
if his own kind
can't even locate him?

268
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:01,952
Which is why I
recommend drinking.

269
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:03,387
TV REPORTER:
Coming up,

270
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,490
we will learn more
about the life of Aiden Scott

271
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:08,959
and who he left behind.
We'll talk to some of...

272
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,361
Actually, do you know,
I think I might be able

273
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:13,197
to help you, Brother,
but I'm gonna need

274
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,299
more than a few extra
hours here on Earth.

275
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:18,702
Name your price.

276
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:23,908
Ooh, well, I can't actually
think of anything right now,

277
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:25,976
so how about a blank check,

278
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,245
cashed at a time of my choosing?

279
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:30,781
Agreed.

280
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:33,017
Well, say it properly.

281
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,253
Say it.

282
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:39,256
Deal.

283
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:41,291
Deal.

284
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:42,492
Right, come on.

285
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,395
Okay, how about that one?

286
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:48,265
Too douchey.

287
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:49,399
Too hick.

288
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,802
Ah.

289
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:53,904
Hello.

290
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,540
Don't you need some sort
of key to start it?

291
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,408
(engine starts, revs)

292
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,477
You know me, Brother.

293
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,012
I can turn anything on.

294
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:04,248
*

295
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:07,384
* So w-w-watch me
t-t-take it away *

296
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:10,154
* Watch me take it away
(engine revs)

297
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:11,021
* So watch me take it away...

298
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:12,522
(tires screech,
metal clanks on ground)

299
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:14,024
(chuckles)

300
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:18,162
Obviously, "R" is for reverse,
not "really fast."

301
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:20,230
* Watch me take it away
(Lucifer shouts)

302
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:21,365
* Watch me take it away.

303
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:30,304
*

304
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:42,950
(sighs) Hello.

305
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:44,385
What's going on here?

306
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,320
Uh, well, Brother,

307
00:13:46,353 --> 00:13:48,890
when a man and a woman
really care about each other,

308
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:50,424
they do a special cuddle
for the cameras,

309
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:51,926
which they sell
for money.

310
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,094
Luci, I know what porn is.

311
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:54,595
Oh, do you now?

312
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,030
Focus.
(chuckles)

313
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:57,965
What I don't get is
how this helps us

314
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,433
track down this thief;
why are we here?

315
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:01,869
Well, two reasons,
actually.

316
00:14:01,903 --> 00:14:04,005
Uh, boobs.

317
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:05,339
Why am I not surprised?

318
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:08,475
(chuckles) No, remember
that news report thingy?

319
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:11,045
Well, there was a picture
of our dead man

320
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:14,448
standing next to a very
distinctive décolletage.

321
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:17,218
You identified a
human by her boobs?

322
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,619
Not any boobs, Brother.

323
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:20,254
These ones are very special.

324
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,256
That mole, those curves,

325
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:26,260
they could only belong to
the one and only Misty Canyons.

326
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,362
And exactly how does this
help me find my necklace?

327
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:30,164
Well, if we want to
find Aiden's killer,

328
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:31,565
what better way
to get information

329
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:32,666
than from his lover?

330
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:34,135
Trust me,

331
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:35,669
a church confessional
has nothing

332
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,371
compared to pillow talk.

333
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:42,143
Oh, my gosh,
that's her, in the flesh.

334
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:43,377
That's Misty Canyons.

335
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,914
Oh, my gosh!
That's Penis Demilo.

336
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:48,149
Ha!

337
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:50,417
What is this, nirvana?

338
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:53,520
Do all porn stars
reside in L.A.?

339
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:54,655
Right, how do I look?

340
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:56,123
Oh, come on, Luci.

341
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:58,192
There must be hundreds
of porn stars in Hell.

342
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:01,295
Sadly, no, on account
of all the good work

343
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:03,297
they do here on Earth, I assume.

344
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,399
Right, maybe she'll
sign my chest,

345
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:07,634
or something else.
(chuckles)

346
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:11,438
Sorry, it's a closed set.

347
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:14,575
I'm here to talk to
Misty Canyons about pillow talk.

348
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:16,177
Why didn't you say so?

349
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:19,680
Ms. Canyons.

350
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:21,648
Hi.

351
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:23,284
Lucifer Morningstar.
(chuckles)

352
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:27,288
Can I just say that I am
a huge, huge fan of yours?

353
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,456
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much.

354
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,425
L.A. Whorey.
What a classic.

355
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,627
Aw. I really put my all
into that one.

356
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,596
Yes, you did, didn't you?
And it showed.

357
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:37,664
One might say that
you were born for it.

358
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:40,434
Oh. Well, my dream
is to sing,

359
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:43,404
but until then, porn pays
way better than waitressing.

360
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:44,238
Ah.

361
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:47,108
Plus, I kind of like it.

362
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:50,111
Goodness me,
your parents must be so proud.

363
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:51,212
I wish.

364
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:53,180
Well, they told me
to do what I love,

365
00:15:53,214 --> 00:15:55,616
and turns out I love sex.

366
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,151
Oh, so you're a rebel.

367
00:15:57,184 --> 00:15:58,219
(giggles)

368
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:00,021
I guess so.
(chuckles)

369
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:03,357
And if you really want to rebel,
move to L.A., right?

370
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,628
All I know is that I have
never been happier, freer.

371
00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:10,631
Uh, we're ready for
you on set, Misty.

372
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:11,298
Okay.

373
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:12,699
Well, if you ever
do decide

374
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,368
to do something worthy
of damnation,

375
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:16,137
I'd love to see you again.

376
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:21,108
AMENADIEL:
Where's the rest of it?

377
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:23,144
Ooh, I almost forgot.

378
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,516
("Pony" by Ginuwine playing)

379
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:37,491
* If you're horny,
let's do it... *

380
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:40,127
MISTY: You must be
the window washer.

381
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:41,262
Well, good thing,

382
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:43,630
because I was feeling dirty.

383
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:46,300
I am here to discuss
a lost necklace.

384
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,037
MISTY: So, you're
a window-washer

385
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:51,105
jeweler?

386
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:52,573
No.

387
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:55,209
Well, this took a turn,
didn't it?

388
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,578
Well, I haven't seen
your necklace.

389
00:16:57,611 --> 00:17:00,414
Was it made of pearls,
by chance?

390
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:03,317
It's actually a rod.

391
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,552
Unbreakable, very special.

392
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:09,323
Time to see the family jewels.

393
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:10,391
What? No, no, no!

394
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:12,759
Y-You're not gonna find
my necklace down there.

395
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:16,130
The man who killed
Aiden Scott has it.

396
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:18,132
What?

397
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,501
Aiden's dead?

398
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:24,171
Aiden was such a good guy.

399
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,273
He accepted everyone,
you know?

400
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:28,375
I can't think of anyone
who'd want to hurt him.

401
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:32,146
Even the people he fought
respected him.

402
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,749
He lost a lot.

403
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:36,683
But he never quit.

404
00:17:36,717 --> 00:17:38,719
Aiden actually thought
he could win the fight

405
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:42,256
he had coming up, though,
which is why he was so pissed

406
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:43,690
when someone asked him
to throw it.

407
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:46,760
Someone asked him to throw
that fight, but he refused?

408
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:49,630
For a ton of money, yeah.

409
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:52,266
But he didn't care,
he just wanted to win,

410
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:53,800
fair and square.

411
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,869
Whoever tried to bribe Aiden
to throw that fight

412
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:58,505
must have been pretty angry
when temptation didn't sway him.

413
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:01,175
Maybe the tempter killed
him in frustration,

414
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,709
and then took my necklace.

415
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:04,711
You have any idea
who approached him?

416
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:08,115
No. I mean, the fight was
supposed to be tomorrow

417
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:10,817
at Rico's in Hollywood.

418
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:12,586
Maybe someone there would know.

419
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:20,394
GIL: Everyone's real
torn up about Aiden.

420
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:22,263
We're like family here.

421
00:18:22,296 --> 00:18:24,665
So, uh, you were close
with him, too?

422
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:25,832
(chuckles)

423
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:29,203
He was a scrawny little thing
when I started training him.

424
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:32,206
But one dedicated
son of a "B."

425
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:34,141
Nothing could stop that guy.

426
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:37,144
Well, almost nothing.

427
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:39,413
Uh, do you know if Aiden ran
the same route every day?

428
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:40,647
I think so. Why?

429
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:43,584
Well, 'cause if somebody
wanted to kill him,

430
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:45,286
you know, they'd
know where he'd be.

431
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:48,555
I thought you cops were saying
this was just a random robbery.

432
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:52,326
Did you notice any unusual
behavior with Aiden lately?

433
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,195
Uh, arguments, grudges?

434
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:57,931
Well, actually, there was
one guy he butted heads with:

435
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:01,368
a promoter, Tio Sorrento.

436
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:03,337
Sketchy guy.
Never paid his fighters.

437
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,173
Tio and his tattooed buddy
got into it with Aiden

438
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:07,574
a couple weeks back.

439
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:09,443
But I didn't think
anything of it.

440
00:19:09,476 --> 00:19:12,213
You know where I can find him?

441
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:14,448
*

442
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:15,449
(bell dings)

443
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:17,618
(crowd cheering)

444
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,288
(women grunting)

445
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:24,425
I could get used
to this place.

446
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:40,374
So what's the plan?

447
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:41,975
*

448
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:44,745
Lucifer!

449
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:46,447
What's the plan?

450
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,748
I...

451
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,419
Plan is to get a drink.

452
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:54,521
Can't think
when I'm sober.

453
00:19:58,325 --> 00:19:59,326
Hello.

454
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,561
Apparently, they have, uh,

455
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:02,463
12 different types
of whiskey.

456
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:04,265
Yes, humans are funny

457
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:06,567
with their infinite capacity
for distractions.

458
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,802
LUCIFER:
It's not distraction, Brother.

459
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:09,936
It's choice.

460
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,972
LAPD! Freeze!

461
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,208
Excuse me.

462
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:18,279
If you're through
with your distraction,

463
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:20,281
I'd like to find
my necklace.

464
00:20:20,314 --> 00:20:22,983
Two fingers of your finest
Scotch, please, neat.

465
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:26,453
And, uh, who looks
after the fights?

466
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:28,889
Tio Sorrento. Everything
goes through him.

467
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,825
Thank you.

468
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:33,827
(crowd cheering)

469
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,799
Apparently,
you arranged the fight

470
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:40,567
that a recently deceased
Aiden Scott

471
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,469
was going to wage.

472
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:43,870
Let me guess.

473
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:45,972
Your fighter wants on the card
tomorrow night.

474
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:48,309
My fighter?
But...

475
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:51,712
Oh, yes. No, Amenadiel is
quite the warrior.

476
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:54,615
Undefeated in battle,
one of God's finest.

477
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,817
Actually, that's true.

478
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,586
How come I've never
seen you two before?

479
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,721
What's your name?

480
00:21:00,754 --> 00:21:02,456
Lucifer Morningstar.

481
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:04,725
Pleasure.
Where are you two from?

482
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:06,927
Down south.
Up north.

483
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:09,896
Sorry, I don't book strangers.

484
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,499
(chuckles)
I'm afraid I must insist.

485
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:19,740
(chuckles)

486
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:22,275
(crowd gasping)

487
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:25,879
You just knocked out
the former heavyweight champ

488
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:26,980
with one punch.

489
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:28,415
LUCIFER:
Like I said,

490
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:30,484
God's finest.

491
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,419
My man.

492
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:33,754
(laughs)

493
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:35,822
* We just want to have,
we just want to have *

494
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:38,992
* Yeah, we just
want to have fun. *

495
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:44,931
How does this plan help me
get my necklace back?

496
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:47,067
Well, our
killer/necklace thief

497
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,104
undoubtedly murdered Aiden Scott
for refusing to throw his fight.

498
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:53,006
So, in order
to flush out

499
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,876
our killer/necklace thief, we
need to get them to approach you

500
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:58,812
the same way that he or she
approached our dead fighter.

501
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:00,481
It's quite simple, really.

502
00:22:00,514 --> 00:22:02,549
Or stupid.
(sighs) Yes.

503
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,717
Well, the jewelry
recovery playbook's

504
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,851
a little thin here, Brother,

505
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:06,820
so unless you have
any better ideas...

506
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:09,556
Didn't think so.

507
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,891
But why do I need
to train, Luci?

508
00:22:10,924 --> 00:22:14,361
I am the Silver City's
greatest fighter.

509
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:15,862
Again, disputable.

510
00:22:15,896 --> 00:22:17,931
You raised
a few too many eyebrows

511
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:18,899
with your
one-punch knockout.

512
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:21,368
So no more displays
of celestial strength.

513
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:22,669
If we want to be approached,

514
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:25,038
then you need to learn
to fight like a human.

515
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,139
¿Comprende?

516
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,808
Okay.

517
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:28,609
Give us your worst.

518
00:22:28,642 --> 00:22:30,777
(sighs)

519
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,153
(sighs)

520
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:43,089
("You're the Best"
by Joe Esposito playing)

521
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:45,926
* Try to be best
'cause you're only a man *

522
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,994
* And a man's got
to learn to take it *

523
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:50,964
* Try to believe
though the going gets rough *

524
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:52,599
* That you got to hang tough
to make it... *

525
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:53,767
Go!

526
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,868
* You're the best around

527
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:56,102
(imitates clucking)

00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:58,472
* Nothing's gonna
ever keep you down... *

529
00:22:58,505 --> 00:23:00,040
LUCIFER:
Uh, uh-uh! No.

530
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:01,742
No cheating.

531
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:03,009
* Nothing's gonna
ever keep you down *

532
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:04,478
* You're the best...

533
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:05,412
Eh.

534
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:10,851
* Nothing's gonna
ever keep you down *

535
00:23:10,884 --> 00:23:13,019
* Down...

536
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:15,021
(straining)

537
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:18,992
Very good.

538
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:23,163
Finally.

539
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,165
Lovely. Yes. Yes.

540
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:26,433
Yes.

541
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,434
There we go.

542
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:32,473
(Lucifer laughs)

543
00:23:32,506 --> 00:23:34,007
Oh, Brother.

544
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,443
Your fighter
looks good.

545
00:23:36,477 --> 00:23:37,911
Well, I certainly hope so,

546
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:40,581
'cause I'm ready
to make some cash.

547
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:43,049
Which is all
I really care about.

548
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,586
Cold hard cash.

549
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:48,054
Win or lose?

550
00:23:48,088 --> 00:23:50,824
Whatever it takes.

551
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:54,461
So he'd take a fall?

552
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,964
For the right price.

553
00:23:57,998 --> 00:24:01,468
Rumor has it that Aiden Scott
was offered a hell of a deal,

554
00:24:01,502 --> 00:24:03,804
so we want the same.

555
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:06,206
Well, that someone is me.

556
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,108
Lovely.

557
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:18,552
CHLOE:
Dan.

558
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:19,820
Hey, what's up?

559
00:24:19,853 --> 00:24:21,822
Hey.
Who's that?

560
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:23,957
One of Tio Sorrento's thugs.

561
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,159
The, uh, fight promoter
you were telling me about.

562
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:28,729
Yeah. Who was seen
arguing with Aiden Scott

563
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:30,096
just before he was killed.

564
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,165
Tats here has
multiple warrants out,

565
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:34,067
and after a little squeeze,
I found out

566
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,102
that Tio fixes fights
for the Sarkisians.

567
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:37,938
As in the Sarkisian
crime family?

568
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:39,973
Yeah, so what if Tio tried
to fix Aiden's fight,

569
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:41,842
and he refused,
and he killed him for it?

570
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,778
Well, I'd say that's
a pretty interesting theory.

571
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:46,246
I sense there's an "and" coming.

572
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,948
And I'd like to talk
to Tio's lawyer,

573
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:50,517
see if I can maneuver a deal.
Not a good idea.

574
00:24:50,551 --> 00:24:53,654
Why?
'Cause you don't have any
actual proof yet, Chloe.

575
00:24:53,687 --> 00:24:54,655
All right? If
you're wrong,

576
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:56,089
you get nothing
and Tio knows we're onto him.

577
00:24:56,122 --> 00:24:58,725
Dan, I'm right. I can feel it.

578
00:24:58,759 --> 00:24:59,893
Chloe, we'll
look into Tio.

579
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:02,128
But right now, you
got to be patient.

580
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:11,772
(chuckles softly)

581
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:14,575
(door closes)

582
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:15,609
Oh.

583
00:25:15,642 --> 00:25:16,710
(clears throat)

584
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:18,545
So, uh...

585
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:19,479
has he got your necklace?

586
00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:21,247
He claims to not know
it's whereabouts.

587
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:24,084
(school bell rings over TV,
TV clicks off)

588
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:26,887
I suppose it's time
to torture him.

589
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:30,023
So, you're up.
(scoffs)

590
00:25:30,056 --> 00:25:32,092
Look, just because
I am the King of Hell

591
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,595
doesn't mean I actually
do the torturing.

592
00:25:34,628 --> 00:25:35,996
I'm more of
a delegator.

593
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:38,999
But I assumed this
was going to happen,

594
00:25:39,032 --> 00:25:41,702
so I popped back down
while you were in there

595
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:44,605
and brought
up the best.

596
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:45,806
You remember Mazikeen.

597
00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:05,956
Hello, human.

598
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:07,658
(grunts)

599
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,026
Where am I?

600
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,227
Who are you?

601
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,963
I'm a demon.

602
00:26:12,996 --> 00:26:14,965
And I've risen from
the bowels of Hell

603
00:26:14,998 --> 00:26:17,034
to torture you.
I already told
that other guy

604
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:19,603
I don't know nothing
about Aiden Scott.

605
00:26:19,637 --> 00:26:21,872
(laughs)

606
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,645
That "other guy" wouldn't
know a flanged mace

607
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:29,680
from this...

608
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,015
...stabbing object.

609
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:38,722
I'm here for the truth.

610
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:40,323
You don't have to do this.

611
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:41,692
No.

612
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,627
I get to do this.

613
00:26:43,661 --> 00:26:44,895
(grunts)

614
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:46,363
Asphyxiation?
(shouts)

615
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,365
Electrocution?

616
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,400
There are so many ways

617
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,670
I could hurt you.

618
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:55,238
I just can't decide.

619
00:26:57,975 --> 00:26:59,943
Wow.

620
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:01,044
I'm on fire,

621
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,913
aren't you?

622
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:04,381
No.

623
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,150
I thought Hell was hot.

624
00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:09,687
(exhales, growls)

625
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,890
Well, that human
didn't kill anybody.

626
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:16,426
(Tio crying in distance)

627
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:19,429
And he doesn't know where your
stupid necklace is, either.

628
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:21,799
Also a bit of a crier, it seems.

629
00:27:21,832 --> 00:27:23,300
I hope you didn't
go too hard, Maze.

630
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,968
He's not in Hell yet.

631
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:26,169
Oh, no.

632
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:28,305
Those are tears of joy.

633
00:27:28,338 --> 00:27:30,207
Oh, so he's a masochist.

634
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,908
(chuckles)

635
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,309
They can be
quite tricky.

636
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:33,310
What did you use

637
00:27:33,343 --> 00:27:34,311
to inflict the pain?

638
00:27:34,344 --> 00:27:36,046
Nothing.
Hmm?

639
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,750
In Hell, I have to use their own
guilt against them as torture.

640
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,218
The method is
chosen for them,

641
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,452
but here, Lucifer...

642
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:43,887
(stammers)

643
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:45,322
...infinite possibilities.

644
00:27:45,355 --> 00:27:46,924
I got so excited,

645
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,726
I just had sex with him.

646
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:49,659
(groans)

647
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:51,428
(laughs):
And then he wouldn't shut up.

648
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,864
(laughs)
Enough.

649
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:58,201
That man tried to bribe me into
throwing a fight, all right?

650
00:27:58,235 --> 00:28:00,437
Now, he practically admitted
doing the same with Aiden Scott,

651
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,939
so he must be lying to you.

652
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,975
Nobody lies to me.

653
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:06,476
The human said
he wanted to fix

654
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:10,080
the dead one's fight,
but someone beat him to it.

655
00:28:10,113 --> 00:28:13,083
Said someone placed
a huge anonymous bet.

656
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:14,885
Half a million dollars
on Aiden Scott losing.

657
00:28:14,918 --> 00:28:15,986
AMENADIEL:
Whoever placed that bet

658
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:18,822
probably killed Aiden Scott
and stole my necklace.

659
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:21,391
Tio doesn't know
who that is, either.

660
00:28:21,424 --> 00:28:24,762
Said they only communicated
anonymously...

661
00:28:24,795 --> 00:28:26,830
...through burner phones
and dead drops.

662
00:28:26,864 --> 00:28:29,466
So Tio has no idea
who this man is,

663
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,869
and no way of finding out.

664
00:28:31,902 --> 00:28:34,738
Which basically means
your so-called torture

665
00:28:34,772 --> 00:28:35,873
has been useless.

666
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:41,511
You want to go, bird boy?

667
00:28:41,544 --> 00:28:43,213
Ooh, now this is
getting interesting.

668
00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:45,082
Luci, we still need
to find this thief.

669
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:46,016
(sighs)

670
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:48,351
And you're not gonna...

671
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:50,120
Very well.

672
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:53,023
Whoever stole your necklace
tried to gamble on a sure thing.

673
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:57,861
So, maybe we could persuade
our thief to gamble on another.

674
00:28:57,895 --> 00:28:59,529
So if we convince
this killer thief

675
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:01,164
to bet on my fight instead,

676
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,166
and I take the fall
I promise to take,

677
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,435
then we wait wherever the money
is supposed to be dropped off,

678
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:06,837
and then we see who shows up.

679
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,338
You are cleverer than you look.

680
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:12,175
Maze, do you think you can
persuade Tio to arrange that?

681
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:16,213
Where should I begin?

682
00:29:19,082 --> 00:29:21,985
Excuse me-- oh, no, no.
I'm good. Charlotte Richards.

683
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:23,987
Hi. I'm here regarding
your client Tio Sorrento.

684
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:25,488
ETIENNE: I'm sorry,
Ms. Richards, she just...

685
00:29:25,522 --> 00:29:27,290
Oh, it's fine, Etienne.

686
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:29,960
I always have time
for law enforcement.

687
00:29:29,993 --> 00:29:33,063
You are law
enforcement, yes?

688
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:35,065
Yes, I, um...
I'm Officer Decker,

689
00:29:35,098 --> 00:29:37,067
and I'm here to help Tio.

690
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,870
And what makes you think
that I need your help

691
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,439
representing my client? Hmm?

692
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:45,943
Uh, well, because we know he
works for the Sarkisian family.

693
00:29:45,976 --> 00:29:47,845
Mm-hmm.
And he's also implicated

694
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:49,880
in the murder
of Aiden Scott.

695
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,082
So if he agrees
to speak with us,

696
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:53,817
we'll go easier on him.

697
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:56,386
Have you ever heard of
something called "leverage,"

698
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,454
Officer Decker?

699
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:01,524
If not, let me help you.

700
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:04,094
It's like pressure or influence,

701
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:07,397
and it's something
that you currently can't apply,

702
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,599
because none of what you
said actually resembles

703
00:30:09,632 --> 00:30:11,368
proof of a crime.

704
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:12,502
Why do you say that?

705
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:15,438
Because when you're out there
writing traffic tickets,

706
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:18,976
I'm representing families
like the Lings and the Sokolovs.

707
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:20,143
Actual killers.

708
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:23,546
Alleged, anyway.

709
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,851
So it's going to take
a lot more than spunk--

710
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:32,489
especially rookie spunk--
and a prayer to intimidate me.

711
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,961
You represent
the Sokolov family?

712
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:39,930
And you also represent

713
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,531
Tio and the Sarkisians.

714
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:43,934
So, I-I thought
the Sarkisians

715
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,268
and the Sokolovs were at war

716
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,637
over their bookmaking
operations.

717
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,372
I wonder how they'd feel
if they knew

718
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:52,475
that their lawyer
was double-dipping.

719
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:55,145
(chuckles): You know,
I'm-I'm new at this, so...

720
00:30:55,178 --> 00:30:58,015
I don't know what the term is
for what you're doing,

721
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,918
but I think
it's called "leverage."

722
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:07,057
Please have a seat, Officer.

723
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,392
Aw, thank you.

724
00:31:15,432 --> 00:31:18,035
I didn't expect you
to be so happy

725
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:19,970
to lose your first
fight ever, Brother.

726
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,071
And to a human, no less.

727
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:23,373
Nice try, Luci, but we both
know this doesn't count.

728
00:31:23,406 --> 00:31:25,308
Ah.
Not to mention the fact

729
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,310
that no mere mortal could
ever stand a chance

730
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,946
against the full power
of my God-given...

731
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:29,913
Forget it.
I regret mentioning it.

732
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:33,483
(music thumping, crowd cheering
in distance)

733
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,285
(bell dings)

734
00:31:35,318 --> 00:31:36,954
Looks like you might be
up soon, Brother.

735
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:38,956
Luci, thanks.

736
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:41,491
What?
Thanks for your help.

737
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,427
I mean, I... will admit
that I was a bit skeptical

738
00:31:44,461 --> 00:31:47,330
of your plan, but this
might actually work.

739
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,698
Yes, of course
it'll work, Brother.

740
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:50,067
That's why you asked me,
remember?

741
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,002
Someone crafty, smart...

742
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,004
And evil. (laughs)

743
00:31:55,672 --> 00:31:56,706
Evil?

744
00:31:56,739 --> 00:31:58,942
Well, if you want to find
a deplorable criminal,

745
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,511
you just ask a-- well,
you know what I mean, Luci.

746
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,645
Come on.

747
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:04,714
You are the Devil, after all.

748
00:32:04,747 --> 00:32:07,050
*

749
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:24,634
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen,

750
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,636
we have a scratch on the card.

751
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:32,976
Please welcome
a new fighter to the cage:

752
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,412
Lucifer...

753
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:38,115
Morningstar!

754
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:40,183
(crowd cheering)

755
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:42,285
You wanted the Devil.

756
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,222
Well, you got him.

757
00:32:49,725 --> 00:32:50,993
(bell dings)
Where's the human fighter?

758
00:32:51,027 --> 00:32:53,129
Off to join
the Renaissance fair,

759
00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:54,730
whatever that is.

760
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:56,432
Apparently, he
loves the mandolin.

761
00:32:56,465 --> 00:32:58,134
So that leaves you

762
00:32:58,167 --> 00:32:59,301
with big bad me.

763
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:00,769
Why are you doing this, Lucifer?

764
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:03,072
(chuckles):
Well, who better than the Devil

765
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:06,242
to help you do something
so wickedly dishonest

766
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,277
as to throw a fight?

767
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,311
(both grunt)

768
00:33:09,345 --> 00:33:11,547
You're welcome, by the way.
This is pointless!

769
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,749
Well, we're finally answering
the age-old question:

770
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:16,052
"Who'd win in a fight,
you or me?"

771
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:18,387
This doesn't count!

772
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,456
So be it, Brother.

773
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:22,458
So be it.

774
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:24,160
*

775
00:33:24,193 --> 00:33:25,561
(both grunting)

776
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:34,603
I'll make sure I tell
everyone in Heaven and Hell

777
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:37,373
how the undefeated
warrior lost

778
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:40,142
to his loser, evil,
little brother. (chuckles)

779
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:43,412
Oh, I guess you're not so tough
after all, are you, eh?

780
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:45,647
Daddy's boy.

781
00:33:49,685 --> 00:33:51,420
(yells)

782
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:01,697
(crowd cheers)

783
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,332
See?

784
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:05,134
You're just as bad
as me, Brother.

785
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:08,537
Pride is your sin, too.

786
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,373
(Lucifer yells)

787
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:13,775
*

788
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:33,195
(grunts)

789
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:34,530
Get up.

790
00:34:36,598 --> 00:34:38,567
(crowd groans)

791
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,405
What am I doing?

792
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:45,141
Fight me.

793
00:34:45,174 --> 00:34:46,542
No.

794
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:49,845
You see, I won't
stoop down to your level.

795
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:54,250
Because I am
better than you are.

796
00:34:54,283 --> 00:34:57,486
(crowd jeering)

797
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:01,590
(Lucifer grunts)

798
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:03,625
Fight me!

799
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,266
(stammers)

800
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,735
Winner by submission!

801
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:16,104
(crowd cheering and jeering)

802
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:23,878
It's been, like,
two hours, Chloe.

803
00:35:23,911 --> 00:35:26,181
I seriously doubt
Tio Sorrento's gonna show up.

804
00:35:26,214 --> 00:35:27,615
Especially now that
he knows he's a suspect

805
00:35:27,648 --> 00:35:28,616
in Aiden Scott's murder.

806
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:29,784
He swore to Charlotte Richards

807
00:35:29,817 --> 00:35:31,619
that he had nothing to do
with the murder

808
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:32,820
and that he'd help us
find the killer.

809
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:35,756
So he's just gonna drop a bunch
of cash off into a locker?

810
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,525
Yeah, if that's what's gonna
clear his name.

811
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:38,759
And whoever picks it up

812
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:40,628
either killed Aiden Scott
or knows who did.

813
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:42,663
And if you're wrong?

814
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:43,898
Tio doesn't show up,

815
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:45,866
he alerts his bosses
about our investigation.

816
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,636
Our entire case against
them is destroyed.

817
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:50,771
You know, going to see
Charlotte Richards,

818
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:52,440
that was a big gamble.

819
00:35:52,473 --> 00:35:53,541
And I want you
to make detective,

820
00:35:53,574 --> 00:35:55,276
more than anyone,

821
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,845
but I'm worried that this
is gonna set you back.

822
00:35:57,878 --> 00:35:59,514
I know.

823
00:35:59,547 --> 00:36:00,581
I know you are.

824
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:03,318
But sometimes this job
is about taking risks, right?

825
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:08,223
Besides, you know,
my gut tells me I'm right.

826
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:23,238
Most impressive, Brother,
swallowing your pride like that.

827
00:36:23,271 --> 00:36:24,805
Hope you haven't spent
too long on Earth.

828
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:25,740
It seems to have softened you.

829
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:28,343
Luci, I just hope
whoever stole my necklace

830
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:31,612
won't take too long
to pick up their winnings.

831
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:33,381
The sooner I can grab him
and retrieve it,

832
00:36:33,414 --> 00:36:34,482
the sooner I can leave.

833
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:36,551
I think we both

834
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:37,952
stayed here for far too long.

835
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,426
Killer/necklace
thief alert.

836
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,827
Is that Gil,

837
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:48,529
the owner of the gym?

838
00:36:48,563 --> 00:36:49,497
Yeah.
Ugh.

839
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,598
All right, I'll arrest him.

840
00:36:50,631 --> 00:36:51,866
You grab Tio.

841
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:55,336
CHLOE:
Gil. Drop the bag.

842
00:36:57,572 --> 00:36:58,739
(Gil screams)

843
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:07,315
Where's my necklace?

844
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:08,449
Where am I?

845
00:37:08,483 --> 00:37:10,518
Who are you? What necklace?

846
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:12,019
The one you stole from me.

847
00:37:12,052 --> 00:37:13,421
Wait.

848
00:37:13,454 --> 00:37:14,755
That was you in the street?

849
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:16,324
H-How'd we get here?

850
00:37:16,357 --> 00:37:17,191
We flew.

851
00:37:17,224 --> 00:37:18,759
Thought we needed
a bit of privacy.

852
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:20,695
Who are you?

853
00:37:20,728 --> 00:37:22,363
And you, I-I-I shot you.

854
00:37:23,298 --> 00:37:24,432
And yet
he's standing here alive.

855
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:26,267
It's shocking, isn't it?

856
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:28,803
Look, I-I don't want
any trouble.

857
00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:30,671
I'll get you a new necklace.

858
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:31,806
No, see, I want mine.

859
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,874
It's just a necklace.
What's the big deal about it?

860
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:36,477
Because my father gave it to me!

861
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:37,678
GIL (stammers):
Look.

862
00:37:37,712 --> 00:37:40,047
Taking the necklace
wasn't part of my plan.

863
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,950
So you planned to
kill the other human?

864
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:45,453
No, that was a mistake, too.

865
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:46,754
Aiden was like a son to me.

866
00:37:46,787 --> 00:37:49,557
I got into some money trouble.
I thought of a fix.

867
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,691
Aiden throws his fight.

868
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:54,462
We bet on it,
take home a huge payday.

869
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:55,630
Both of us.

870
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:58,399
But the fighter didn't want
to play his part, did he?

871
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,901
He said he'd rather walk away
from it than throw it.

872
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:02,570
I went to try to scare him,

873
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:03,704
but Aiden fought back.

874
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:07,041
I panicked, I shot him.

875
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:09,544
Tried to make it look
like a robbery.

876
00:38:09,577 --> 00:38:10,945
That's when I saw you.

877
00:38:10,978 --> 00:38:12,947
I-I didn't know
what you'd seen, I'm sorry.

878
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,616
I'm gonna ask you
for the last time.

879
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,552
Where...

880
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:19,086
is my necklace?

881
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,356
It's in the gym.

882
00:38:21,389 --> 00:38:22,457
It's in my safe.

883
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,092
Let's go drop him
back at the beach.

884
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,728
Just a moment.

885
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:30,665
So you killed
your so-called "son"

886
00:38:30,698 --> 00:38:32,533
for refusing
to play a part

887
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,034
in your plan.

888
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:36,771
Now, that is just pure evil.

889
00:38:36,804 --> 00:38:39,840
And I should know.

890
00:38:39,874 --> 00:38:43,378
Because I am the King of Evil.

891
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,647
No! No!

892
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:47,748
(air whooshes)

893
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:49,550
GIL:
(screams) I did it!

894
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:50,651
(crying):
I...

895
00:38:50,685 --> 00:38:52,052
(groans)

896
00:38:52,086 --> 00:38:53,821
DAN: Where the hell
did he come from?

897
00:38:53,854 --> 00:38:56,624
I did it.
I-I killed Aiden Scott.

898
00:38:56,657 --> 00:38:57,858
I'm sorry,
it's-it's all my fault.

899
00:38:57,892 --> 00:38:59,794
I... I killed him.

900
00:38:59,827 --> 00:39:02,897
Sounds like
a confession to me.

901
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,468
Looks like your gamble paid off.

902
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:09,069
(handcuffs clicking)

903
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:19,013
AMENADIEL:
Luci, why are we back here?

904
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:21,382
It's time for
us to leave.

905
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:23,984
We've been here on
Earth long enough.

906
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:28,022
Yes, you see, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

907
00:39:28,055 --> 00:39:29,624
(sighs)

908
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:30,758
I'm not leaving.

909
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,627
(chuckles softly)

910
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,994
What?

911
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:36,597
I'm saying that I've realized
something here

912
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:38,899
in this City of Angels.

913
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:42,437
That I really am
no longer one anymore.

914
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,772
(laughs)

915
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:48,008
And if that's true,

916
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:51,879
then why am I still
trying to please Father?

917
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:56,451
Eons-- eons-- spent condemned
to my fate in Hell,

918
00:39:56,484 --> 00:39:59,620
and yet I'm still trying
to seek His approval.

919
00:39:59,654 --> 00:40:02,022
Still playing a part
in His play.

920
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:05,926
Well, no more, Brother.

921
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,565
He abandoned me,
so why shouldn't I abandon Him?

922
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:14,735
It's time I fully accept
how everyone else sees me:

923
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:16,837
the rebel.

924
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:20,074
As a wise woman
once said to me,

925
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:22,777
"If you really want
to rebel, move to L.A."

926
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,844
Stop.

927
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:27,648
Lucifer, as much as I am moved
by your sentiment,

928
00:40:27,682 --> 00:40:28,949
unfortunately, that's a no.

929
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:30,651
You are coming back
to Hell with me.

930
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:32,219
There's no discussion.

931
00:40:32,252 --> 00:40:34,589
(sighs)

932
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:37,492
Yes, you see...

933
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:39,494
this is where
it gets interesting.

934
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:41,762
We made a deal,
didn't we,

935
00:40:41,796 --> 00:40:44,098
for a favor to be named later.

936
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:46,867
Later is now.

937
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:48,836
And my ask, it's quite simple.

938
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:50,204
Leave me be.

939
00:40:50,237 --> 00:40:51,205
You know I can't do that.

940
00:40:51,238 --> 00:40:53,808
Well, isn't it a sin for
an angel to break a vow?

941
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:55,610
(sighs):
Oh, Luci.

942
00:40:57,812 --> 00:41:01,115
Father will be furious.

943
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:03,518
And you will suffer His wrath.

944
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:04,985
Well...

945
00:41:07,187 --> 00:41:09,690
...then He knows
where to find me.

946
00:41:16,196 --> 00:41:19,634
("American Funeral" by Alex
da Kid and Joseph Angel playing)

947
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,602
(sighs)

948
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:26,173
This place could use a piano.

949
00:41:26,206 --> 00:41:30,044
* I just put my hand up

950
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:34,682
* Then they put me
in handcuffs *

951
00:41:34,715 --> 00:41:39,554
* They just scared 'cause
they don't understand us *

952
00:41:39,587 --> 00:41:43,858
* Try to beat us down
when we try to stand up *

953
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:46,627
* I didn't even do nothin'

954
00:41:46,661 --> 00:41:48,663
* America

955
00:41:48,696 --> 00:41:50,665
* The beautiful

956
00:41:50,698 --> 00:41:52,767
* Oh, America

957
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,302
* God bless America

958
00:41:55,335 --> 00:42:00,007
* Give me my freedom, yeah

959
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,810
* Oh, baby

960
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:04,311
* Yeah

961
00:42:04,344 --> 00:42:07,882
* Give me my freedom

962
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:11,786
* No, oh

963
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:13,087
* Uh

964
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,222
(blade slicing)

965
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:17,024
* America

966
00:42:17,057 --> 00:42:19,827
* The beautiful

967
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,829
* America

968
00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:22,830
* Oh...

969
00:42:22,863 --> 00:42:24,198
* The murderer

970
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:27,167
* Here in America

971
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:29,003
* The beautiful

972
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:31,105
* Oh, America

973
00:42:31,138 --> 00:42:34,775
* God bless America.
