1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:02,628
- Previously on Lucifer...
- God cursed Cain

2
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:03,946
because he killed his own brother.

3
00:00:03,948 --> 00:00:05,173
She's the key to finally getting

4
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:06,675
- what I've always wanted.
- Just wish I knew that

5
00:00:06,677 --> 00:00:08,164
Pierce's intentions were pure.

6
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,718
If you want to take
it slow, that's okay,

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,136
but from where I stand, I'm all in.

8
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,382
I told you not to talk to Charlotte.

9
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:14,546
She's a human woman

10
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,263
who isn't ready to hear
what you have to say.

11
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:18,192
I was in Hell. And that's insane.

12
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,543
Charlotte, do you have a minute?

13
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:22,029
At this point, things
can't get any crazier.

14
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:23,465
I am done with Earth

15
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:25,309
in general. I want to go home.

16
00:00:25,312 --> 00:00:28,064
Last time I took someone
on a celestial Uber ride,

17
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,332
the detective almost died.

18
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:31,101
You're afraid of your daddy?

19
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:33,176
You are gonna regret this.

20
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:35,007
I can help us both get what we want.

21
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:49,157
Where's my money?

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,871
I just don't have it. I lost it.

23
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,777
What do you mean you
lost it? Where is it?

24
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,421
What do you want me to say?

25
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,926
9-1-1. What is your emergency?

26
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,786
- Hello? People are fighting in my house.
- Come on, Kevin.

27
00:01:00,788 --> 00:01:02,320
Kevin, stop.

28
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,767
Oh...

29
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:23,008
Good morning, Detective Decker.

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,747
- Good morning, Lieutenant Pierce.
- Hey.

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,045
Have you seen the evidence closet?

32
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:28,948
Uh... no.

33
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:35,854
Wow.

34
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:38,492
This is a great closet.

35
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:39,758
And, um...

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,700
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:51,132
Get some, Decker.

38
00:01:54,508 --> 00:01:56,041
Look at that.

39
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,796
It's always nice to start the day

40
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,111
nose to nose, isn't it?

41
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:00,645
Speaking of, you'll never guess

42
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:02,114
what happened to me
last night, Detective.

43
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:04,335
What's that?

44
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:05,537
I woke up alone.

45
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,573
- And?
- It's funny because

46
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:09,020
I usually don't, because I usually

47
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:11,817
have women over, or
men, or both for sex.

48
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,391
Okay.

49
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:14,960
Will he be

50
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,194
coming with you from now on?

51
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:17,734
Because he is killing our banter.

52
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:18,830
Absolutely not, no.

53
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:21,233
Pierce and I only came...

54
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:23,707
Drove together just this one time.

55
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,911
One time.

56
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,571
- Right.
- Apparently...

57
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:28,240
the victim's from a
well-connected family.

58
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:30,609
The suits downtown want me
to keep them in the loop.

59
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:31,943
Don't worry, I won't interfere

60
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,207
with the investigation,

61
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,881
- or the, uh, dream team.
- Uh-uh.

62
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:38,617
Now, if you'll excuse me.

63
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:41,289
Okay. Shall we?

64
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:44,356
Uh... you have DNA on your shirt.

65
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:45,892
What?

66
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:50,263
Oh... um...

67
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,801
Oh, weird.

68
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:03,074
Hey, Ella, what's up?

69
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:06,044
You tell me what's up, player.

70
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:08,847
So, dead guy?

71
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,448
There must be an I.D.

72
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,850
Right.

73
00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:14,319
Here lies Kevin Winstead

74
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,588
of the Winsteads.

75
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,190
34 years old.

76
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:19,591
The Winsteads?

77
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:21,693
The wealthy real estate
family from New York.

78
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:23,628
Oh. So, what's he doing getting killed

79
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,364
in such a crappy neighborhood?

80
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:26,998
Apparently, he rented a room here.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,161
Not sure why he would, but Kevin

82
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:33,205
was notoriously the black
sheep of the Winstead clan.

83
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,140
Heroin addiction.

84
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:37,108
Although...

85
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,254
from the looks of these
healed track marks,

86
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:41,713
it appears that Kevin might
have gone clean recently.

87
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:43,023
Not an easy thing to do.

88
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:44,983
And, apparently, a waste of his time.

89
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,231
What was the cause of death?

90
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:47,703
Gunshot wound to the chest.

91
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:50,106
- Shot during a home invasion robbery?
- Maybe.

92
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,262
But the killer never got
around to taking anything.

93
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,481
Got interrupted by the house's owner.

94
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,661
Oh, that poor boy.

95
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:58,196
He seemed nice.

96
00:03:58,198 --> 00:04:00,398
- Why don't you tell me what happened.
- I was sleeping,

97
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,575
and I heard glass breaking,

98
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:04,742
so I went down to check it out.

99
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,226
And then I heard arguing.

100
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,329
Uh, what were they arguing about?

101
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,489
The voices were muffled,
but I did hear someone say,

102
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:12,844
"Kevin, stop."

103
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:14,995
So, the intruder knew the victim.

104
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:17,465
The former heroin addict
had nefarious friends.

105
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,284
- Shocking.
- Did you get

106
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:21,119
a good look at the guy?

107
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:22,420
He was wearing a mask.

108
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:24,520
I would be dead for sure

109
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:27,090
if God hadn't sent that
angel to protect me.

110
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,148
So, there was someone else in the house.

111
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,187
Not another person.

112
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,395
An angel, who saved me.

113
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,797
It-it flew in here,

114
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,817
and it just chased the evil man away.

115
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,837
I'm sorry, sorry, it's
just the only thing

116
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,473
my siblings would chase
away are a good time.

117
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:43,341
I have proof.

118
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:45,977
The angel...

119
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,213
he took one of my figurines.

120
00:04:48,215 --> 00:04:50,615
Hmm? Gabriel.

121
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:52,784
Right.

122
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:54,019
Try lending him some money.

123
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:55,554
Your tune changes rather quickly.

124
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:56,988
Mrs. Hernandez, why don't we get you

125
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,257
checked out at the hospital?

126
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:01,328
- Thank you.
- Yes.

127
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,361
All right, let's do a
background check on Kevin.

128
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:05,063
Let's see if he had issues with anybody.

129
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:06,989
Keep an eye out for
this angelic witness.

130
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:08,833
Hey, maybe it was one of your brothers.

131
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:14,406
Seriously, is it one of your brothers?

132
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:15,807
Preposterous.

133
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:17,664
My Father doesn't send my siblings down

134
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:20,254
to intervene in petty
robberies in Pacoima.

135
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,731
He only sends them to harass me.

136
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:25,859
Oh, and speaking of...

137
00:05:25,862 --> 00:05:27,096
Hello?

138
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,296
Right, I'm here.

139
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,731
What's so dastardly important?

140
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,497
Okay, Luci, I think we made a mistake

141
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,097
revealing divinity
to Charlotte Richards.

142
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,801
We? It was your idea.

143
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:43,270
But now I'm having second thoughts.

144
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:44,903
What if she tells someone?

145
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:46,890
Oh, no, you're right.

146
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,006
'Cause then that person
might tell someone else,

147
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:51,379
who then might tell someone
else, which could lead to

148
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:53,945
absolutely nothing happening
'cause no one will believe her.

149
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:56,161
Okay, look, you might not care, Luci,

150
00:05:56,164 --> 00:05:58,463
but the concept of divinity is too big

151
00:05:58,466 --> 00:05:59,965
for humans to handle.

152
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:02,106
We don't know what she's
gonna do now that she knows.

153
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:03,437
And I don't care.

154
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,722
You're right.

155
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:06,357
Oh, question, brother.

156
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:08,900
You don't happen to know
if any of our siblings

157
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,036
might be in town?

158
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,529
Not that I'm aware of.

159
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:12,664
Ah.

160
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,742
Why?

161
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:15,300
Oh, it's probably nothing.

162
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:16,668
Just an old woman

163
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,346
in some unremarkable home said an angel

164
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:20,715
broke into her house.

165
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:21,940
Saved her life.

166
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:24,015
Stole one of her hideous figurines.

167
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:26,376
All that trouble for one ordinary human?

168
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,421
Yeah.

169
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:29,840
I mean, it would have
to be one very bored

170
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,749
or deeply confused angel.

171
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,921
Yea...

172
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:47,414
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

173
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:51,712
I mean, there must be some
sort of reasonable explanation.

174
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:53,497
And you don't remember how the figurine

175
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,806
- got into your bedroom?
- No.

176
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:56,931
I mean, maybe it's a
housewarming gift or...

177
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,892
or a sex toy.

178
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:00,493
Or a housewarming gift sex toy.

179
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:01,689
I just...

180
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,179
And it's identical to the one missing

181
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:04,709
- from that woman's house?
- Yes.

182
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:07,879
But it's coincidence, surely.

183
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:11,383
You've been complaining about
having weird dreams lately.

184
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:14,219
Including one where you
couldn't control your wings.

185
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:16,822
I've also dreamt I was
king of the centaur people.

186
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:18,728
Doesn't mean I'm gonna
start wearing horseshoes.

187
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,267
There have been instances
where people sleepwalk

188
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,240
when they're having difficulty
dealing with painful situations.

189
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,965
Or, inversely, not dealing with them.

190
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,401
Is it possible you're not
dealing with something,

191
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:31,774
and, thus, sleepflying?

192
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:33,510
That's absurd. I mean, what in the world

193
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,923
- could I not be dealing with?
- I don't know.

194
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:39,114
Chloe and Pierce, maybe?
Perhaps you're not as

195
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:41,579
okay with that
relationship as you think.

196
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:43,682
Look, I am not an idiot, Doctor.

197
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:46,673
Clearly, I don't love them together,

198
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,743
But I'm also not a 16-year-old

199
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:51,022
crying in my bedroom
with Adele on repeat.

200
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:54,458
And I'm definitely not this angel.

201
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:58,017
And, I know just how to prove it.

202
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,279
This was nice.

203
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,439
This was...

204
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,048
Crap.

205
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,963
Wow, not even remotely close

206
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,375
to what I thought you were gonna say.

207
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:12,603
No, no, the time. We got to go.

208
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:13,649
What? Why?

209
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:15,212
Trixie's gonna be home any minute.

210
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:17,110
And you don't want her to see me here.

211
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:19,050
Look, you're pretty
much the first person

212
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:20,352
that I've dated since Dan.

213
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:23,088
I haven't introduced Trixie to anybody.

214
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,056
And I just don't want to
do that until I'm sure.

215
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:28,358
And it's not that I'm not sure.

216
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:30,227
I just, I-I want to be ready,

217
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,696
and I want to know. You know?

218
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:32,964
Maybe I shouldn't have said all that.

219
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,767
- Anyhow...
- What's the prob...

220
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:40,454
Listen, fast or slow,
whatever the speed,

221
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:41,740
I'm into this.

222
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:43,451
If you haven't figured it out, Chloe,

223
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:44,985
I'm in...

224
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:46,860
I like you.

225
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,610
Sorry.

226
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:55,629
Oh, it's Lucifer.

227
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:58,467
- Of course it is.
- Got to go.

228
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:03,026
Ah!

229
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:04,084
Good, you're here.

230
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:05,556
We need to find the killer.

231
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,465
Is this that super important thing

232
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:09,367
you said you needed to talk to me about?

233
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:12,304
Yes, because this case is of
the utmost importance to me now.

234
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:14,940
- Really? Why?
- Because if,

235
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:16,641
in the miniscule realm of possibility,

236
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:19,077
that crazy old lady did,
in fact, see an angel,

237
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:21,196
I need to prove that
the angel wasn't me.

238
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,514
I think I can help with
that. It wasn't you.

239
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:24,983
Well, I'm sure you're probably right.

240
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:26,284
And when the killer confirms as such,

241
00:09:26,286 --> 00:09:27,368
I'll be one happy Devil.

242
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:28,771
So, come on, chop-chop. What do we got?

243
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:32,556
Okay, two days ago, Kevin checked out

244
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,024
of a high-end rehab
facility... Sunrise Sands.

245
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:36,761
And according to this incident report,

246
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:39,170
he got into a pretty nasty
fight with a fellow resident

247
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:41,657
right before he left...
A guy named Phil Goldstein.

248
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,160
Yeah, come on. I'm driving.

249
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:53,378
I don't understand why
humans waste so much time

250
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,846
resisting their desires.

251
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:57,990
A rehabilitation center
for drugs and sex.

252
00:09:57,993 --> 00:09:59,100
Mr. Goldstein?

253
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,279
Detective Chloe Decker,

254
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:02,517
LAPD. We'd like to
ask you a few questions

255
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,818
about Kevin Winstead.

256
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:06,639
The answer's yes... he's a douchebag.

257
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:08,293
Did you know that he was murdered?

258
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:13,045
No, but it's nice to get
good news for a change.

259
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:15,233
The admin office said that you were gone

260
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:16,601
for a few hours last night

261
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:18,360
during the time of Kevin's murder.

262
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:20,267
So, would you like to
tell us where you were?

263
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,407
I went for a drive.
We're not prisoners here.

264
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,676
Can anyone confirm that?

265
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,878
If producing

266
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:28,879
nine legal shows taught me anything,

267
00:10:28,882 --> 00:10:32,857
it's that I don't have to
say jack without a lawyer.

268
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,589
If you'll excuse me
while I go take a crap.

269
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:39,024
- What are you doing?
- Actually,

270
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:40,524
Phil, I've had enough of your crap!

271
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:42,661
Now, I know that you
killed Kevin Winstead,

272
00:10:42,663 --> 00:10:44,529
and then an angel
interrupted your escape.

273
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:45,964
So, tell me, what did he look like?

274
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:46,897
- Lucifer.
- Man, what the hell

275
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,132
are you talking about, man?

276
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:50,411
Did he look like me?!

277
00:10:50,414 --> 00:10:51,676
Lucifer, stop.

278
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,048
I did not kill Kevin.

279
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:57,281
But you guys did fight, right?

280
00:10:57,284 --> 00:11:00,612
That is only 'cause Kevin took
this rehab stuff so seriously.

281
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:02,847
The rest of us? It's a smoke screen.

282
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:04,349
Keep our wives and jobs at bay.

283
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:06,984
But Kevin wouldn't shut up about

284
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:09,988
getting clean, getting his family back.

285
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,289
He drove me nuts.

286
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,791
So I punched him.

287
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:14,259
Get his family back?

288
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:16,414
I... His parents are dead,
and he wasn't married.

289
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,909
I don't know about any of that.

290
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,339
Where were you last night?

291
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:20,341
Answer her.

292
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:21,495
Uh, uh...

293
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:22,651
Uh, with hookers.

294
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:26,548
That's why I'm in here.

295
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:28,050
I'm a sex addict.

296
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,945
- Ah.
- It's court-ordered.

297
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:32,177
Anyway, you know,

298
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:34,145
two steps forward,

299
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:36,300
one step back, right?

300
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:41,148
Hey, what was that about?

301
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,887
It's nothing.

302
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:44,031
That was not nothing.

303
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:45,183
Talk to me.

304
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:47,094
Look, I just haven't been sleeping well.

305
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:49,063
That's all... but never
mind that, what's next?

306
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:51,438
What's next is you
take the afternoon off.

307
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:52,430
Get some rest.

308
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,255
What? I'd rather go and find the killer.

309
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:55,914
It's not a suggestion, Lucifer.

310
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,602
Look, I'm gonna spend
the rest of the day

311
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:58,805
poring through Kevin's file,

312
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:00,469
trying to figure out who his family is.

313
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:02,595
We probably won't know
anything until tomorrow morning.

314
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,500
Tomorrow?

315
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:05,438
Go home. You're tired.

316
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:09,715
Okay. Fine. But, only
if I can borrow these.

317
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,648
Well, I promise I'll bring them back.

318
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:13,952
Please don't.

319
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:15,454
Ew.

320
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:44,149
Luci.

321
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:45,586
Lucifer.

322
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:48,156
Wake up.

323
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,237
Ugh.

324
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,102
No offense, brother,
but on the list of things

325
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,359
I'd like to wake up to,
your face falls somewhere

326
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:57,170
after a horse's head
and Coldplay tickets.

327
00:12:57,173 --> 00:12:58,940
I just came to show you this.

328
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,467
What...?

329
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:05,471
"The Angel of San Bernardino"?

330
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,673
See, I thought that
maybe one of our siblings

331
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:09,741
was in town.

332
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:10,925
But, Luci,

333
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:12,576
it appears that, uh...

334
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,213
I am the angel.

335
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,796
"Witnesses say the unknown Samaritan

336
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,554
"appeared to have wings.

337
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:23,621
Sort of flew in like..."
This is ludicrous.

338
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:25,005
It-it can't be me.

339
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:26,106
Can it?

340
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:27,141
Luci.

341
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:28,409
Just look around.

342
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:29,877
Look at your hands.

343
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,312
I think it is you, and I
think it's all my fault.

344
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,403
In what possible way is this your fault?

345
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:36,450
Because I made you show
your wings to Charlotte.

346
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:37,507
Reveal divinity.

347
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,331
And now, Father is punishing us for it.

348
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:41,495
Look, Father making me do angelic deeds

349
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:43,457
is a divine kick in the nuts to me.

350
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,426
Well, my punishment must be forthcoming.

351
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:46,527
- What?
- And who knows

352
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,102
in what form it will come.

353
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:50,730
Don't be ridiculous. You
or I aren't being punished

354
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:53,096
for Charlotte Richards,
same as I wasn't punished

355
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,665
for revealing myself to Linda.

356
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,535
Okay, well, then, how do
you explain all of this?

357
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:57,803
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

358
00:13:57,806 --> 00:13:59,906
It's just more manipulation.

359
00:13:59,908 --> 00:14:01,908
Quite possibly, Dad's master
plan all along. I mean,

360
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,444
first, he makes me look
the part of an angel.

361
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:07,053
And then, he forces me
to act it in my sleep.

362
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:08,621
I don't know, Luci.

363
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:10,416
Well, if working with the detective

364
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,586
has taught me anything,
it's that I need proof.

365
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:15,311
Only the killer can say
for certain if it was me.

366
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,736
So I'm off to work.

367
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,459
- Might have a shower and stuff first, huh?
- Yeah.

368
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:25,330
I'll get some takeout, because
being with you is the dessert.

369
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,894
It's a date.

370
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:28,268
Can't wait to see you later.

371
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,871
#Dyingofcuteness.

372
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:32,108
How long have you been there?

373
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:35,208
Long enough to hear how
totally adorbs that was.

374
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,428
Sounds like things
are going really well.

375
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,064
They are. But...

376
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:39,889
But...

377
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,714
There's a "but" in there.

378
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:43,583
I think she's holding back.

379
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:45,803
She hasn't said the magic words.

380
00:14:45,806 --> 00:14:46,972
What magic words?

381
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:48,350
You know.

382
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:50,687
Those three little words.

383
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,893
Rhymes with "my guv boo."

384
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,929
She hasn't said them, yeah.

385
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,931
You and I, we're the same.

386
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:01,074
The rock that people
break themselves against,

387
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:04,538
and you know what
happens to rocks like us?

388
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,974
When we fall, ooh, we fall really hard.

389
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:10,277
Kind of a scary place, huh?

390
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,045
But don't worry, LT.

391
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:14,681
When the time is right, she'll say them.

392
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,349
And, when she finally does...

393
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:19,986
Everything will change.

394
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:22,355
I'm counting on it.

395
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:25,125
Hmm.

396
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:28,228
Your casserole tastes like roadkill.

397
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:30,297
Oh, and you.

398
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,632
Stop telling stories
about your children,

399
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,659
'cause no one cares.

400
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:38,171
Hmm, Sally.

401
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:39,272
Oh, Charlotte.

402
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:41,045
It's not the clothes
that make you look fat.

403
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:42,131
It's the fat.

404
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:43,476
- Ugh.
- Yeah.

405
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:44,920
Oof. And you.

406
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,417
You are pretty great, actually.

407
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,670
Uh, thanks?

408
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:56,556
And you.

409
00:15:56,558 --> 00:15:59,492
You are coming with me.

410
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:00,761
Okay.

411
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:06,665
Mrs. Bell, this is a copy

412
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:08,034
of your son's birth certificate.

413
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:10,350
It says that Kevin
Winstead is the father.

414
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:12,241
Kevin and I dated years ago.

415
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:13,476
We were going to get married

416
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,846
after I got pregnant with Jackson.

417
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,184
But I called it off at the last minute.

418
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:21,655
- Jackson, stop.
- Oh, no, no, no!

419
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:23,250
- No, no.
- No, no, no!

420
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:24,851
- Get off the floor.
- I got it.

421
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,881
Yeah, and people choose to procreate.

422
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,687
I'm afraid my son has Kevin's temper.

423
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,890
But you are

424
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:32,259
the one with the assault charges.

425
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:34,194
I did my share of drugs with Kevin.

426
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:36,284
I'm not proud of who I was then.

427
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,222
Right.

428
00:16:37,225 --> 00:16:38,732
The drugs made you wild.

429
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:41,401
Which is why I stopped using.

430
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:44,537
But Kevin liked getting
high more than he loved me.

431
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:47,240
Our relationship became toxic.

432
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:48,375
So I left.

433
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:49,776
And when was the last time

434
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:51,636
- you spoke to Kevin?
- It's been years.

435
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,280
'Cause it says here on the phone records

436
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:55,181
that he called here three months ago?

437
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:57,292
Every now and then, he
would call, asking for money.

438
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:58,885
For drugs. So, whenever I would see

439
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,220
his name on the caller I.D.,

440
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:02,088
I would just hand the phone to Jeremy.

441
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,791
And did Kevin mention
having trouble with anyone?

442
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:05,926
A drug dealer, maybe?

443
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:06,993
Last time we spoke, he said

444
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:08,395
he owed somebody a lot of money.

445
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:10,030
I didn't care to ask who.

446
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:13,402
Right. Well, I'm not saying this
was a complete waste of time,

447
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:15,802
but... it was.

448
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,417
Mm. So... so then,

449
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,645
I said, "You can stick that brief

450
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:28,214
in the circular file under your robe."

451
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:33,219
Hint: it's his butt.

452
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,959
Aren't you worried about the fallout?

453
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:37,423
I had a big revelation recently,

454
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:40,927
and it's completely
changed my perspective on...

455
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,395
well, everything.

456
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:44,130
It's liberating.

457
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:45,042
Another round.

458
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:46,511
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

459
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:47,767
No, thank you.

460
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,089
- I should go.
- Relax.

461
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:50,937
You only live once.

462
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:52,272
Or...

463
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:54,202
twice, in my case.

464
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:56,988
Look, I would love to, but
if I show up back to work

465
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,639
completely hammered,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

466
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:01,642
I got you covered.

467
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:04,084
I'll put in a word with the big guy.

468
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:05,186
With Pierce?

469
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:06,694
No, think bigger.

470
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:07,829
The commissioner?

471
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:12,827
It's an anadrome for D-O-G.

472
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,731
I love how weird you are.

473
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,230
But I should go.

474
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:20,886
Or, you could duck into that closet,

475
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:22,570
take off all your clothes.

476
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:24,305
I'll go freshen up.

477
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:25,873
Meet you in there.

478
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,576
Then, do the same.

479
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:30,961
That's really not a good idea.

480
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:43,124
Come in.

481
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:46,277
Oh.

482
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,475
What are you doing in here?

483
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:49,896
Uh, I'm... was...

484
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:51,902
- I'm calling the police.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

485
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:53,901
Don't do that, don't do that, please...

486
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:55,506
I am the police.

487
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,009
If I could just, um...

488
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:01,056
Right there.

489
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:07,952
I don't understand.
Why is it taking so long

490
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:09,998
to find Kevin Winstead's drug contacts

491
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:11,577
on your computer thingy?

492
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,858
It's easier said than done, Lucifer.

493
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,261
Well, the man is a degenerate.

494
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:17,295
He must have been
arrested a thousand times.

495
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:20,045
Rich families like the Winsteads,
they're all about appearances.

496
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:22,472
And they've been covering
Kevin's run-ins with the law

497
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:23,792
since he was a teenager.

498
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,333
Look, getting a hit,
it might take some time.

499
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,592
So why don't you go home,
get some sleep and...

500
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:30,204
Look, I can't.

501
00:19:30,206 --> 00:19:31,241
Why?

502
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:33,873
Because if I am this
Angel of San Bernardino,

503
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:35,905
and I go to sleep, then
I might do it again.

504
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,441
Okay, well, just don't sleep then.

505
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:38,709
Hold on.

506
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:40,579
That is an excellent plan, Detective.

507
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:42,182
I'll just never sleep again.

508
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,904
Ah...

509
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:12,633
Oh!

510
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:14,536
Perfect. Harder.

511
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:16,048
Again.

512
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:21,987
Oh!

513
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,624
Come on!

514
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,861
Ha, ha!

515
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:36,824
Put the first layer in...

516
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:40,579
Another scavenger's coming...

517
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:41,781
Hey, Bones, look at that.

518
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:42,741
Mary, right?

519
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,244
Why do you care

520
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:46,479
about my relationship
with my father, Booth?

521
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:56,113
Look, I'm glad you called.

522
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:58,405
Um, but it's just gonna take some time.

523
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:00,245
I'm still upset, and so is Trixie.

524
00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:01,222
I know.

525
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:04,026
I'm fine to take it at
whatever pace you need me to.

526
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:06,162
Fast or slow.

527
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,363
Whatever it takes.

528
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:08,631
Wait, what did you say?

529
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,248
"Fast or slow." Why?

530
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:11,573
It just... nothing.

531
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:13,668
Reminds me of something
someone else said.

532
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,824
Well, if you go by someone else's pace,

533
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:18,774
it shows how much you really care.

534
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:22,178
That's... incredibly insightful.

535
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,210
I learned it from sex.

536
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:25,681
That's more you.

537
00:21:25,683 --> 00:21:27,684
All right, well, thanks, Maze.

538
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,121
Ha.

539
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:34,304
I got your text.

540
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:36,910
Where have you been all week?

541
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:39,361
- Has it been a week? Huh.
- Yes.

542
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:42,608
Um, hey, are you okay?

543
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:45,160
Yeah, I'm fine. Fine.
Rough night, juice cleanse.

544
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:47,436
So what have we got, Booth?

545
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:48,938
Booth?

546
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,706
Yes, the FBI agent on Bones.

547
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,575
- The TV show?
- Uh-huh.

548
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,010
Watched all 12 seasons.
It's riveting stuff.

549
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:56,712
It's like watching a documentary of us.

550
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,355
Actually, you're clearly Booth.

551
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,850
- I'm Bones, obviously.
- Obviously.

552
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,152
Kevin's autopsy report. Good.

553
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:04,620
Now, I've been thinking,

554
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:07,301
perhaps there was a slight
depression on the occipital,

555
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:09,366
or slight fractures to the femur?

556
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,569
Did you know there were
206 bones in a human body?

557
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:13,506
Each of them a clue, sometimes twice.

558
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:15,630
And the coccyx is not what it sounds.

559
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:16,932
No coccyx.

560
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,695
What I did find was surveillance video

561
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:23,358
of Kevin getting arrested for
possession a few months ago.

562
00:22:23,361 --> 00:22:25,273
Oh, goody.

563
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:26,613
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

564
00:22:26,616 --> 00:22:28,272
So who's his doltish

565
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:29,541
- sparring partner?
- Uh,

566
00:22:29,544 --> 00:22:31,379
Matt Kessman, per the arrest report.

567
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:33,649
- Kevin's dealer?
- Uh, I guess so.

568
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,019
I spoke to Kessman's roommate.

569
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,918
He said he's "doing a job" at the
Vido Hotel right now. So if we hurry...

570
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,736
Oh, so if we hurry, we
could catch him in the act.

571
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:42,324
Yes, use it as leverage, get
him to talk about Kevin's murder.

572
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:44,629
Onward, Boothy!

573
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:02,344
Excuse me, everyone.

574
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:03,712
If I could have your attention, please.

575
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:05,181
Oh, excuse me.

576
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,504
In the ER...

577
00:23:06,507 --> 00:23:07,983
- Thank you.
- That's Matt Kessman.

578
00:23:07,985 --> 00:23:10,352
I fix people's hearts with a scalpel.

579
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:12,746
Some say it's a miracle.

580
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:14,423
The real miracle here

581
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:17,059
is how Sheila fixed Kirby's heart.

582
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:20,161
Let's hear it for the
happy couple, huh? Cheers.

583
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:22,798
I find it strange that a heart surgeon

584
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,501
has roommates, and that
he's slugging it out

585
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,305
in an alleyway with a junkie.

586
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:29,352
Detective, I've seen that man before.

587
00:23:29,355 --> 00:23:31,032
What? Where?

588
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:34,410
He's the killer. I'm certain of it.

589
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,979
- What?
- Yeah.

590
00:23:37,572 --> 00:23:39,205
Thank you.

591
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,079
Stop what you're doing. LAPD.

592
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:44,196
Tell me, you murderous drug dealer.

593
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,235
Was it me?

594
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:48,071
Uh, drug dealer? I'm a heart surgeon.

595
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:50,526
Don't even try lying to me.

596
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,194
I know you killed Kevin Winstead.

597
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:55,657
And I know you killed that
intern at the hospital.

598
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,967
Yeah. Burned her body.

599
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:02,360
Only her cranium was left in
the smoldering, smoldering ashes.

600
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:03,772
Lucifer.

601
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:05,808
Lucifer.

602
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:10,614
Are you talking about
an episode of Bones?

603
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:13,482
Wha...?

604
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:15,784
Oh, yes.

605
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,813
Oh, yes, no, I suppose I am, actually.

606
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:20,019
Yes, episode 306.

607
00:24:20,022 --> 00:24:21,824
"The Intern in the Incinerator."

608
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,508
Yes, of course. You were quite good.

609
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,960
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

610
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:26,394
Yeah, that wasn't an easy role.

611
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:27,891
I thought you were a heart surgeon.

612
00:24:27,894 --> 00:24:31,709
- Um...
- This is all my fault.

613
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:34,474
I don't have many friends.

614
00:24:34,477 --> 00:24:36,544
Any friends.

615
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:38,180
So I hired Matt

616
00:24:38,183 --> 00:24:39,408
to be my best man.

617
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,842
Make it look like I know fancy people.

618
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:44,813
Can I go back to my wedding now?

619
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,917
- Uh...
- Yeah, go ahead.

620
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:51,486
You were arrested at the
park for fighting with Kevin.

621
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,774
So why? Did he owe you money? What?

622
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:57,059
We were fighting because he
wouldn't do any drugs with me.

623
00:24:57,061 --> 00:25:00,262
Because that's the
job I was hired to do.

624
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:04,946
So I-I don't understand. So
Kevin was your drug dealer?

625
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:06,735
I'm an actor. Times are tough.

626
00:25:06,737 --> 00:25:08,537
I was hired to be Kevin's friend.

627
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:10,005
Just like the groom.

628
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:12,290
But instead of giving best man speeches,

629
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:14,510
I was supposed to keep him nodding out.

630
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,111
Eh, partying.

631
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:19,352
Who hired you to carry out
this ridiculous charade?

632
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:22,541
No idea. I-I got the
job through the agency

633
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:23,844
that sets it all up.

634
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:25,789
They're called Masquerade, Inc.

635
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,803
Breaking and entering
will get you five years.

636
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,055
You'd have to catch me first.

637
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:46,842
So, you ready for me to kill you yet?

638
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:49,868
No. And you can stop asking me.

639
00:25:49,871 --> 00:25:51,829
I'll let you know when
the brand is finally gone,

640
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:53,266
but don't worry, I think it's soon.

641
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:54,704
Well, I did my part.

642
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:57,040
So what are we thinking?

643
00:25:57,043 --> 00:26:00,155
- Pain or no pain?
- No pain.

644
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:02,282
I've had enough painful
death in my time.

645
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:04,960
Let's keep this last
one quick and clean.

646
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:07,196
No pain it is.

647
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,987
Not for you anyhow.

648
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,282
What?

649
00:26:12,285 --> 00:26:14,673
Decker's the one who's gonna suffer.

650
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:17,196
I got to admit, getting her
to fall for you, and then,

651
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:21,543
poof, vanishing... ruthless.

652
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:25,973
And that's saying something
coming from a demon.

653
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:27,676
Respect.

654
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,326
I don't care who I have to hurt,

655
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:32,924
as long as it allows me to finally die.

656
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:38,914
"No family? No friends? No problem."

657
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:40,851
And for a fee, they'll send actors

658
00:26:40,854 --> 00:26:43,625
to pose as family or friends

659
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:46,728
at public functions for
the sake of appearances.

660
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,690
- That's clever.
- Yeah, well, it's creepy.

661
00:26:48,693 --> 00:26:50,798
At least now we know that whoever hired

662
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:53,516
that exceptionally
talented actor from Bones

663
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,837
may well be our killer. Hmm?

664
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,139
So, um... It says, says here

665
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:01,075
the Masquerade office is
in Hollywood. I'm driving.

666
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,722
Lucifer.

667
00:27:02,725 --> 00:27:05,946
I won't be able to get a
warrant until tomorrow morning.

668
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:07,348
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

669
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,398
It-it is imperative that we go now.

670
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:11,437
It's imperative that you sleep.

671
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,589
You clearly...

672
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:14,050
I can't sleep!

673
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:18,725
Detective, I can't sleep.

674
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:34,552
Lucifer.

675
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,805
- I've had it.
- What... you won't understand, really.

676
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:41,115
- Hmm?
- It's my wings. They're back.

677
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,898
My Father, he's manipulating me.

678
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:44,992
He's making me do things
that I would never do.

679
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,654
What? Like flying through the night,

680
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:48,223
helping people like some rogue angel?

681
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:49,791
- Yes! Yes, exactly!
- Uh-huh.

682
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,589
That is the only plausible explanation.

683
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:54,859
Either that or Linda's
right, and I'm suppressing

684
00:27:54,862 --> 00:27:57,332
pent-up feelings about you and Pierce,

685
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:59,634
which is obviously absurd.

686
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,159
You hate that I'm with him.

687
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:04,019
I couldn't care less that you're
with that insolent dullard.

688
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:05,516
We both know that's not true,

689
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,523
but what I want to know is
why it bothers you so much.

690
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:13,961
Because, Detective, I happen
to know him better than you,

691
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:15,797
and I know that you can't trust him.

692
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,305
Care to elaborate on that?

693
00:28:17,308 --> 00:28:19,219
I... Yeah.

694
00:28:19,222 --> 00:28:22,081
Fine, I will, because you
deserve to know the truth.

695
00:28:22,084 --> 00:28:23,487
Yes, okay.

696
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,690
Pierce isn't Pierce.

697
00:28:25,693 --> 00:28:27,748
He's Cain from the Bible.

698
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,666
And he's immortal. He's
been around for eons.

699
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:31,602
And all he cares about
is ridding himself

700
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:34,004
of that stupid curse that
my Father put on him...

701
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:36,538
- Because he killed his brother.
- Stop. Stop!

702
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,320
- You're tired, and you're not thinking clearly.
- No...

703
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:41,139
No, I'm... it's not because
I'm tired, Detective!

704
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:42,070
And...

705
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:45,413
But since you brought it up,

706
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:50,218
let me tell you what
I think about Marcus.

707
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,721
He is a good man

708
00:28:53,723 --> 00:28:55,526
who treats me right.

709
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:59,160
And I'm happy, Lucifer.

710
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:02,971
And all I know is how I
feel when I'm around him,

711
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,242
and, you know, I l...

712
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:07,403
I...

713
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:10,948
We're done here.

714
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:20,594
Seven carats

715
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:22,602
of pure bliss.

716
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:25,787
Don't you deserve a little indulgence?

717
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:27,105
I'll take it.

718
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:29,242
Hey.

719
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:30,491
You got a second?

720
00:29:30,493 --> 00:29:32,794
For you, Amenadiel, always.

721
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:34,808
Don't go too far.

722
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:42,236
Dan called me. He's worried about you.

723
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:46,430
Well, all is good. In
fact, it's better than good.

724
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:47,758
It's perfect.

725
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:49,976
Yeah, what about that Spartan lifestyle?

726
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:52,980
What can I say? Things change.

727
00:29:52,982 --> 00:29:54,182
And why is that?

728
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:56,511
Because when you know

729
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:58,080
a pair of angels that can

730
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,250
zip you up to Heaven
when the time comes,

731
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:02,120
worrying is a waste of time.

732
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:08,807
That's not how it works, Charlotte.

733
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,344
- What do you mean?
- Okay, look.

734
00:30:11,347 --> 00:30:15,695
Neither I nor Lucifer have the
power to get anyone into Heaven.

735
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:17,238
I don't have my wings,

736
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,941
and Lucifer, well,

737
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:22,297
he is, uh, most unwelcome.

738
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,281
So the only thing that matters,

739
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:26,347
Charlotte, truly, is who you are.

740
00:30:26,349 --> 00:30:28,783
It's okay.

741
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,184
Nothing's changed.

742
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:33,754
No, don't you see? That's the problem.

743
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:36,290
The second I thought I had a free pass,

744
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,659
an excuse not to be good,

745
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:42,997
I relapsed into my old ways,

746
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:44,878
into who I really am.

747
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:52,874
There's no hope for me.

748
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:55,377
Amenadiel, I can't change.

749
00:30:58,284 --> 00:31:00,198
I'm going to Hell.

750
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:14,328
- Mommy.
- Hmm?

751
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,343
Did you know if you're ever mean to me,

752
00:31:16,346 --> 00:31:18,945
I can just go on this
site and order a new mommy?

753
00:31:18,948 --> 00:31:20,975
Oh, yeah? How you gonna pay for that?

754
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:22,445
Your credit card.

755
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:25,106
I've gotten pretty good at
your signature, you know.

756
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:27,441
I don't doubt that. All right, come on.

757
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:29,477
Let's go get some pizza and ice cream

758
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,645
on the way home.

759
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:33,915
He seems nice.

760
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:37,956
He is nice. You know, Monkey,

761
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,625
since Daddy,

762
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:44,402
I haven't really dated
anyone... well, seriously.

763
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:45,471
And, uh...

764
00:31:45,474 --> 00:31:46,773
Marcus and I,

765
00:31:46,776 --> 00:31:49,430
we've been spending a
lot of time together.

766
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:53,562
And the truth is... I like him, a lot.

767
00:31:53,565 --> 00:31:57,279
And it's just so important to
me that you're okay with that.

768
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,690
Is he the reason you've
been so happy lately?

769
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:03,744
I think so.

770
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:06,147
Does he like chocolate cake?

771
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:07,715
You know what, I don't know.

772
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,151
Let's ask him.

773
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,688
All right.

774
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,991
Oh, my God.

775
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,560
What is it, Mommy?

776
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,266
That's Jeremy Bell.

777
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:23,864
The husband we interviewed.

778
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:25,792
Hello?

779
00:32:30,673 --> 00:32:32,315
Anyone there?

780
00:32:43,058 --> 00:32:44,987
Trouble sleeping?

781
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,330
Mr. Morningstar, what
are you doing here?

782
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:59,399
Shh. It's probably best
not to wake your family.

783
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:03,137
Even though...

784
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:04,672
they're not your family.

785
00:33:04,674 --> 00:33:06,491
I just came from Masquerade

786
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:09,073
where a most cooperative employee

787
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:11,546
helped me connect the dots.

788
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:14,549
So, you used to be an actor.

789
00:33:14,551 --> 00:33:16,651
We're in L.A., everybody
used to be an actor.

790
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:19,787
Mm-hmm, but not everyone gets
such a cushy gig, do they?

791
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,655
Your so-called wife

792
00:33:21,658 --> 00:33:24,765
worried she'd no longer
fit in with the classes

793
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:28,229
after she broke it off with
her deadbeat baby daddy,

794
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:31,679
hired you to play husband and father.

795
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:33,701
Murdering to keep the gig?

796
00:33:33,703 --> 00:33:35,970
That seems a tad
method, don't you think?

797
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,105
Murder?

798
00:33:37,107 --> 00:33:38,899
Th-That's crazy.

799
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:40,368
All right, look, you need to leave

800
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:41,585
or I'm gonna call the police.

801
00:33:41,588 --> 00:33:43,666
Oh, please. Spare me the theatrics

802
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:45,202
because I am in no mood

803
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:47,614
to hear the half-baked
recitation of innocence

804
00:33:47,617 --> 00:33:51,127
by a, well, mediocre actor.

805
00:33:57,211 --> 00:33:58,944
Was it mediocre acting

806
00:33:58,947 --> 00:34:02,018
that got Mary to actually
fall in love with me?

807
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:04,960
And Kevin's reappearance
just put all that in jeopardy.

808
00:34:04,963 --> 00:34:06,783
Yeah, I wasn't about to let that loser

809
00:34:06,786 --> 00:34:08,963
weasel his way back in here.

810
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:11,705
Just like I'm not gonna
let you mess it up, either.

811
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:14,742
Too bad you're trespassing.

812
00:34:16,897 --> 00:34:18,196
What the hell?

813
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,807
Most kind of you to admit your guilt.

814
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,648
The trying to kill me part, less so.

815
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:22,750
Aah!

816
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:25,604
Now, tell me what I really want to know.

817
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,241
- Am I the angel?
- What angel?!

818
00:34:28,244 --> 00:34:30,090
Did I stop you from
killing that old woman?

819
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:32,160
What happened the
night you killed Kevin?!

820
00:34:32,162 --> 00:34:33,494
Okay. I'll tell you.

821
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:35,101
After I shot him, I ran out.

822
00:34:35,104 --> 00:34:36,464
I bumped into that old lady.

823
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:37,885
But there was nobody else there.

824
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:40,667
She fell into some kind of
religious trance so I bolted!

825
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,070
She saw an angel!

826
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:43,871
- Was it me?!
- No! I...

827
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,874
It was a-a shadow
from-from those figurines.

828
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,843
With the figurines, the
angel figurines. Did you plant

829
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:50,144
- the figurine in my bedroom?!
- No, no.

830
00:34:50,146 --> 00:34:51,713
I-I touched one of them.

831
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,769
So I took it, but it
had my prints on it.

832
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:55,749
I destroyed it right after. I swear.

833
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:58,853
Then... how...

834
00:35:00,857 --> 00:35:05,460
I was only trying to protect my family.

835
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:08,135
It was never your family to protect,

836
00:35:08,138 --> 00:35:10,064
you pathetic imposter.

837
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,199
You stole it

838
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:13,001
from Kevin Winstead.

839
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:15,205
And then you kept him distracted

840
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,984
by hiring someone to
keep the party going.

841
00:35:17,987 --> 00:35:20,413
Driving him to self-destruction,

842
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:24,747
stoking the very fires
of his own weakness...

843
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:28,150
to keep him out of the way.

844
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:30,886
How could I be so blind?

845
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:45,151
Jeremy Bell? LAPD.

846
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,979
It's all my fault.

847
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:54,643
I killed Kevin Winstead.

848
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,432
I am a pathetic imposter.

849
00:36:10,427 --> 00:36:12,160
What are you doing?

850
00:36:12,162 --> 00:36:13,882
I need to find it, Maze.

851
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:14,996
Find what?

852
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:16,297
Your self-respect?

853
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,140
The-the angel figurine.
It's here somewhere.

854
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,735
I-I need to find it so that I can

855
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:23,151
convince the detective that Pierce...

856
00:36:23,154 --> 00:36:25,087
isn't who she thinks he is.

857
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,605
What? I don't understand. Explain.

858
00:36:27,608 --> 00:36:29,538
I figured it out, haven't I?

859
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,515
Pierce has been gaslighting me.

860
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:32,649
He's been tricking me into thinking

861
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:35,482
I've been doing good deeds in my sleep.

862
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:36,784
Why would he do that?

863
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:37,838
Because...

864
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,786
to keep me away from the detective

865
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:41,283
so he can pursue her.

866
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:43,588
He must be back to thinking
that she's the key to lifting

867
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:44,869
his bloody curse.

868
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,187
I mean, I tried to warn her,

869
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,929
but she wouldn't listen, would she?

870
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:49,297
And why wouldn't she listen?

871
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:51,109
Because the detective
always needs proof.

872
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:53,835
And what better proof than
that trinket that he used

873
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,405
to-to-to deceive me?

874
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,527
Wait.

875
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:04,788
If you want Chloe to believe you,

876
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,948
you have to do it right.

877
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,550
Take it to Ellen. Have
her do her lab thingy.

878
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:11,185
Yes, yes, you're right.

879
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,522
First, back up. Tell me everything.

880
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,268
Start at the beginning.

881
00:37:16,271 --> 00:37:18,226
And don't leave a single thing out.

882
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:20,448
It's just...

883
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:25,059
so hard to put everything
together in my mind, Maze.

884
00:37:25,062 --> 00:37:26,823
I mean, you-you wouldn't understand.

885
00:37:26,826 --> 00:37:28,336
Thank you.

886
00:37:28,338 --> 00:37:29,643
That's very kind of you.

887
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,288
Which is not like you at all.

888
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,721
Why are you even here?

889
00:37:41,073 --> 00:37:43,818
You're helping him. Aren't you?

890
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,487
"Helping him"?

891
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:49,391
This was my idea.

892
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:53,060
After Pierce told me

893
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,773
about that old lady who
thought she saw an angel,

894
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:58,948
that's when it all came together.

895
00:38:01,136 --> 00:38:06,006
I planted the figurine by your bed.

896
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:11,412
My neck... is still jacked
from wearing those fake wings

897
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,601
to save that dumb family

898
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:14,320
in San Bernardino.

899
00:38:14,323 --> 00:38:17,652
You came this close the
other night to waking up

900
00:38:17,654 --> 00:38:19,587
after I took those handcuffs off.

901
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:23,382
Thankfully, handcuffs
in bed, I got that.

902
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,963
Why would you do this to me, Mazikeen?

903
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:29,730
Because I know the only thing

904
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:32,112
that matters to you more than Chloe.

905
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:35,369
You.

906
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:37,707
Easiest way to spin you out.

907
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,210
Tap into those daddy issues.

908
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:42,710
"I can't get rid of my wings.

909
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:45,346
Daddy's controlling me."

910
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:49,116
Wah, wah, wah.

911
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,824
You're stalling me.

912
00:38:51,827 --> 00:38:53,421
Aren't you?

913
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:55,812
I need to get to the detective!

914
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,827
Hi.

915
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,182
What do you have?

916
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:19,387
You're lucky you're cute

917
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,004
because I hate surprises.

918
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:24,986
Come on. Let me see.

919
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,241
To celebrate solving a murder.

920
00:39:28,772 --> 00:39:31,233
Mm, my second favorite
kind of six-pack.

921
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,894
Thank you.

922
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:35,763
And this.

923
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:38,215
I'm more of a key lime pie guy myself,

924
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:41,269
but every proper bribe
requires self-sacrifice.

925
00:39:41,271 --> 00:39:43,184
Trixie is gonna love this.

926
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:44,305
- It's her favorite.
- Hmm.

927
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:45,622
She's at a birthday party right now.

928
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:46,841
Oh, birthday party.

929
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,014
Maybe she's already had
enough cake for the evening.

930
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:53,718
Well, then maybe we can
all share it together

931
00:39:53,721 --> 00:39:55,421
tomorrow morning for breakfast.

932
00:39:55,424 --> 00:39:57,805
You mean I don't have to sneak
out of the house in the morning

933
00:39:57,807 --> 00:39:58,851
like a teenager?

934
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,421
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you sure?

935
00:40:00,423 --> 00:40:01,622
Oh, I'm sure.

936
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:04,758
Yeah. I-I'm done walking on eggshells.

937
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,889
I'm done worrying about how
this affects everybody else

938
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:12,833
because the way that
I feel about you is...

939
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:15,929
just... don't get a big head.

940
00:40:15,932 --> 00:40:17,932
All right? We're both adults

941
00:40:17,935 --> 00:40:19,842
and it's not that big a deal.

942
00:40:19,845 --> 00:40:21,685
But anyhow, here it goes. Um...

943
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:28,103
I... really...

944
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:29,804
like spending time with you.

945
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:32,142
And I know why.

946
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:34,807
Because, Pierce, I l...

947
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,344
Stop.

948
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,900
I can't do this.

949
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,760
What? Wait, no.

950
00:40:40,763 --> 00:40:41,939
Marcus, don't freak out.

951
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:43,630
I mean, I know that this is scary,

952
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:45,499
but sometimes you-you just

953
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,436
have to take a leap of faith. You know?

954
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,594
Hold on.

955
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:49,796
Did something happen?

956
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:52,439
Did... is it something I did or said?

957
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:55,542
Because, look, we can take this slow.

958
00:40:55,544 --> 00:40:56,580
I just thought that...

959
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,178
You're just making this too hard.

960
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,213
What?

961
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:00,314
It's not worth it.

962
00:41:00,316 --> 00:41:02,549
I'm not worth it?

963
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:04,718
- I have to go.
- What?

964
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,023
Why?!

965
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:19,022
Why did you hurt her? Why?!

966
00:42:19,025 --> 00:42:22,396
For the first time, I had it.

967
00:42:22,398 --> 00:42:24,041
It was right there in my grasp.

968
00:42:25,049 --> 00:42:28,501
The one thing I always wanted.

969
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,478
It was so close.

970
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,539
I just had to have her say the words.

971
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:34,174
But I couldn't.

972
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,185
I couldn't do that to her.

973
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,205
I couldn't...

974
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,408
hurt her like that.

975
00:42:41,411 --> 00:42:43,616
Well, you hurt her plenty.

976
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:45,314
And now?

977
00:42:45,317 --> 00:42:47,854
I'm gonna hurt you.

978
00:42:51,627 --> 00:42:54,828
Get up. Come on.

979
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:59,166
You do what you have to do, Lucifer.

980
00:42:59,169 --> 00:43:00,733
I deserve it.

981
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:02,580
Your mark...

982
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,139
it's gone.
