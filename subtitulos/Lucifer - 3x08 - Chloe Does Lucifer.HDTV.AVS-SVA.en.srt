1
00:00:00,962 --> 00:00:03,408
- Previously on Lucifer...
- We're separated.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,040
Sign the divorce papers.

3
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:07,879
What's with the cold
shoulder? You seduced me.

4
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:10,048
You almost die, and then
you ghost me for weeks.

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,942
Nothing about any of that
makes any sense to me.

6
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,867
Doesn't make any sense to me, either.

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,589
I used to see a light in you.
All I see now is darkness.

8
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:19,791
I just wanted to say thank you

9
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:21,351
for saving my life.

10
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,625
Take her gun.

11
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:23,694
He saved my life.

12
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:24,729
Chloe's fine.

13
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:25,836
Luckily, Pierce was with her.

14
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:26,938
But I wasn't.

15
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:29,661
- Happy birthday, Detective.
- Beautiful.

16
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:31,572
- What is it?
- It's the bullet.

17
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:32,707
From when you shot me.

18
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,484
Oh.

19
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:42,013
Mm, this is a new one on me, Detective.

20
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:44,749
Mm, mm, well,

21
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,318
there's a first time for everything.

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,853
Yes, but I've heard it can take hours.

23
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:49,788
I'm not sure even I have
the endurance for that.

24
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,290
- Mm...
- Don't worry, I'll help you.

25
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,292
I'll be the top hat.

26
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:56,228
I will be the race car,

27
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,431
because I'm gonna leave
you both in the dust.

28
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,732
Very funny.

29
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:02,442
Uh, wheelbarrow,

30
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:03,953
shoe, ah...

31
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:05,622
Guess I'm gonna have
to be the shot glass.

32
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,606
- Cheers.
- Oh, that's a thimble.

33
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:11,009
What? What? I want to conquer
real estate, not mend socks.

34
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:12,661
- So then be the shoe.
- Please,

35
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:13,678
I am not a shoe.

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,214
Clearly I'm a top hat,
so come on, hand it over.

37
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:18,950
Want it? It's gonna cost you.

38
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:23,179
Oh, well, name your price, urchin.

39
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:25,614
Oh, I'm not talking fake money.

40
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:27,759
Oh, wow, she slammed you.

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,546
Imagine my disappointment

42
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:50,815
when I realized there
was no raging party.

43
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:52,684
It's a security thing.

44
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:54,152
Worked for that Home Alone kid,

45
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:56,000
but, obviously, you can't take a hint.

46
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:57,989
Wasn't I being clear last
time I kicked you out?

47
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,858
Oh, clearly being a jerk.

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,528
Which is exactly why I
came to look in on you.

49
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,664
You see, we need the most love

50
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,965
when we're being most unlovable.

51
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:09,100
No offense, Brother, but
I don't need love from you.

52
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:10,735
I get plenty from naked strangers.

53
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:12,370
And speaking of, I'm spent.

54
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:13,351
So, if you don't mind...

55
00:02:13,354 --> 00:02:14,422
That's where you've been, then,

56
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:16,476
having sex with the nameless masses?

57
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,145
Oh, you know me, Brother,
wine, women and song.

58
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:22,447
Just, come on, run along.
I don't need a babysitter.

59
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:26,117
Your cheek says otherwise.

60
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:29,854
Well, it turns out
"Bruce Lee mid-fly kick"

61
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:31,856
wasn't in the artist's repertoire.

62
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:36,461
Look, I had to cut a deal
with the detective's offspring.

63
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:38,830
So that's who you were with...

64
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:40,432
Chloe and Trixie.

65
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:42,467
Well, so much for wine, women and song.

66
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,636
Technically, all of those
things were represented,

67
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:47,257
when you count the post-game karaoke.

68
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,008
Luci, there's absolutely
nothing wrong with...

69
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,110
with enjoying a quiet night in.

70
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:54,098
I did not say that I enjoyed it.

71
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:56,247
Yeah, right. Honestly, Luci, who cares

72
00:02:56,249 --> 00:02:58,350
how you spend your nights?

73
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,418
Um, everyone.

74
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,188
My exciting lifestyle
gives regular people

75
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,523
something to aspire
to... I provide hope.

76
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:07,993
I see. And how does
Linda feel about this

77
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:09,260
little ruse of yours?

78
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:11,830
I'm sure that the doctor
would love to dissect me,

79
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:13,064
but she's taken some time off

80
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,273
to deal with a death
in the family, so...

81
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:18,970
I had no idea.

82
00:03:18,972 --> 00:03:20,879
I should go check on her.

83
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:23,742
Yes, excellent idea. You do that.

84
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:27,045
Luci, I'm liking this new you.

85
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:28,647
Boring suits you, Brother.

86
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:33,661
Now, this poor victim,

87
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:35,086
she is boring.

88
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:37,840
- We don't know anything about her.
- Oh, don't we?

89
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,392
Generic artwork, dull clothes,

90
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:41,760
beige furniture.

91
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,062
I mean, even her fruit
bowl's so tragically safe...

92
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:45,630
No mangoes, no papayas.

93
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,198
Not even a measly avocado.

94
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,501
Her name's Kim Jones, 29.

95
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:50,602
She's a computer engineer.

96
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,370
We ran a full background check,

97
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:54,223
but we couldn't find
anything noteworthy.

98
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,241
A fellow nerd.

99
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:58,176
I'm sure you're in a better place now.

100
00:03:58,178 --> 00:03:59,946
Well, even if she's in the worst place,

101
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,646
it'd be far more interesting than this,

102
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:03,981
because this poor
lady, definitely a shoe.

103
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:05,887
Any idea what he's talking about?

104
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,787
Oh, the other night we played Monopoly.

105
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,922
So, that's that story.

106
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:12,090
Ella, what's the cause of death?

107
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,425
Uh, BABFT.

108
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:14,661
Hmm?

109
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:16,761
Big-ass blunt force trauma to the head.

110
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:18,596
Murder weapon's missing,

111
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:22,200
but we are looking for
something small and compact.

112
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:25,236
Surprisingly heavy for its size.

113
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:26,938
Kind of like my Aunt Rosalita.

114
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,440
I wish Amenadiel were
here so he could see

115
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:30,208
what boring actually looks like.

116
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,340
Can you believe that he
said I've become boring?

117
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:33,442
It's absurd.

118
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:34,512
Oh, I don't know.

119
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:36,748
Monopoly doesn't really
sound like the old Lucifer.

120
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,585
And I have to say, you have become a bit

121
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,051
more normal.

122
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:41,734
- How dare you.
- Crazy idea.

123
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:44,222
Let's talk less about Lucifer
and more about the murder.

124
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:46,137
Crime-scene selfies? Really?

125
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,759
Classy move.

126
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:50,762
And that is Esther,
our victim's roommate.

127
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:53,264
She found the body when
she came home from partying.

128
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:55,533
Well, what's such a
dynamic young lady doing

129
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:56,935
living with a... Kim?

130
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:59,037
Oh, never mind, she looks traumatized.

131
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,590
- I'll go comfort her.
- Uh-huh.

132
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,574
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Hel...

133
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:04,843
No photos at a crime scene.

134
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:06,578
Sorry.

135
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,381
Not even one last one
with the handsome cop?

136
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,650
Don't let the boring
detective spoil things.

137
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:14,070
It would be my pleasure.

138
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:16,921
Right.

139
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:19,085
Oh.

140
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:20,592
Bless your heart.

141
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:22,961
Obviously, I'm far too well-dressed

142
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:24,028
to be a cop.

143
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,131
So, I take it that

144
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,933
you aren't close with your roommate?

145
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:32,368
No, I don't spend much time here.

146
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:34,815
Obviously. Besides, me and Kim,

147
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:36,975
totally different squads.

148
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:40,145
Kim followed more
people than followed her,

149
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:41,646
if you know what I mean.

150
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:43,014
#Shoe.

151
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:45,183
Can you think of anyone
who would want her dead?

152
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:48,953
I don't think anyone wanted
much of anything from Kim.

153
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:50,355
Okay, well, there was no break-in,

154
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:52,323
there was no struggle,
which likely means

155
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:53,358
that Kim knew the killer.

156
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,926
So, can you think of anything?

157
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,089
A recent breakup, a fight?

158
00:05:57,092 --> 00:05:59,197
She did get into a yelling match

159
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,139
- on the phone last night
- Oh.

160
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:04,402
but I assume that was with
the Thai delivery place.

161
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:05,970
And I assume that's the poor dear's

162
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:07,172
closest relationship?

163
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:09,440
What time was the... the argument?

164
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:10,375
I'll tell you

165
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:12,198
if you hand me my phone back.

166
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,287
I was getting ready to go out,

167
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,216
and I totally remember the pic
I was uploading at the time.

168
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:22,782
There: Kombucha Martini. 10:39 p.m.

169
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:25,245
All right, I'll trace Kim's
phone call at that time.

170
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:29,160
You guys mind if I post
that I'm totes helping

171
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:30,628
a police investigation?

172
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,834
Absolutely.

173
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:33,431
Do you mind tagging me?

174
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:39,838
Ella traced Kim's call to this business.

175
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,473
Top Meet. Interesting
name for a Thai restaurant.

176
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:45,944
No, it's a dating app for
L.A.'s most fabulous singles.

177
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:47,178
Super exclusive.

178
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,847
Seems you need to get recommended

179
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,882
and meet a bunch of selection criteria,

180
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:52,951
even go through an interview
just to create an account.

181
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:55,720
Well, then, why would our victim
be arguing with someone here?

182
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:58,656
I mean, this is clearly a
place for top hats, like us.

183
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:01,059
Please, I would never get
into something like this.

184
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:02,360
Eh, you're right. What was I thinking?

185
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:05,797
It's way too exciting for
you, Detective... I meant me.

186
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,866
And him.

187
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:09,803
Gosh, kindred souls.

188
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,303
This interesting young fellow
and I, wouldn't you say?

189
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:14,038
Except that, apparently,

190
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,307
he's slightly more interesting than you.

191
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:18,238
Well, journalistic hyperbole, clearly.

192
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:19,370
- Eh...
- Can I help you?

193
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,581
Oh.

194
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:24,018
Mack Slater. I'm the CEO.

195
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:27,085
If you are here for
the selection interview,

196
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:28,686
I'll spare you. I created Top Meet

197
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:30,321
for people exactly like you.

198
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:31,956
Oh, well, thank you very much.

199
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,958
I'm actually... I was
talking to the lady.

200
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,794
You're exactly my type.

201
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:38,725
I mean the app's type.

202
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,264
Bit on the nose there, Big Mack.

203
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,166
We're here for a different
kind of interview.

204
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:44,602
There's been a murder,
and our victim's last call

205
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:46,128
was to someone in this building.

206
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:48,120
A homicide detective, huh?

207
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:51,381
- Uh-huh.
- Wow. You just got even more interesting.

208
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:53,645
Funny, so did you.

209
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:57,181
Just found out who our victim
was fighting with... you.

210
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,351
Ah. Most interesting bachelor, indeed.

211

212
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:10,432
If you didn't know her, then
how did you fight with her?

213
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:12,509
'Cause she was nuts.

214
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:14,577
I'm confused, you just
said you didn't know her.

215
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,312
I know her type.

216
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:17,714
We get them from time to time.

217
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:19,816
They want to be on Top Meet,

218
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:21,584
they can't clear our high bar,

219
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:23,286
and then they get pissed about it.

220
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:25,427
Problem with her was she just
wouldn't take no for an answer.

221
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:28,351
And then, uh, she hacked
her way onto my app,

222
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:29,959
and then our users
complained, of course.

223
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:33,463
Because nobody joins Top
Meet to hook up with some...

224
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:36,199
random nobody, and so
we had to kick her off.

225
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:37,734
Okay, and is that when she got angry

226
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:38,768
and called to complain?

227
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,155
No, it was more like she went psycho.

228
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:43,640
Ah, well, boring people never
like to be told they're dull.

229
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:44,774
Right, Detective?

230
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:46,543
What did you do after the call?

231
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:48,378
I stayed here, I worked late.

232
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,346
We've been busy as hell these days.

233
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:51,848
Not nearly, I can assure you.

234
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,718
Well, I'd like to talk to anyone
who can corroborate your alibi.

235
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,753
Also, I'll need a list
of any of the users

236
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:57,854
that complained about Kim.

237
00:08:57,856 --> 00:08:58,960
No can do.

238
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:00,323
With so many celebrity clients,

239
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:02,525
our entire business model is based off

240
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:04,461
our ironclad privacy protocols.

241
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:06,496
Fine, I'll just get a warrant.

242
00:09:06,498 --> 00:09:07,597
Good luck with that.

243
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,299
I mean, how long did it take the FBI

244
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:10,667
to hack one cell phone?

245
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:18,374
Yep, I'll have the tech team get on it.

246
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:20,977
You got it, Chloe. Ah!

247
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:22,679
Hello, Ms. Lopez.

248
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:26,483
I wanted to ask you something.

249
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:30,220
You know this darkness
that you say you see in me?

250
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:32,522
- Mm-hmm.
- I've been trying to address it,

251
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:34,582
and, uh, details would help.

252
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:37,727
So, where do you see it, exactly?

253
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:39,329
How? When?

254
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:41,297
Like, now.

255
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:42,999
Right about there.

256
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:45,335
Oh.

257
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:47,103
Hmm.

258
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:48,438
Little better?

259
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,873
But you know, still,

260
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,941
you don't exactly scream
rainbows and sunshine,

261
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:54,152
even when you're not
wielding murder weapons.

262
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:56,513
Well, for the record,
I wouldn't stab you,

263
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:58,848
not here, with all these cops around.

264
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:02,687
Oh, come on, that was funny.

265
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,725
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. Funny.

266
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:07,293
Also dark.

267
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,958
Right. Fair point.

268
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,794
But it's cool.

269
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:13,210
You know, being dark.

270
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,064
To each their own, you know?

271
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,400
Wow, you really have this
"being good" thing down.

272
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:18,768
Huh?

273
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,305
You know, you might be
just the person to guide me.

274
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:23,569
To where?

275
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:26,843
Somewhere other than Hell.

276
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:29,412
See, I've, um, I've learned

277
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:32,882
that there are
consequences to my darkness.

278
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:36,052
Really permanent ones, as it turns out.

279
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:39,522
And I was thinking you
could help me avoid them?

280
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:40,590
No way, José.

281
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:43,733
I mean, I wish I could help you, I do,

282
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,829
but I'm so busy.

283
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:47,507
- With what?
- You know.

284
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,899
Cases, forensic stuff.

285
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:52,235
The lieutenant won't be
back from medical leave

286
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:55,371
until next week, so it's,
like, cray-cray up in here.

287
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:57,882
Oh, hey, Dan.

288
00:10:57,885 --> 00:11:00,109
I bet you need me to
go do that thing, huh?

289
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:02,345
That super urgent forensic thing.

290
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:03,646
Yeah, yeah. See?

291
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:06,349
Cray-cray.

292
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:09,319
Well...

293
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:10,620
I'm just gonna...

294
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:12,255
- I was...
- Yeah.

295
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:14,424
Bye.

296
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,793
Excuse me.

297
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:19,168
You know, you're exposing yourself

298
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:21,064
to dreadful consequences.

299
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:22,832
And I'm not talking bad Yelp reviews,

300
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,334
I'm talking Hell.

301
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:26,169
Turns out: real.

302
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:27,370
I know.

303
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:28,805
I know, right?

304
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,240
Shocker to me, too.

305
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:34,319
But not as much as your dancing
queen candle arrangements!

306
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:35,555
Hey,

307
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:36,590
Linda.

308
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:38,982
- Is everything okay?
- Amenadiel, hi.

309
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,416
I'm so glad you're here.

310
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:42,452
I'm trying to plan my
ex-husband's memorial,

311
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:45,321
and I could really use another opinion.

312
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:48,625
Um, okay. So, which
one do you like best?

313
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:50,755
Just, knee-jerk reaction.

314
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:51,918
Go.

315
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,529
That one?

316
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:57,367
Really? You don't think it's too ornate?

317
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:58,324
That one.

318
00:11:58,327 --> 00:11:59,335
You're right.

319
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:01,804
This one's simple, yet elegant.

320
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:03,840
See, you're just the insight I needed.

321
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:05,074
Busy tomorrow?

322
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:09,779
That looks absolutely nothing

323
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:11,280
like our victim.

324
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:12,715
Take note, Daniel. These filters

325
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:14,270
could be the answer
to your dating drought.

326
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:15,451
Or not... I mean,

327
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:16,853
Kim only got one match.

328
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:18,187
What... really?

329
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:19,756
After all the effort
our shoe went through

330
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:21,024
to make herself look like a top hat,

331
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:22,825
she only got the
interest of one gentleman?

332
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:24,937
Gentleman? You mean suspect.

333
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,497
Yep. Username, FOREVER29.

334
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:28,731
The app arranged a date for them,

335
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,396
and based on their likes and locations,

336
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,332
it suggested a sushi place on Melrose.

337
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,059
Even made a reservation for
them for the night of the murder.

338
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:36,316
This guy's using the app

339
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,508
as a hunting ground; he could
be targeting somebody right now.

340
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,676
We got to find him.

341
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:41,663
Yeah, but how? We can't even get an I.D.

342
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,379
Yeah. Tech team hasn't
been able to crack

343
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:44,647
Top Meet's security algo.

344
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:47,824
Which means Kim had mad hacking skills.

345
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:49,953
So can we use FOREVER29's profile pic

346
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:51,688
and run it through facial recognition?

347
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,456
Yeah, I know, I thought
about that, but...

348
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:55,892
Partial profiles pics.

349
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:57,794
Such a telltale sign
of low self-esteem.

350
00:12:57,796 --> 00:12:59,262
Or our guy's keeping his profile secret

351
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:00,530
because he's the killer.

352
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:02,565
Wait a minute, there is
some good news, you guys.

353
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:05,368
He used the app to RSVP
for a mixer at Top Meet.

354
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,436
It's happening tonight.

355
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:07,937
Okay. We got to get to this party.

356
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:10,073
Use what we know about
FOREVER29 and single him out.

357
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:11,366
Okay, fine. I'll go.

358
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:13,376
Seeing as I'm the only
interesting single person here,

359
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:15,511
I think I'm our one shot
to catching the killer.

360
00:13:15,513 --> 00:13:16,846
Lucifer, we're looking for a guy.

361
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:17,714
Your point?

362
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:18,548
Uh...

363
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,216
He's a dude. And he's straight.

364
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:21,851
That's never stopped me before, Daniel.

365
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:24,220
I'm so good at flipping men,
they call me The Skillet.

366
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,621
- Oh, wow.
- Okay.

367
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:27,265
We need a woman, so I'll go.

368
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:30,560
What? You, Detective?
Socialize and flirt? Come on.

369
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:33,763
Yeah, but for the
investigation, I can sacrifice.

370
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:36,366
Can't be that hard being
frivolous and shallow.

371
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:38,434
I'll just channel my inner Lucifer.

372
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:40,603
What, you want to become
a female version of me?

373
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:41,871
Okay.

374
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:43,106
I'll gladly train you.

375
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:45,408
Chloe does Lucifer?

376
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,909
I wouldn't exactly word it that way...

377
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:49,445
Get ready to go full me, Detective.

378
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:55,308
Oh, the Paris shows were glorious.

379
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:56,677
Yes, worth the jetlag alone.

380
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,812
How was your weekend?

381
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:59,612
Uh, awesome. Great.

382
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:02,116
Uh, Saturday, went
camping with my daughter.

383
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,652
And, uh, Sunday, did a big Costco run.

384
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:07,822
There's, like, 300
hot dogs in my freezer.

385
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:10,524
Oh, really? That is so interest...

386
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:12,693
Oh, dear. Look what you
did to poor Giancarlo.

387
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:14,462
Dead from boredom.

388
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:16,430
Now, look, you're going
to this Top Meet mixer

389
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:17,509
to hunt down a killer,

390
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:19,433
not to talk about your
hunt for bulk food bargains.

391
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:20,525
Okay.

392
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:23,689
Sorry I'm not fancy-schmancy
enough for Giancarlo.

393
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:25,272
Okay, let's get the
terminology straight.

394
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:26,440
Not "fancy-schmancy."

395
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:27,650
Sophisticated.

396
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:28,943
Oh, whatever.

397
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:31,145
Why don't you just give me some tips

398
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:32,971
on how to blend in
with that crowd. Okay?

399
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:35,037
You think being as fascinating as I am

400
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,321
can be boiled down to a few tips?

401
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:39,586
This is not paint by numbers.

402
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:41,267
Goodness me, I need a drink.

403
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:44,225
Oh. Thank you.

404
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:46,881
- I have a tip, Mom. Don't talk about me.
- Mm. Mm!

405
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:49,603
Yes, definitely, no
mention of the child.

406
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:50,478
Ugh.

407
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:51,798
And enough with the tips.

408
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,600
Why don't we do a
little role-play, hmm?

409
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:55,770
- Okay.
- You be a randy single man,

410
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:56,904
I'll be...

411
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:58,650
I'll be the new you.

412
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:00,974
Okay, I've never once done that.

413
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:02,509
My point exactly.

414
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:04,745
Meet Lucinda. Come on.

415
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,962
Gosh, this is gonna be
harder than I thought.

416
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,132
Oh, crap.

417
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:44,552
Oh.

418
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:47,188
Need some help there, sir?

419
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,722
There you go.

420
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:57,364
Good news, Ella.

421
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:59,967
I've been admitted to the
Forensic Shadow Program.

422
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,251
What is that?

423
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:02,470
A mentorship program.

424
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:04,371
Which means I will be your student.

425
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:06,507
I am going to stick to you like glue,

426
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:09,577
so I can learn how to
be good... at forensics.

427
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:11,378
Stuff comes up constantly in court.

428
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,814
- That's great.
- Hold it, please!

429
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,341
Oh, I don't think so, buddy.

430
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,611
I mean, what am I, Mother Teresa?

431
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:34,632
My, my.

432
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:36,034
Detective.

433
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,404
You look...

434
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:39,173
Like a female Lucifer?

435
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,674
Well, that's what I was going for.

436
00:16:40,676 --> 00:16:41,876
Well,

437
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:44,645
close enough, but you're
going to need this.

438
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,741
Do I really need to wear an ear bug?

439
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:48,809
Absolutely.

440
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,125
From what we know about our killer,

441
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:51,860
blue-eyed sushi snob who loves surfing

442
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:54,164
and splooshing, I'd say you're
a bit out of your comfort zone,

443
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,734
so you're going to need
to bring Lucinda's A game.

444
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:57,969
You mean your A game.

445
00:16:57,972 --> 00:16:59,439
Absolutely. Oh, and while we're at it,

446
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:01,309
do you need a refresher on
"splooshing"? It's very simple.

447
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,264
- You just cover yourself in...
- No, no. Stop. I'm good, I'm good.

448
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:04,661
But... oh.

449
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:06,689
Except for...

450
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,102
What, you don't want to wear it?

451
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:09,236
It's not...

452
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,838
really Lucinda's style.

453
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,942
Right.

454
00:17:11,945 --> 00:17:13,090
Oh.

455
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,471
Okay.

456
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:20,740
There.

457
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:21,908
I'm ready.

458
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,676
Yes, you are.

459
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,211
Good luck.

460
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:27,080
Thank you.

461
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:47,100
Hi. I'll get a, uh, IPA, please.

462
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,434
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

463
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:50,536
Not beer. Prosecco.

464
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,105
But I hate Prosecco.

465
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:54,939
Well, tough luck. Lucinda loves it.

466
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:56,341
Beer.

467
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:57,989
It's a good job I'm here.

468
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:59,747
Yeah, man. Close call.

469
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:07,848
Possible suspect, moving in.

470
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:09,689
Right. Whatever he says to you,

471
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:10,823
just laugh.

472
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,892
Hey there.

473
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:14,794
What's your name?

474
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:17,864
Lucinda.

475
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,332
No, no...

476
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,668
Not like a demented witch on crack.

477
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,670
A deep, sultry laugh.

478
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:28,441
Ha, ha, ha.

479
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:29,642
Ha... I'm sorry.

480
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:32,645
I think I may have had a
little too much Prosecco

481
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:34,514
on an empty stomach.

482
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:35,581
I should have had that sushi.

483
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,283
Did you try the sushi? Is it good?

484
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:39,819
No, no. I didn't. I'm a, I'm a vegan.

485
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:40,831
Oh.

486
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:42,267
Anyway.

487
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,490
You might want to go
easy on the bubbles.

488
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:46,959
Ah.

489
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,328
Smooth.

490
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:50,970
Beginner's bad luck.

491
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:52,706
Look, it's hard to do justice

492
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:54,923
to my captivating essence,
but she'll get the hang of it.

493
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,113
Don't be such a Debbie Downer, Daniel.

494
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,105
Sorry.

495
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:08,347
- Hey.
- Hey.

496
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:09,949
Hi.

497
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,150
You're really tan.

498
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:12,785
Are you, uh, are you a surfer?

499
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:15,088
Well, I'd sure like
to surf in your eyes.

500
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,489
Ugh, dearie me.

501
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:18,991
He's lucky it's not a
crime to be a cheeseball.

502
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,727
Anyway, at least the ice is broken.

503
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:22,703
Now, just make small talk.

504
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,563
So I drove up to this meditation retreat

505
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,866
in Big Sur last week.

506
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,000
No, no, no!

507
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:29,068
PCH is closed.

508
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,236
Say you helicoptered...

509
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:31,070
Shush.

510
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,772
Uh, excuse me?

511
00:19:32,774 --> 00:19:34,941
Sploosh. I said "sploosh."

512
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:36,809
Are you into splooshing?

513
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:57,663
Time to change tactics.

514
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:59,232
You know what?

515
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,935
Enjoy the Prosecco, Lucinda.

516
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,006
I don't believe this.

517
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:09,036
Ditching protocol mid-sting?

518
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,305
Who does that?

519
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,311
Maybe she'll do better on her own.

520
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:13,579
Don't be ridiculous, Daniel.

521
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,548
She'll flounder without
my expert guidance.

522
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,749
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

523
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:18,417
I'm clearly needed on the front lines.

524
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,894
You just stay here and
do what you do best.

525
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,256
Nada.

526
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,462
Oh, I love traveling.

527
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:30,696
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

528
00:20:30,698 --> 00:20:31,898
Any fun plans coming up?

529
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,534
Um, well, I...

530
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:37,236
I was thinking of, uh,
maybe getting out of the city

531
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:39,798
and taking my daughter camping.

532
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:40,961
Cool.

533
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:42,408
I-I love the outdoors.

534
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,767
- Oh.
- I'm a surfer.

535
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,231
Really?

536
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:46,746
Goes well with camping.

537
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:48,614
I've always wanted to try surfing.

538
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:49,749
- But I...
- You should...

539
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:51,884
Oh, hi, Lucifer.

540
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,119
This is Benji.

541
00:20:53,122 --> 00:20:54,587
He just had

542
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,022
four pieces of sashimi,

543
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:57,657
and we just started
talking about surfing.

544
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:59,610
Oh, lovely. Now, I insist

545
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:01,168
you put your mic back in immediately.

546
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:02,876
We can't hear a thing in the truck.

547
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:04,579
You are being quite loud.

548
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:06,094
Nice work.

549
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,701
Bloody hell.

550
00:21:08,704 --> 00:21:10,227
Hey, there goes Benji!

551
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,763
Benji, over here!

552
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:14,390
Whoa. You have to save me from them.

553
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:15,641
Uh, yeah.

554
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:17,910
They're with me.

555
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,378
Not bad for nada, huh?

556
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:21,681
Wait, she's a cop?

557
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:23,082
Detective Decker, LAPD.

558
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:24,784
We want to talk to you about a murder.

559
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:26,485
Benji, you're the best, bro!

560
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:27,687
You're not paparazzi?

561
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:29,288
What?

562
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,531
Oh, thank God.

563
00:21:30,534 --> 00:21:33,784
I mean, the things Dad gets credit for.

564
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:39,211
Yeah, I went on a date with her.

565
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:41,714
Just the other night.

566
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:44,775
Still can't believe
she's, uh... she's dead.

567
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,051
Oh?

568
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:48,387
Did you think she'd
survive you murdering her?

569
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:50,289
I told you, I'm innocent.

570
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,624
Well, you're an overpaid DJ,

571
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,392
so that's up for debate.

572
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:56,095
It seems you were the last
person to see Kim alive.

573
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:57,630
I couldn't have been.

574
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,198
When I dropped her off after our date,

575
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,400
- her roommate was still there.
- How do you know that?

576
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:03,102
Because that's the reason
I didn't go upstairs

577
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:04,737
like Kim suggested.

578
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,005
I was trying to avoid Esther.

579
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:07,573
What, kombucha martini girl?

580
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:09,408
Do you know her roommate?

581
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,310
To the extent that you can know someone

582
00:22:11,312 --> 00:22:13,245
who's glued to her phone
and talks in hashtags.

583
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:14,613
Yep, that's her.

584
00:22:14,615 --> 00:22:16,048
How did you two meet?

585
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,129
We matched on the Top
Meet app a few weeks ago.

586
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:20,598
Went on two exhausting dates.

587
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:22,535
Then why go on the second date?

588
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,357
Because I wanted to see Kim again.

589
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,027
I met her at the apartment
when I picked up Esther

590
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:29,695
for our first date.

591
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:31,825
She wasn't there the second time.

592
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,828
So you can imagine how stoked I was

593
00:22:33,831 --> 00:22:35,399
when she popped up on the Top Meet app.

594
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:37,028
No. I can't, actually.

595
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:40,004
You're saying that you used
a top hat to get to a shoe?

596
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:41,707
He must be lying, Detective.

597
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:43,008
I'm not lying.

598
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,267
I really liked Kim.

599
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,846
She was different than all
the other women on the app.

600
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:49,181
What, different as in duller,

601
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:51,033
more mundane and dressed for less?

602
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,185
No, as in she didn't make me feel

603
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:55,688
like I had to be on all the time.

604
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,739
With her, I could...

605
00:22:58,742 --> 00:23:00,475
I could just be myself.

606
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:02,961
Interesting.

607
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:05,773
Thanks.

608
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:11,270
What if Esther found
out about Benji and Kim?

609
00:23:11,272 --> 00:23:12,981
Got jealous, lost control...

610
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:18,110
This goddess, jealous of the plain Jane?

611
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:19,317
It's-it's ludicrous!

612
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,844
It's like me being
jealous of that paper clip.

613
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:22,939
Or Daniel.

614
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:24,917
I mean, not to mention

615
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:27,700
Esther is far too busy
for murder, Detective.

616
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:29,551
Look. She flew to Florence last week

617
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:31,190
just 'cause she fancied
eating some gelato.

618
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:32,858
She went on a plane to get ice cream?

619
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,094
Well, when you say it in
English, it sounds silly.

620
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:37,863
Oh. Hello. Look at that belfie.

621
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:40,566
Bet you could bounce a
quarter off that derriÃ¨re.

622
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:43,635
Oh. Yeah...

623
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:46,338
Wait, uh, go back.

624
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,392
- There.
- What?

625
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:50,340
Something small and compact

626
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:52,180
and surprisingly heavy for its size.

627
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:53,916
Well, what's Miss Lopez's Aunt Rosalita

628
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,285
got to do with anything?

629
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,249
Look.

630
00:23:57,251 --> 00:23:58,434
The dumbbell.

631
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,885
It wasn't at the crime scene.

632
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:01,854
It matches the bruises on the victim,

633
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,055
it's a weapon of convenience,

634
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:04,890
and it fits the crime
of passion scenario.

635
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:07,526
Doesn't mean Esther was
the one to wield it, though.

636
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:09,595
If my theory of jealousy
is right, she was.

637
00:24:09,597 --> 00:24:11,012
Trust me, Detective,

638
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:13,382
there's no way that Esther
has ever used a weight...

639
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,832
I refer once again to her
naturally sublime derriÃ¨re.

640
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:27,312
Oh, crap.

641
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:43,462
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

642
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:45,364
Don't be crazy.

643
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:47,266
No. I just...

644
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:51,046
you know, like my floors spotless.

645
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,150
An evidence lab can never be too clean.

646
00:24:54,153 --> 00:24:58,410
And that is your Forensic
Lesson of the Day.

647
00:24:58,412 --> 00:24:59,611
More next week?

648
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:01,853
Why don't you want to mentor me?

649
00:25:01,856 --> 00:25:04,090
It's not that I don't want to, okay?

650
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:05,451
I just don't have the time.

651
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:06,819
Well, I've been watching you.

652
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:07,853
You have plenty of time.

653
00:25:07,855 --> 00:25:09,588
You just waste it chitchatting.

654
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,595
You mean socializing?

655
00:25:11,598 --> 00:25:14,681
Connecting with people isn't a waste.

656
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:16,161
Okay.

657
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:19,264
Let's be honest here.

658
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:23,235
You don't really care about
anyone's kids or whatever.

659
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:25,370
I mean, you're faking it, right?

660
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:28,373
Just tell me, how do you keep
your eyes from glazing over?

661
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:32,177
There is no Forensic
Shadow Program, is there?

662
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:37,353
Even if I had been tempted to help...

663
00:25:37,356 --> 00:25:39,718
And I'm not saying that I had...

664
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,353
Now that I know you lied?

665
00:25:41,355 --> 00:25:43,222
Poof!

666
00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:46,059
Temptation officially gone.

667
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:05,944
Okay, so I'm thinking:
big band over here

668
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:09,548
and two long, two long
buffet tables over here...

669
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,983
or should we do three?

670
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:12,784
Well, it depends. How
many people are coming?

671
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:14,219
Uh, just 350.

672
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:16,555
350?

673
00:26:16,557 --> 00:26:18,023
Wow.

674
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,554
I didn't realize how much
you still cared about Reese.

675
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:21,556
Of course I do!

676
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,028
I'm heartbroken about his death.

677
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,830
Distraught, really.

678
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:26,265
Can barely function.

679
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,735
Okay, okay.

680
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:33,305
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
I'm functioning perfectly.

681
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:34,540
I only feel terrible

682
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,475
that I don't feel
terrible about his death.

683
00:26:36,477 --> 00:26:38,644
Okay, so all of this is just a...

684
00:26:38,646 --> 00:26:40,445
A pathetic attempt to cover up the fact

685
00:26:40,447 --> 00:26:45,050
that I can't stop thinking about me.

686
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:47,452
Me, me.

687
00:26:47,454 --> 00:26:49,488
Me and my own brush with death.

688
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,657
- I understand, Linda. I mean...
- How could you possibly understand

689
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,426
what it's like to be rotisseried

690
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,792
by the, by the goddess of all creation?

691
00:26:57,998 --> 00:27:00,299
Dealing with mortality
was so much easier

692
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:03,135
when I was just another clueless idiot.

693
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:09,074
Being a celestial
insider... really sucks.

694
00:27:09,076 --> 00:27:11,009
I used to walk around thinking

695
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:14,279
maybe reincarnation was real.

696
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:16,798
Sure, it sounded bonkers,

697
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,418
but I could still wonder, still hope.

698
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:25,757
What if I came back as
a chameleon or something?

699
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:28,994
Chameleons are cool.

700
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,283
But now I know that's never happening,

701
00:27:33,286 --> 00:27:37,169
because I know, you know, everything,

702
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:40,606
including where I'm headed
when... when this is over.

703
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:42,279
And where is that?

704
00:27:42,282 --> 00:27:43,615
Where do you think?

705
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:47,846
I wish I'd never met any of you.

706
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:57,164
So we wanted to, uh, ask you

707
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,123
a few...

708
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:00,093
Would you want to put on a shirt,

709
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:03,337
or anything to cover... your body?

710
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,141
No. Why? Are you cold?

711
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,675
Yes. Would you like
my jacket, Detective?

712
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:09,160
No. I am great, thank you.

713
00:28:09,163 --> 00:28:10,345
Right.

714
00:28:10,347 --> 00:28:13,615
So, when was this photo taken?

715
00:28:13,617 --> 00:28:19,287
Uh, I took that on my
way to Tokyo, I think.

716
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:20,553
Sorry.

717
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:23,280
I travel so much, it's
hard to keep track.

718
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:25,359
It's actually something else

719
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:26,795
that we're trying to track down.

720
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:28,097
This pink dumbbell here?

721
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,597
It went missing the
night of Kim's murder.

722
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,765
Any idea where it went?

723
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:31,800
Nope.

724
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:33,935
It's not mine. I don't work out.

725
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:35,569
- Ah.
- Everything you see

726
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:37,538
- is God-given.
- And they say that

727
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,077
Dad doesn't give with both hands.

728
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,375
So, the dumbbell.

729
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:41,543
You're saying that's Kim's?

730
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:42,877
Yeah. Poor thing

731
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:44,879
tried so hard to be like me.

732
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,569
So how did it feel when you realized

733
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:48,202
that Benji preferred Kim to you?

734
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:50,083
Nuh, uh-uh-uh. Sneaky.

735
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:51,786
Don't listen to the detective, darling.

736
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:53,188
She's trying to trick you.

737
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,589
You just look into my eyes

738
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:57,125
so we can prove to her that she's wrong.

739
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:59,727
Now, you're too sophisticated

740
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:02,202
to care about your boring
flatmate's trifles, aren't you?

741
00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:05,332
Tell me, what is it
that you really desire?

742
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:07,635
I...

743
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:09,925
I...

744
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:11,039
Yeah.

745
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,074
Want to...

746
00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:16,044
stop posing and lying!

747
00:29:16,678 --> 00:29:18,379
It takes so much effort

748
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,498
to make these pics look so effortless.

749
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:21,800
It's exhausting!

750
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,917
Well, so you're saying
it's just all a facade?

751
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,621
I don't even know what that word means!

752
00:29:26,623 --> 00:29:28,592
I'm not worldly at all!

753
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:34,233
#Barbados?

754
00:29:34,236 --> 00:29:35,335
More like

755
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:37,065
#Bogus.

756
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,166
The most exotic place

757
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:40,001
I've ever been is the gym's sauna.

758
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:41,936
But you said you didn't work out.

759
00:29:41,938 --> 00:29:44,019
Of course I do.

760
00:29:44,022 --> 00:29:46,441
With real equipment, at a gym,

761
00:29:46,443 --> 00:29:47,909
not in my living room.

762
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,011
So you're still saying
that the dumbbell is Kim's?

763
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:54,182
Yeah. She tried everything to be
part of my glamorous lifestyle.

764
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:56,351
She was even planning on getting surgery

765
00:29:56,353 --> 00:29:57,685
once all the money came in.

766
00:29:57,687 --> 00:29:58,820
What money?

767
00:29:58,822 --> 00:29:59,988
I don't know,

768
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,123
but she made it sound life-changing.

769
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,359
Maybe the motive

770
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,994
for Kim's murder was financial.

771
00:30:05,996 --> 00:30:07,896
Maybe she was coming
into some inheritance,

772
00:30:07,898 --> 00:30:09,816
and someone wasn't happy about it.

773
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:11,799
I can't believe Esther was a fake.

774
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:13,835
I mean, how did I
completely misjudge her?

775
00:30:13,837 --> 00:30:14,936
Lucifer, are you listening?

776
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,604
We need to look into this windfall.

777
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,739
Detective, I think

778
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:19,607
I've been spending
too much time with you.

779
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,644
It's turned my top hat radar rusty.

780
00:30:21,647 --> 00:30:23,413
- What?
- But no offense, but I think I need

781
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,379
to go and hang out with
some interesting people

782
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:27,015
before you turn me into a shoe.

783
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:41,462
- I'm sorry.
- Mm.

784
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,264
I don't regret meeting you.

785
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:45,600
I just... It's a lot.

786
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:48,336
I've calmed down now, so can we go?

787
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:50,405
Lie down with me, Linda.

788
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:52,819
On the... on the sand?

789
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:55,843
Oh, okay.

790
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:02,417
Listen,

791
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:06,187
there was a time when I, too,
thought that I knew everything.

792
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:11,194
This was... this was
back when I was an angel

793
00:31:11,197 --> 00:31:15,363
and spent all my time
looking down on the world.

794
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,267
But, you see, I found

795
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:21,436
that it takes looking
up to gain perspective.

796
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:23,371
It's a good reminder of just how much

797
00:31:23,373 --> 00:31:25,540
there is that we don't know.

798
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,775
Linda...

799
00:31:27,777 --> 00:31:32,580
if you really think about it...

800
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:35,183
do you have any fewer
questions than you used to?

801
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,951
When you didn't know?

802
00:31:36,953 --> 00:31:39,954
I mean, they're... they're
different questions,

803
00:31:39,956 --> 00:31:41,823
but there are just as many, maybe more.

804
00:31:41,825 --> 00:31:43,024
So you're still every bit

805
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,050
the clueless idiot that you always were?

806
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:53,468
That helps.

807
00:31:55,572 --> 00:31:58,358
Still sucks about the chameleon, though.

808
00:32:08,184 --> 00:32:09,851
Thank you.

809
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:20,728
I can't find any sign of that windfall.

810
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,765
As far as I can tell, there
was no money coming Kim's way.

811
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,266
Oh, there's got to be something.

812
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:26,480
There is.

813
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:28,770
Charlotte, what are you doing here?

814
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:32,035
I felt unsettled about lying to you.

815
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:34,909
Um, I thought I could make up
for it by making myself useful.

816
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:39,013
So, I overheard you talking
about finding a connection

817
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:41,416
between the dead girl and
that exclusive dating app.

818
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,530
So I did a little
digging, and I found one...

819
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:45,687
- Well, we're long past that.
- Are you sure?

820
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:47,652
I had to pull some strings to get this.

821
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:49,524
It's an employment contract

822
00:32:49,526 --> 00:32:51,559
between Kim and the owner of the app,

823
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:52,794
Mack something.

824
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:55,530
Drawn up two years ago in total secrecy.

825
00:32:55,532 --> 00:32:57,975
But Mack said that he hadn't met Kim

826
00:32:57,978 --> 00:32:59,511
until she called him that night.

827
00:32:59,514 --> 00:33:00,768
Oh, he met her, all right.

828
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,070
Kim hired him.

829
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:03,604
She hired him?

830
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,973
And then hacked his app?
It doesn't make sense.

831
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:07,141
Unless...

832
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:08,810
she didn't hack it.

833
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:12,513
Top Meet's encryption protocol
is impossible to crack.

834
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:14,415
Except to the person who built it.

835
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:15,516
Exactly.

836
00:33:15,518 --> 00:33:17,485
So, if Kim created Top Meet,

837
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:19,187
then who the hell is Mack?

838
00:33:19,189 --> 00:33:21,622
Well, no computer whiz, that's for sure.

839
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,857
C-minus student,

840
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:24,892
barely graduated high school.

841
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:27,328
Voted Most Likely to
Sleep His Way to the Top.

842
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,530
And guess what he was
doing before Top Meet.

843
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:30,965
Spin instructor.

844
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,934
Okay, wh-why would
Kim hire him, though,

845
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:35,172
if she's this genius computer engineer?

846
00:33:35,175 --> 00:33:36,941
What does he bring to the equation?

847
00:33:36,944 --> 00:33:38,699
Uh... that.

848
00:33:38,702 --> 00:33:40,808
Look at him and then look at her.

849
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,909
If both came to you

850
00:33:41,911 --> 00:33:43,845
asking for funding for
an elite dating app,

851
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,413
whose project would you invest in?

852
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:47,749
Well, yeah, if you're being
all superfish and whatevs.

853
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:49,238
Which many people are.

854
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:52,186
Maybe Kim felt she wasn't
fancy-schmancy enough,

855
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:54,620
so she hid the fact
that she was the creator,

856
00:33:54,623 --> 00:33:57,391
and hired pretty boy Mack
here to be the facade.

857
00:33:57,393 --> 00:34:00,161
In secret. Explains
why it didn't come up

858
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,248
- in the background check.
- So Kim's insecurities

859
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,731
allowed Mack to take the credit.

860
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:05,342
And the money.

861
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:07,434
Which she wanted to take back.

862
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:09,100
That's the windfall she was expecting.

863
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:10,571
It's a strong motive
for him to kill her.

864
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:12,874
- Yeah, but didn't his alibi check out?
- He could have

865
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,710
easily convinced one of his
employees to lie for him.

866
00:34:15,712 --> 00:34:17,812
It's a solid theory, but still,

867
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:20,148
it's just a theory... we need proof.

868
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,596
I really wish we had
that murderous dumbbell

869
00:34:21,598 --> 00:34:23,365
- right about now.
- Well, if Mack did it,

870
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:26,219
- I think we know where to find it. Hmm?
- We do?

871
00:34:26,222 --> 00:34:27,321
Uh, there's a good chance

872
00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:29,090
the murder weapon is at Mack's place.

873
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:31,459
Seasoned killers know
to leave it at the scene,

874
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,928
but first-timers, they
tend to take it with them.

875
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:37,376
I can't count the times I've
allegedly helped a client unmake

876
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,079
that mistake.

877
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:40,467
Really?

878
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,069
What? I said "allegedly."

879
00:34:43,406 --> 00:34:45,740
We need to get a search
warrant for Mack's place.

880
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:48,109
- Yeah, good luck with that.
- Excuse me?

881
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,411
Mack's lawyer will argue that
all you have is conjecture

882
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:51,779
based on circumstantial evidence,

883
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:53,264
and any judge will agree.

884
00:34:53,267 --> 00:34:55,082
You're never getting that warrant.

885
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:59,554
Well, then it's a good thing
I am exactly our killer's type.

886
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:04,158
Mack! I love the place.

887
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,393
Mr. Morningstar.

888
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,396
How about a gentlemen's
weekend in Vegas?

889
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,731
I need to scrape the rust off
my playboy ways, and you're

890
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,999
just the chap to help this Devil

891
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:13,534
get his groove back. What do you say?

892
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,336
That sounds fun.

893
00:35:15,338 --> 00:35:16,604
- Yeah.
- Uh...

894
00:35:16,606 --> 00:35:20,074
but I'm afraid I have
a previous engagement.

895
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,524
Oh?

896
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:32,831
Some alone time with the detective?

897
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:35,263
- Not alone anymore.
- Oh, Mack.

898
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,302
I suppose we all have our low points.

899
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,470
But not to worry,

900
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,405
I've got a chopper
waiting... If we leave now,

901
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,173
we can still make the Encore pool party.

902
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:44,309
I'm afraid you're gonna have to leave,

903
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:45,543
Detective... I'm trying to kick off

904
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:47,645
a Most Interesting
Bachelors' Bacchanalian here.

905
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,581
You leave. I'm having fun.

906
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,412
Something going on between you two?

907
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,312
- Absolutely not.
- Absolutely not.

908
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:54,953
I'm gonna grab a beer.

909
00:35:54,955 --> 00:35:57,789
Decide for yourselves who gets
the pleasure of my company.

910
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,791
Okay.

911
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:01,493
Well, I didn't have him
pegged for your type.

912
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:02,727
I thought you preferred them boring.

913
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:03,928
You think I'm on a date?

914
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,097
I am here looking for the
murder weapon, Lucifer.

915
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,999
What, so now you think
Mack's the killer?

916
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,768
You're just profiling
fabulous people, aren't you?

917
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,238
Enough with this crusade
against us already.

918
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,572
Mack isn't fabulous.

919
00:36:14,574 --> 00:36:16,140
Kim created Top Meet.

920
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:17,675
He stole it.

921
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:19,045
What?

922
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,581
- Another phony?
- Yes.

923
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:27,198
I suppose that explains the
self-aggrandizing artwork.

924
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:29,187
Would you just help me find the weapon?

925
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,622
Please?

926
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:33,937
Okay, fine, in my experience,
it's, uh, usually in the toilet.

927
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,206
Oh, I checked there.

928
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:36,961
Uh... freezer?

929
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:38,029
It's not there, either.

930
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,264
Well, the fireplace, then.

931
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:41,237
Oh, Lucifer.

932
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,634
There's no way.

933
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:45,036
I mean, could he really
be dumb enough to...

934
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,704
to...

935
00:36:47,812 --> 00:36:48,911
Lucifer.

936
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:49,980
Wha...

937
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:51,148
Ah.

938
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:53,352
Well, I think you put
the dumb into dumbbell.

939
00:36:53,355 --> 00:36:55,280
Decided against the beer...

940
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:56,848
Because A: carbs. And B:

941
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,384
two cops showing up at
my house on the same day.

942
00:36:59,393 --> 00:37:02,794
Uh, figured that must
not be a coincidence.

943
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:05,290
Still think I'm dumb?

944
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,292
Basic deduction doesn't
make you a genius, Mack.

945
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:09,093
But then again, you're used to taking

946
00:37:09,095 --> 00:37:10,461
more credit than you deserve.

947
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:13,431
Yes, Mack... Or should I say... Hack?

948
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:16,868
Waste of a pun. You're
gonna have to spell it out

949
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,835
for him, Detective.

950
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:20,405
We know that Kim created Top Meet.

951
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,274
Oh, yeah? You know she was
also gonna destroy it, too?

952
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:25,710
She sneaks onto the site,
goes on one good date,

953
00:37:25,712 --> 00:37:27,879
and then wants to make
the app more accessible.

954
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:29,447
So stupid!

955
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,625
What's stupid about
thinking someone deserves

956
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:33,711
to be loved for who they really are?

957
00:37:33,714 --> 00:37:35,520
Kim was the brains, Mack.

958
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:37,288
You were just the face.

959
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,883
Just the face?

960
00:37:38,886 --> 00:37:41,703
Kim was Wozniak. I'm Jobs.

961
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:43,728
No one gives a crap about Wozniak.

962
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:47,164
Oh, please, Mack. What
you are is a fraud.

963
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,267
Which, unfortunately, makes you boring.

964
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,235
And predictable. Watch.

965
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:55,034
- Put that down.
- Or what?

966
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:57,108
You're gonna blow your own
face to smithereens, Mack?

967
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,910
It's quite heavy, isn't it? At least

968
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,188
they got the density right.

969
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:01,012
Ooh!

970
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:02,472
Heads up!

971
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,214
Nice catch.

972
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:18,162
Today interesting enough for you?

973
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:20,098
Well, beats Monopoly.

974
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:26,704
But in the end,

975
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:28,439
the shoe turned out to be interesting,

976
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:30,541
and the top hat, boring.

977
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:35,079
Right. So you're gonna
embrace your boring side now?

978
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:36,938
Well, I would, but I
have no boring side.

979
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,384
Even the most trivial
of nights takes a turn

980
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:41,119
for the exciting when I'm involved.

981
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:43,254
I just got to throw a
man's own head at him.

982
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:46,691
That sounds... painful.

983
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:48,860
Oh, don't worry, he deserved it...

984
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:51,129
For pretending to be
something he wasn't.

985
00:38:51,131 --> 00:38:53,798
I mean, people really do
waste an awful lot of time

986
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,434
trying to be interesting.

987
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:57,602
People.

988
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:58,870
Not you, though.

989
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:01,005
Oh, no. To me, it just
comes effortlessly.

990
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:03,800
All I have to do is just be myself.

991
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:04,878
Hmm.

992
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:06,310
Mm.

993
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:08,893
But what I really want to know is,

994
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:10,729
how have you been doing?

995
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:15,687
Well...

996
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,223
I was in a really dark place.

997
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:21,059
But...

998
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:24,962
someone helped me gain perspective.

999
00:39:24,964 --> 00:39:28,266
How's that saying go?

1000
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:30,168
We're all in the gutter,

1001
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,670
but some of us are
looking up at the stars.

1002
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:33,871
The stars are just gas bags,

1003
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,773
and I never would have
fed Oscar that line

1004
00:39:35,775 --> 00:39:38,876
had I known how much I'd have to
hear people quote it back to me.

1005
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,445
Oscar freakin' Wilde?

1006
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:42,146
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?

1007
00:39:42,148 --> 00:39:44,348
Now, he was an interesting bachelor.

1008
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:48,119
Anyway, I'm glad to hear
that you are doing better.

1009
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:49,787
This calls for a celebration.

1010
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:52,592
So...

1011
00:39:52,595 --> 00:39:54,992
Oscar, huh?

1012
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:56,060
Mm.

1013
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:58,196
- Tell me everything.
- Well...

1014
00:39:58,198 --> 00:40:00,965
he was straight when I first met him.

1015
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,770
Oh, God!

1016
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,706
That one was all you.

1017
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,174
I was about to knock.

1018
00:40:12,045 --> 00:40:15,279
There's... something I need to tell you.

1019
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:17,081
Funny.

1020
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,384
There's actually something
I need to tell you, too.

1021
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:23,321
Thank you.

1022
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:26,491
That contract helped
put a killer behind bars.

1023
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:28,092
You did a good thing.

1024
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:29,594
I stole it.

1025
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:30,862
Aw, man.

1026
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:32,530
Seriously?

1027
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,032
You know what?

1028
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:36,601
It still counts, okay?

1029
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:38,936
You did a bad thing.

1030
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:42,373
But it was for a good reason.

1031
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:43,741
- Really?
- Yes.

1032
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:45,957
But only if, in good faith,

1033
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,079
you try to do it the right way first.

1034
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:50,414
Being good takes practice.

1035
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:52,911
Okay? So just keep at it,

1036
00:40:52,914 --> 00:40:55,019
and you'll get better.

1037
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:58,556
I guess I should take that job, then.

1038
00:40:58,558 --> 00:41:00,424
What job?

1039
00:41:00,426 --> 00:41:04,395
I've been offered a position
in the D.A.'s office to...

1040
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:07,165
help put criminals away for a change.

1041
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:09,567
Yeah, but like you would
ever take that pay cut.

1042
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:11,669
Yeah, I know.

1043
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:12,937
But anyway,

1044
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:15,373
um, sometimes there's
more important things...

1045
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:16,908
than money.

1046
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,778
Oh, yeah. Yeah, like all
the things money can buy.

1047
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,681
Too late... You talked me into it.

1048
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:24,949
I did?

1049
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:28,586
Yes. This job is the perfect place...

1050
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:31,444
to practice this "being good" thing.

1051
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,780
And bonus.

1052
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,526
I'll be around here more.

1053
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:40,298
Yeah.

1054
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,200
Bonus.

1055
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:47,638
So, how did Lucinda do, Mom?

1056
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,007
Uh, she did... okay.

1057
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:52,777
Helped us catch the bad guy in the end.

1058
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:54,879
- Thank you.
- No, I meant...

1059
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:57,181
how did meeting new
people at the party go?

1060
00:41:57,183 --> 00:41:59,417
Oh.

1061
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:00,985
Well, um...

1062
00:42:00,987 --> 00:42:04,655
I actually... had a pretty good time.

1063
00:42:04,657 --> 00:42:08,161
I mean, but only once
I... stopped being Lucinda

1064
00:42:08,164 --> 00:42:10,228
and started being myself.

1065
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:16,267
You know, it can be
scary sometimes, but...

1066
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:20,004
being who you really
are is never a bad idea.

1067
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:22,406
Hey, there's a piece missing.

1068
00:42:35,688 --> 00:42:37,655
Lucifer.

1069
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:40,391
Are you coming?

1070
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:41,492
Uh...

1071
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:44,208
how about a nice round of Monopoly?

1072
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:45,477
Yeah?
