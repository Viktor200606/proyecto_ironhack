00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,111
<i>Return it with so much as a scratch</i>
<i>and I'll see you in hell.</i>

166
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,447
<i>Couldn't you have just</i>
<i>brought the Corvette?</i>

167
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,699
<i>Please, detective,</i>
<i>Corvettes are a dime a dozen.</i>

168
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,285
<i>Besides, I want this case to be special.</i>

169
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,623
<i>[Chloe] Well, it's pretty straightforward.</i>

170
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,918
<i>We couldn't trace the threatening text</i>
<i>sent to our victim.</i>

171
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,296
{\an8}<i>But if the killer murdered Derek</i>
<i>just to win the auction, well...</i>

172
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,839
<i>[Lucifer sniffs]</i>

173
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,798
<i>What?</i>

174
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,134
{\an8}<i>No, don't let me put you off. I'm just...</i>

175
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,721
{\an8}<i>stopping to smell the detective</i>
<i>droning on about the case</i>

176
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,973
{\an8}<i>in total command</i>
<i>of all the boring details.</i>

177
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,226
{\an8}<i>It is very nostalgic.</i>

178
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,522
{\an8}<i>Okay. So the car that Derek won</i>
<i>was a Tucker 48.</i>

179
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,025
<i>If we find the car, then whoever it's</i>
<i>being handed off to may be our killer.</i>

180
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,068
<i>Found it!</i>

181
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,199
{\an8}<i>And I suppose that poor pencil-necked soul</i>
<i>is our killer.</i>

182
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,827
{\an8}<i>Excuse me! Excuse me.</i>
<i>Sorry, coming through.</i>

183
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,580
<i>Coming through. Ooh, lovely shirt. Joking.</i>

184
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,666
<i>That man is wanted by the police.</i>

<i>-[camera clicks]</i>
<i>-[Lucifer laughs]</i>

186
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,213
{\an8}<i>Well, we can't miss the part of the case</i>
<i>where we chase the suspect.</i>

187
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,881
{\an8}<i>Or you chase and I watch, I mean.</i>

188
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,550
<i>Or you could help this time.</i>

189
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,385
<i>Guys, please. Please, please.</i>

<i>-[ding]</i>
<i>-[gasps]</i>

194
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,271
<i>[Lucifer] See? Didn't have to chase him</i>
<i>at all. He got tired.</i>

195
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,564
<i>[sighs]</i>

196
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,691
{\an8}<i>Come on,</i>
<i>I thought that was one of my better puns.</i>

197
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,484
{\an8}<i>More than worthy of our final case.</i>

198
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,402
{\an8}<i>Wait, what?</i>

199
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,195
{\an8}<i>Well, I'm just trying to appreciate</i>

200
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,573
{\an8}<i>every moment of the last time</i>
<i>we're working together.</i>

201
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,701
{\an8}<i>One final case</i>
<i>to get closure on the whole thing.</i>

202
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,745
{\an8}<i>Okay. Can we talk about this another time?</i>

203
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,333
{\an8}<i>You have to listen to me. I hated Derek,</i>
<i>but I would never kill anyone, I swear.</i>

204
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,378
<i>Detective, please.</i>
<i>One last time for posterity.</i>

205
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,213
<i>Go ahead.</i>

206
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,757
{\an8}<i>Kev, tell me...</i>

207
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,343
{\an8}<i>what is it that you truly desire?</i>

208
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,220
<i>Power? Wealth?</i>

209
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,055
<i>Better dress sense?</i>

210
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,557
<i>I...</i>

211
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,397
<i>To tell the truth</i>
<i>so I don't go to jail for murder.</i>

212
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,693
<i>[Chloe] What? If that's the case,</i>
<i>then why did you run?</i>

213
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,737
<i>'Cause I thought you were here</i>
<i>about the kit cars.</i>

214
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,073
{\an8}<i>Kit cars? You mean those awful replicas</i>
<i>that only look vintage?</i>

215
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,950
<i>Those don't fool anybody with taste.</i>

216
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,910
<i>[man] True, but you can make</i>
<i>a ton of money selling them</i>

217
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,787
<i>to goobers who can't tell the difference.</i>

218
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,997
<i>It's not like it's illegal.</i>

219
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,998
<i>Sounds illegal.</i>

220
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,959
<i>It is illegal, but it's not murder.</i>

221
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,169
{\an8}<i>Listen, we saw the messages.</i>

222
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,631
{\an8}<i>You said that you wanted to kill him</i>
<i>before he could collect on this auction.</i>

223
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,424
{\an8}<i>Kill his reputation.</i>

224
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,052
{\an8}<i>I was going to tell everyone</i>
<i>I sold him a couple of kits.</i>

225
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,220
{\an8}<i>Your rep is all you have in our world.</i>

226
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,307
{\an8}<i>Yes, what a tragedy</i>
<i>to lose the respect of these...</i>

227
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,225
{\an8}<i>people.</i>

228
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,894
<i>[man] Look, he was killed</i>
<i>this morning, right?</i>

229
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,980
{\an8}<i>I was selling a kit Porsche 550</i>
<i>to a guy up in Fresno.</i>

230
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,732
<i>I just flew back two hours ago.</i>

231
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,941
<i>[Chloe] Alright, we'll check that out.</i>

232
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,235
<i>But unless you have</i>
<i>any other information, then...</i>

233
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,030
{\an8}<i>Wait. You should check out this guy</i>
<i>Derek's been hanging out with.</i>

234
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,199
{\an8}<i>Scary dude, shaved head.</i>

235
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,575
<i>Tattoos.</i>

236
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,994
<i>Do you have the scary dude's name?</i>

237
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,372
<i>I never saw him myself.</i>

238
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,666
<i>Er... but I saw his car.</i>

239
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:11,087
<i>He has an awful '92 Geo Metro</i>
<i>in Polynesian green.</i>

240
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,046
<i>Oh.</i>

241
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,005
<i>Ow! Oh, okay.</i>

242
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,925
<i>[phone buzzes]</i>

243
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,593
{\an8}<i>Oh! Ah...</i>

244
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,680
{\an8}<i>The girl from the jewelry auction.</i>

245
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,932
<i>You're still hanging out with her?</i>

246
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:23,849
<i>Yes.</i>

247
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,726
<i>Yes, she's been staying with me.</i>

248
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,269
<i>-Hmm.</i>
<i>-[Lucifer] She's...</i>

249
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,771
<i>Never mind.</i>

250
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,191
{\an8}<i>So why don't we go and catch</i>
<i>this scary dude?</i>

251
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,193
<i>He sounds like a worthy final killer.</i>

252
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,404
<i>Okay.</i>

253
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,746
{\an8}<i>Lucy, are you here?</i>

254
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,832
<i>Listen, we...</i>

255
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,584
<i>got your baby gift, but...</i>

256
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,921
<i>Yeah, I don't think</i>
<i>these are teething rings.</i>

257
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,464
<i>Amenadiel?</i>

258
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,842
<i>Hey.</i>

259
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,260
<i>Your brother's out.</i>

260
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,761
<i>Eve.</i>

261
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,556
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

262
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,974
<i>Did you hurt Lucifer?</i>

263
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,602
<i>Only when he asked me nicely.</i>

264
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,271
{\an8}<i>[giggles] Why?</i>

265
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,690
{\an8}<i>Because he killed Cain, Eve.</i>

266
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:13,691
{\an8}<i>Your son.</i>

267
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,573
{\an8}<i>You know, I met Charlotte Richards</i>
<i>on my way out of heaven.</i>

268
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,076
<i>She was lovely.</i>

269
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,415
<i>Same as my sweet and...</i>

270
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,375
<i>gentle Abel.</i>

271
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,046
<i>Pretty sure he heard</i>
<i>what was coming to him.</i>

272
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,882
<i>Then why would you leave the Silver City?</i>

273
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,050
<i>Look who's talking.</i>

274
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,554
<i>You're the one who couldn't wait</i>
<i>to tell everybody up there</i>

275
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,557
<i>how all of God's children</i>
<i>create their own fate.</i>

276
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,894
<i>How we decide where we belong.</i>

277
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,813
{\an8}<i>[scoffs] That was different, Eve.</i>

278
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,149
{\an8}<i>I'm an angel. You're mortal.</i>

279
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,942
{\an8}<i>Yes, I'm mortal.</i>

280
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,111
{\an8}<i>Created directly by the hand of God.</i>

281
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,115
{\an8}<i>Hence me being able to slip right back</i>
<i>into my old bones.</i>

282
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,910
{\an8}<i>Yes, you were able to come back</i>
<i>down here to Earth, Eve,</i>

283
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,995
{\an8}<i>but did you not even consider...</i>

284
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,916
{\an8}<i>that, after rejecting heaven,</i>
<i>you may not be allowed back in?</i>

285
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,086
<i>Why would I want to go back</i>
<i>to that boring place?</i>

286
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,507
<i>I'm having the time of my life</i>
<i>down here with Lucifer.</i>

287
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,092
<i>And what happens</i>
<i>when that comes to an end?</i>

288
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,930
{\an8}<i>Well, if I get sent to hell, then...</i>

289
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,100
<i>me and Lucifer can keep the party going</i>
<i>down there.</i>

290
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,315
<i>[Lucifer] I've gotten to know all of you</i>

291
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,651
<i>in my time here,</i>
<i>which is what makes this...</i>

292
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,196
<i>my final case, so difficult.</i>

293
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,116
<i>Dougie in the motor pool,</i>
<i>who helped put a siren on my car.</i>

294
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,159
<i>Thank you for that.</i>

295
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:52,289
<i>Cucuzza in evidence, who always let me</i>
<i>inspect the cocaine seizures first.</i>

296
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,792
<i>[Lucifer chuckles]</i>

297
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,960
<i>And you.</i>

298
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,089
<i>Nameless uni,</i>
<i>I think I'll miss you most of all.</i>

299
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,343
<i>So anyway,</i>
<i>as a parting gift for everyone...</i>

300
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:11,183
<i>I've hired a Carl's Jr. truck out in</i>
<i>the parking lot. Free burgers for you all.</i>

301
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,310
<i>-[cheers]</i>
<i>-Go on! Knock yourselves out.</i>

302
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,729
<i>He's not really going to leave us, is he?</i>

303
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,608
<i>No. Remember when Lucifer disappeared</i>
<i>and he came back married?</i>

304
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,778
<i>I mean, this is how</i>
<i>he works through his issues.</i>

305
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,031
<i>Er... soon enough, everything will be </i>
<i>back to normal, I'm sure.</i>

306
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,366
<i>Yeah, you're totally right.</i>

307
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,202
<i>He's going to burn out</i>
<i>on all these new ladies soon enough.</i>

308
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,663
<i>-Actually, it's just the one lady.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

309
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,499
<i>Some party girl named Eve.</i>

310
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,167
<i>Wait, what?</i>

311
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,003
<i>Are you serious?</i>

312
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,297
<i>I mean, if you're serious, that's serious.</i>

313
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,341
<i>I'm not worried. I am not worried at all.</i>

314
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,969
<i>There is no way</i>
<i>she knows the real Lucifer like I do.</i>

315
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,888
<i>-Ladies.</i>
<i>-[Chloe] Hi.</i>

316
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,307
<i>Any news on our scary dude?</i>

317
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:56,896
<i>Mm. Yes, so these 16 individuals drive</i>
<i>Geo Metros in the Tri-County area.</i>

318
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,565
<i>Oh. Mike Tyson here, very scary looking.</i>

319
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,152
<i>[Chloe] Now what about this guy</i>
<i>in the jailhouse tats?</i>

320
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,695
<i>[Ella] That is Sid Kluge.</i>

321
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,740
<i>Well, I think you hit the jackpot, Decker.</i>

322
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,242
<i>Yeah, rap sheet full of B&amp;Es</i>
<i>and aggravated assaults.</i>

323
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,412
<i>And the address,</i>
<i>right off of Venice Boulevard,</i>

324
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,497
<i>near that dispensary that you love.</i>

325
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,250
<i>Oh, detective, you know me so well.</i>

326
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,585
<i>[Lucifer chuckles]</i>

327
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,921
<i>I really will miss this</i>
<i>once the case is over.</i>

328
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,051
<i>Over?</i>

329
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,094
<i>Oh. [mouths silently]</i>

330
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:31,931
<i>[Dan] Yo.</i>

331
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:32,890
<i>[Maze] Hey.</i>

332
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,101
<i>Is that Drill-bit Bueller?</i>

333
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,436
<i>Yep.</i>

334
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,023
<i>You know, he and his brother Sean are two</i>
<i>of the most feared guys in the streets.</i>

335
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,524
<i>Yeah, well, now they fear me.</i>

336
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,196
<i>Hey, I was going after his brother next</i>
<i>and I was thinking...</i>

337
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,740
<i>maybe you can jump in on the fun?</i>

338
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,158
<i>[chuckle]</i>

339
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:56,997
<i>Look, Maze, that whole thing with Los Xs,</i>
<i>that was just a means to an end.</i>

340
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,251
<i>I mean, it's not like I get my kicks</i>
<i>by beating the hell out of people.</i>

341
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,339
<i>Well, let me know</i>
<i>next time there's a means to an end...</i>

342
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,840
<i>Dan.</i>

343
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,764
<i>So I was thinking...</i>

344
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,558
<i>this doesn't have to be our last case.</i>

345
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,769
<i>Oh, no, no. This is for the best, I think.</i>

346
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,563
<i>There's no sense in dragging it out.</i>
<i>One last case should be enough.</i>

347
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,107
<i>Enough for what?</i>

348
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,775
<i>Well, for closure, of course.</i>

349
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,485
<i>What does that mean?</i>

350
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,406
<i>I... I'm not sure,</i>
<i>but the doctor told me I needed it.</i>

351
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,076
<i>Lucifer, if you ever need to talk</i>
<i>about anything--</i>

352
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,536
<i>I don't believe this.</i>

353
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,706
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-That geek was right about the car.</i>

354
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,083
<i>It's the most hideous thing</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

355
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,085
<i>Still, at least we know our killer's here.</i>

356
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,796
<i>[Chloe] Or not.</i>

357
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,715
<i>Hold on.</i>

358
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,811
<i>Well, it looks like this case might</i>
<i>drag out a little longer than I thought.</i>

359
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,483
<i>[Chloe] Huh.</i>

360
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,195
<i>No way it's a coincidence</i>

361
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,991
<i>that our number one suspect in</i>
<i>Derek's murder turns up dead hours later.</i>

362
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,659
<i>There has to be a connection.</i>

363
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,246
<i>I really had forgotten</i>
<i>how much fun this is.</i>

364
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,915
<i>You solving puzzles,</i>
<i>me trying to distract you...</i>

365
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,877
<i>-waiting to come up with the big insight--</i>
<i>-Found it!</i>

366
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,588
<i>-that breaks the case.</i>
<i>-Not only found it. I think...</i>

367
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,048
<i>-[smack]</i>
<i>-I solved it.</i>

368
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,883
<i>-[Chloe] What? </i>
<i>-There's Derek, Sid.</i>

369
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,092
<i>And recognize that third guy?</i>

370
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,595
<i>Yeah, one of the witnesses we talked to.</i>

371
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,431
<i>Yeah. Marco Franklin.</i>

372
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,309
<i>All three of them served in</i>
<i>the Explosives Ordnance division in Iraq.</i>

373
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,435
<i>But, wait, there's more.</i>

374
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,730
<i>Marco was just released from prison</i>
<i>two days ago</i>

375
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,815
<i>after serving a nine-year sentence</i>
<i>for bank robbery.</i>

376
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,694
<i>He bombed his way into the vault,</i>
<i>got caught coming out and, drum roll,</i>

377
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,947
<i>it is suspected he had two</i>
<i>other accomplices, never apprehended.</i>

378
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,201
<i>So Sid and Derek were his partners.</i>
<i>He gets caught, they don't.</i>

379
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,203
<i>Maybe they double-crossed him.</i>
<i>So now he's out--</i>

380
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,329
<i>Looking for closure.</i>

381
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,081
<i>Yeah. Call it whatever you want.</i>

382
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,333
<i>I call it solved!</i>

383
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,919
<i>[Chloe] That's a great theory,</i>
<i>but, right now, that's all it is.</i>

384
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,296
<i>We have no proof,</i>
<i>so the killer could be anyone.</i>

385
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,882
<i>Agreed. This doesn't really feel</i>
<i>like closure to me.</i>

386
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,675
<i>-It doesn't.</i>
<i>-[Lucifer] There must be more.</i>

387
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,803
<i>Witnesses saw a man</i>
<i>matching Marco's description</i>

388
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,888
<i>attacking Sid in front of his apartment.</i>

389
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,139
<i>-Circumstantial.</i>
<i>-Agreed.</i>

390
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,433
<i>Decker, you are putting me</i>
<i>through the wringer.</i>

391
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,685
<i>Respect. But I got you beat.</i>

392
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,396
<i>The striations on the shell casings</i>
<i>found at the scene</i>

393
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,981
<i>match Marco's 9mm.</i>

394
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,651
<i>I made sure</i>
<i>all the bases were covered for you.</i>

395
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,902
<i>Boom!</i>

396
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,114
<i>-We still have to pick him up.</i>
<i>-Yes, until the suspect's in custody</i>

397
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,907
<i>the case isn't truly closed, is it?</i>

398
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,034
<i>-Way ahead of you.</i>
<i>-Oh, for crying out loud.</i>

399
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,912
<i>Dan helped me with the records.</i>
<i>He's on his way to Marco's address now,</i>

400
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:42,830
<i>with some unis.</i>

401
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:46,083
<i>Nothing left for us to do now, folks,</i>
<i>but get our party on.</i>

402

<i>Yes, we have met.</i>

486
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,456
<i>She gave me drugs.</i>

487
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,749
<i>Really?</i>

488
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,459
<i>I need orange juice.</i>

489
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,128
<i>Oh, my God. Isn't she amazing?</i>

490
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,382
<i>I can see why Lucifer loves</i>

<i>Want my last Molly?</i>
<i>I was going to take it,</i>

<i>Who are you?</i>

495
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,224
<i>Oh, I'm Eve.</i>

496
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,226
<i>Okay, well, that doesn't help. Who...</i>

497
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,564
<i>Wait. Do you mean as in </i><span style="style2">Eve</i><i> Eve,</i>

<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

<i>He's going to be okay, right?</i>

542
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,213

<i>Marco, we know</i>

552

<i>I don't want to hurt you, detective.</i>

553
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,697
<i>I need your help.</i>

554

<i>When I went away, my wife changed her name</i>

00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,329
<i>-You did all this to find your wife?</i>
<i>-Look...</i>

557
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,833
<i>Shooting him was an accident, okay?</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it.</i>

558
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,836
<i>I'm just trying to...</i>
<i>just trying to fix things.</i>

559

<i>[Lucifer] Oh, don't worry about it, pal.</i>

560
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,633
<i>You just give me the gun</i>
<i>and I'll even things up.</i>

561
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,804
<i>[Marco] Look, when I went away to prison</i>
<i>for robbing that bank,</i>

562
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,846
<i>it ruined her.</i>

563
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,975
<i>You know, she disappeared,</i>
<i>and I understand.</i>

564
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,893
<i>But... but I...</i>

565
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:06,690
<i>I just want one chance to look her</i>
<i>in the eye and tell her that...</i>

566
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,985
<i>I just want to tell her that I'm sorry.</i>

567
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,112
<i>Okay.</i>

568
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,530
<i>I want you...</i>

569
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,490
<i>to find her now.</i>

570
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:16,908
<i>And then...</i>

571
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,411
<i>I will think about letting everyone go.</i>

572
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,788
<i>Okay.</i>

573
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,624
<i>Got it.</i>

574
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,793
<i>I'll take care of it, Chloe. You just...</i>

575
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,295
<i>You stay safe.</i>

576
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,301
<i>You guys don't go in unless I say so.</i>
<i>You got that?</i>

577
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,845
<i>Perimeters are being set up.</i>
<i>We'll sit tight for now.</i>

578
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,598
<i>Good. Our people are in there.</i>
<i>We're not going to take any risks.</i>

579
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,974
<i>Did you give the breach point?</i>

580
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,350
<i>No, the gunman was listening, but</i>

581
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,604
<i>he did ask for some food to be delivered,</i>
<i>so I think I have an idea.</i>

582
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,316
<i>-Got it?</i>
<i>-Got it.</i>

583
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,152
<i>I heard Lux is under siege.</i>

584
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,154
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Well, what are we waiting for?</i>

585
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,406
<i>You can't just go in there</i>
<i>swinging your knives around--</i>

586
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,325
<i>-That's exactly what I can do.</i>
<i>-You know what?</i>

587
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,577
<i>He has the entire place wired to blow.</i>
<i>It's too risky.</i>

588
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,997
<i>Fine. What's your plan?</i>

589
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,292
<i>I'm looking for Leona.</i>

590
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,377
<i>She's Marco's wife.</i>

591
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,172
<i>Apparently, she changed her name</i>
<i>a few years after he went inside,</i>

592
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,758
<i>but there are no records</i>
<i>of what she actually changed it to.</i>

593
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,842
<i>It's like she vanished.</i>

594
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,762
<i>No public records. </i>
<i>No social security number.</i>

595
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,305
<i>No social media footprint.</i>

596
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,723
<i>What is this? 2014?</i>

597
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,849
<i>Yeah, looks like it.</i>

598
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,145
<i>In 2014, there was only one guy</i>
<i>who wasn't in jail</i>

599
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,189
<i>who could help someone disappear</i>
<i>this cleanly.</i>

600
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,982
<i>-So who is he?</i>
<i>-I don't know his name.</i>

601
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,067
<i>But I can find out.</i>

602
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,319
<i>Okay, I'll put together a warrant</i>
<i>so we can trace it.</i>

603
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,112
<i>-You want to get a warrant?</i>
<i>-Well, yeah.</i>

604
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,490

607
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,788
<i>No! You have to think like them.</i>

608
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,999
<i>That is how I catch them,</i>
<i>and that is how we'll get this guy.</i>

00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,596
<i>Nonsense.</i>

612
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,517
<i>You needed my Aston to get in</i>
<i>and nobody drives it but me.</i>

613
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,353
<i>-I could have found another way. It's--</i>
<i>-No.</i>

614
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,230
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

615
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,981
<i>I needed closure.</i>

616
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,111

00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,665
<i>-We've got to get him to the hospital.</i>
<i>-No, I'm fine, Detective.</i>

620
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,709
<i>You just get me</i>
<i>within an inch of that dullard</i>

<i>Easy as pie. [laughs]</i>

00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,731
<i>Lucifer, you have a job too.</i>

651
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,566
<i>How do we sober up Ella?</i>

652
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,193
<i>Hold this.</i>

653
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,403
<i>I love you guys.</i>

654
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,489
<i>Not sober, but...</i>

<i>[groans]</i>

656
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,741

<i>[coughs]</i>

658
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,995
<i>It's the best way to lose your roll,</i>
<i>detective.</i>

659
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,371
<i>[coughs]</i>

660
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,172
<i>Shared office workspace.</i>

661
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,925
<i>Even I find this a bit cruel...</i>

662
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,885
<i>torture wise.</i>

663
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:10,350
<i>Still, great place to hide if you're</i>
<i>selling fake IDs on the dark web.</i>

664
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,313
<i>Erm, I'm... I don't know</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

665
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,107
<i>My partner wanted to come in here</i>
<i>and question you,</i>

666
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,985
<i>but I know someone like you</i>
<i>wouldn't just give it up.</i>

667
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,822
<i>So I suggested we torture you.</i>

668
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,323
<i>Just a little bit.</i>

669
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,243
<i>But he didn't like that idea.</i>

670
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,494
<i>And then...</i>

671
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,453
<i>Phew.</i>

672
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,372
<i>he said something kind of smart.</i>

673
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,166
<i>What's a criminal like you most afraid of?</i>

674
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,795
<i>Losing your anonymity.</i>

675
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,757
<i>So I get to torture you after all.</i>

676
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,761
<i>Expose you to all of these people,</i>
<i>show them...</i>

677
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,639

<i>I...</i>

681
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,648
<i>I just do fan subtitles for anime.</i>
<i>I don't make fake IDs.</i>

<i>What do you want?</i>

690
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,458
<i>I just help people disappear.</i>
<i>I didn't hurt anybody.</i>

691
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,710
<i>Yeah, yeah. We know.</i>

692
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,504
<i>And if you want to keep people</i>
<i>from being hurt...</i>

693
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:26,092
<i>you're going to tell us</i>
<i>everything you know about Leona Franklin.</i>

<i>[sighs]</i>
<i>The bleeding has slowed down a little.</i>

695
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,781
<i>I gave him another drink.</i>
<i>That seemed to help.</i>

696
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,745
<i>[sighs] Well, I've seen Lucifer</i>
<i>survive worse than this, so...</i>

697
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,955
<i>I'm sure he'll pull through.</i>

698
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,708
<i>He has to.</i>

699

<i>I can't lose him.</i>

<i>Not after we just found each other again.</i>

701
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,927
<i>So you've seen...</i>

702
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,470
<i>his devil face?</i>

703
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,472
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

704
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,307
<i>Does it scare you?</i>

705
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,517

00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,987
<i>I was literally created</i>

710
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,159
<i>No-one ever asked me</i>

<i>[Eve] The key is in a wireless trigger.</i>
<i>It's either Bluetooth or cellular.</i>

713

<i>Cellular would be a lot less complicated.</i>

714
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,846
<i>The relay's got no proximity handicap.</i>

715
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,556

716
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,226
<i>Really? How can you tell?</i>
<i>I don't feel any different.</i>

717

734
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,850
<i>What the hell does that even mean?</i>

735
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,184

<i>[Dan] Amy. Sorry.</i>

743

<i>Look, after everything you went through,</i>

00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,378
<i>I'm sure that this is probably</i>

<i>Ready to do it my way?</i>

749
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,853
<i>Look, I know this is a lot to ask of you.</i>

750

<i>And to be honest with you...</i>

753
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,369
<i>I don't think I can handle</i>

<i>Look, I'm trying...</i>

755

<i>so hard to do things the right way.</i>

756
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,091
<i>And maybe it's not right</i>
<i>for me to ask this of you...</i>

757
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,384
<i>but you can help them.</i>

758
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,347

<i>Argh, I ordered food over an hour ago.</i>

763
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,659
<i>Green onions and ranch dressing.</i>

764
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,164

<i>You'd better hope that your friends</i>

<i>than they are at taking food orders.</i>

767

<i>Are you sure?</i>

<i>No, no. Chloe's right.</i>

<i>I'm not going to make a mistake.</i>

<i>I can do that.</i>

778
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,946

<i>This is wrong, this is wrong.</i>

779
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,072
<i>Sandwich is wrong.</i>

780
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,740
<i>Maybe the sandwich isn't wrong.</i>

781
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,159
<i>Maybe there's a message in it.</i>

<i>This is the answer.</i>

794

<i>[Chloe] It's a southwestern sandwich</i>

<i>before that. Ella, are you good?</i>

814
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,410
<i>Yeah, sure. Yeah.</i>

815
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,998
<i>Eve, back her up in case anything happens.</i>
<i>You're... </i>

816
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,668
<i>good at... calming her down.</i>

817
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,794
<i>But what about--</i>

818
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,753
<i>He's going to be fine.</i>

819
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,922
<i>We just need a distraction</i>
<i>to get you guys up there.</i>

820
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,090
<i>[Leona] Marco.</i>

821
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,803
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

822
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,514
<i>You're actually here.</i>

823
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,809
<i>[Leona] I am so sorry.</i>

824
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,271
<i>I know that all of this is my fault.</i>
<i>Everything...</i>

825
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,106
<i>is my fault.</i>

826
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,316
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-No, no, just let me...</i>

827
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,485
<i>Let me say this.</i>

828
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:03,990
<i>I have made...</i>

829
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,200
<i>so many mistakes.</i>

830
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,746
<i>You didn't deserve what happened to you,</i>
<i>Marco.</i>

831
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,042
<i>I am so...</i>

832
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,295
<i>sorry.</i>

833
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,429

837
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,483
<i>Okay, Leona,</i>
<i>give me the gun and the detonator.</i>

838
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,943
<i>It's okay. I'm a cop.</i>

839
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,111
<i>Yeah.</i>

840
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,613
<i>You're a cop.</i>

841
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,117
<i>And I don't know</i>
<i>what Marco told you, so...</i>

842
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,369
<i>I can't take any chances.</i>

843
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,377
<i>[Leona] Everybody, get in the corner.</i>

844
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,837
<i>Hurry.</i>

845
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,714

<i>What's going on? The wife came in?</i>

852
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,406
<i>So is it all good?</i>
<i>Maybe I don't have to do this anymore.</i>

853
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,033
<i>Yeah, actually...</i>

854
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,993
<i>you might want to hurry up.</i>

855
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,123
<i>-[Marco coughs]</i>
<i>-[Leona] Is he still alive?</i>

856
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,335
<i>Yeah, he always was tougher </i>
<i>than he was smart.</i>

857
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,629
<i>You were involved in the robbery.</i>

858
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,341
<i>I wasn't involved in the robbery.</i>
<i>I masterminded it.</i>

859
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,053
<i>This idiot and his army bros</i>
<i>couldn't plan a trip to the beach.</i>

860
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,057
<i>So Marco never wanted us to find you</i>
<i>so he could apologize. He wanted to...</i>

861
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,351
<i>take out his final partner.</i>

862
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,769
<i>Yeah.</i>

863
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,938
<i>It was a pretty good trap.</i>

864
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,815
<i>Force the police to find me.</i>

865
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:05,111
<i>If I don't show, he blows my cover </i>
<i>and, if I do, well...</i>

866
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,237
<i>[laughs]</i>

867
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,199
<i>I mean, that was the plan,</i>
<i>wasn't it, Marco?</i>

868
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,619
<i>You weren't expecting me</i>
<i>to play on your emotions, were you?</i>

869
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,914
<i>You always were such a softie.</i>
<i>[Marco yells]</i>

870
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,499
<i>[Chloe] What now?</i>

871
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:22,420
<i>You go outside and tell them</i>
<i>Marco apologized and let you go.</i>

872
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,382
<i>[Chloe] Then what? The place explodes</i>
<i>and it's all Marco's fault?</i>

873
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,259
<i>Sounds like a pretty solid plan to me.</i>

874
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,303
<i>[Ella, breathing hard]</i>

875
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,722

876
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,849
<i>Like, right now.</i>

877
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,725
<i>Okay, this is not like the diagram online.</i>

878
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,980
<i>Okay. Big guy...</i>

879
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,941
<i>I know it's been a while, but...</i>

880
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,652
<i>I'm going to really need a sign here.</i>

881
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,405
<i>[Chloe] You don't need to do this, Leona.</i>

882
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,406
<i>Sorry.</i>

883
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,033
<i>I have worked too hard to go to jail now.</i>

884

<i>After rebuilding my life.</i>

885
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,872
<i>Do you know what kind of ordnance</i>
<i>Marco used?</i>

886
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,623
<i>How far away you need to be...</i>

887
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,792
<i>before you hit the detonator?</i>

888
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,004
<i>What are you going to do with that thing</i>
<i>after you hit the button?</i>

889
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,422
<i>Nice try.</i>

890
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,716

<i>I go off and do something dramatic</i>

<i>No, you should have let me go in there.</i>

<i>Marco wouldn't be in an ambulance.</i>
<i>The woman was an amateur.</i>

<i>It was right there.</i>

953

<i>The connections she had for the fake ID.</i>

954
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,784
<i>Insisting I let her go inside to face him.</i>

955
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,787
<i>Like I said Dan,</i>
<i>you have to think like a criminal.</i>

<i>And remember the woman</i>
<i>who actually knows how to use her knife.</i>

<i>-That is just it.</i>

<i>I was in there.</i>

962

<i>I was in there.</i>
<i>I was right in the middle of it.</i>

963
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,100
<i>And I asked him for a sign</i>

964
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:50,020
<i>and that's when I realized,</i>
<i>Dan, I wasn't going to get one.</i>

965
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:54,566
<i>I wasn't going to get one</i>
<i>because I had to count on myself,</i>

966
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,734
<i>because...</i>

967
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,113
<i>God doesn't exist!</i>

968
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,198

<i>-A little ecstasy.</i>

<i>-Oh, my God, you smell amazing.</i>

<i>-well, everything.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

982
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,144
<i>That I'm an angel.</i>

983
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,145
<i>[laughs]</i>

984
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,396
<i>How are you?</i>

985
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,898
<i>I mean, it is a lot to process.</i>

986
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:35,816
<i>Yeah.</i>

987
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,985
<i>It is, it is.</i>

988
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:42,239
<i>But I didn't know who else to talk to</i>
<i>about this.</i>

989
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,909
<i>Right? My job is to read people, to...</i>

990
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:51,123
<i>understand their motives,</i>
<i>to make sense of the world.</i>

991
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,625
<i>And, right now, my world is...</i>

992
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,461
<i>celestials and...</i>

993
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,880
<i>immortals and...</i>

994
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,924
<i>Okay, look. Is Eve...</i>

995
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,843
<i>okay?</i>

996
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,261
<i>Is Eve...</i>

997
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,597
<i>secretly evil or...</i>

998
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,808
<i>some supernatural threat to the world?</i>

999
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,352
<i>Not that I know of, no.</i>

1000
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,229
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1001
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,564
<i>I thought so.</i>

1002
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,941
<i>Because, you know, I like her.</i>

1003
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,777
<i>I do too.</i>

1004
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,654
<i>Yeah, and I think she genuinely...</i>

1005
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,157
<i>cares deeply about Lucifer.</i>

1006
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,453
<i>And she is so protective over him.</i>

1007
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,790
<i>I practically had to force her</i>
<i>to leave his side and...</i>

1008
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,418
<i>I think she might be good for him.</i>

1009
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,339
<i>I think she might be</i>
<i>exactly what he needs.</i>

1010
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,508
<i>I hope that's the case.</i>

1011
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,343
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

1012
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,140
<i>After all that you've been through,</i>
<i>Chloe...</i>

1013
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,938
<i>what you're worried about most is</i>
<i>what's best for those that you care about.</i>

1014
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,734
<i>No wonder your dad is so proud of you.</i>

1015
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,989
<i>Oh, that's sweet,</i>
<i>but, you know, my dad, he...</i>

1016
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,200
<i>He...</i>

1017
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:12,871
<i>Oh!</i>

1018
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,707
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1019
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,167
<i>Right.</i>

1020
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,128
<i>Thank you.</i>

1021
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,592
<i>["Good As Gold" by Moon Taxi playing]</i>

1022
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,604
<i>You know, I'm really happy</i>
<i>you're going back to work.</i>

1023
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:42,568
<i>Adam's idea of paradise</i>
<i>was laying around all day doing nothing.</i>

1024
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,487
<i>Once we got ESPN up there, forget it.</i>

1025
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,698
<i>Well, sadly</i>
<i>there'll be a lot less lying around here</i>

1026
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,700
<i>now that I'm back to catching killers.</i>

1027
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:54,496
<i>But there are certain perks to having</i>
<i>a boyfriend who works with the LAPD.</i>

1028
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,332
<i>An endless supply of handcuffs, for one.</i>

1029
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,751
<i>Boyfriend?</i>

1030
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:00,836
<i>Well, I...</i>

1031
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,089
<i>once someone tends to you</i>
<i>when you're bleeding to death,</i>

1032
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,091
<i>it's only good manners</i>
<i>to make it official.</i>

1033
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,309
<i>So...</i>

1034
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,394
<i>we're really doing this?</i>

1035
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,647
<i>I'll finish making your drink</i>
<i>and we'll toast to it.</i>

1036
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,108
<i>-Ooh! </i>
<i>-Careful!</i>

1037
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:25,986
<i>You're fine.</i>

1038
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,742
<i>What is it with you</i>
<i>only getting injured sometimes?</i>

1039
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,036
<i>Oh, I'm only vulnerable</i>
<i>when the detective's around.</i>

1040
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,203
<i>What?</i>

1041
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,496
<i>Oh...</i>

1042
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:41,293
<i>I totally forgot.</i>
<i>My snake costume finally arrived.</i>

1043
