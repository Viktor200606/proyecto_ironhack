1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,277
That was close.

2
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:08,716
God, I love the smell
of paintballs in the morning.

3
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:11,218
Yeah, still funny.

4
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:15,597
We can't get to the ridge.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,933
The Chemistry Department
has us completely cut off.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,309
And the creek bed?

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,382
The Pharmacology Department
controls that,

8
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:24,185
and they're all hopped up
on experimental steroids.

9
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:26,359
That's it then.
We're doomed.

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,855
The time has come to acknowledge
that we are paying the price

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,798
for some of us failing to attend

12
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:33,014
my Physics Department
paintball strategy meeting.

13
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:35,469
I told you my mom has spider veins.

14
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,352
I had to take her
to the laser clinic.

15
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:42,701
And I told you I wanted
to see a doctor's note.

16
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,242
We need a plan.

17
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:47,156
How about
Operation Hammer of the Gods?

18
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,756
Which one is Hammer of the Gods?

19
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,934
We hide behind the dumpsters
in the parking lot

20
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,281
and ambush people
when they come to pee.

21
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:56,930
No go. The dumpsters are deep
in Astronomy Department territory.

22
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,428
That shouldn't be a problem.
Venus is up during the day.

23
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:01,768
They're probably just all
staring at the sky.

24
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:04,132
What we need now
is a tactical retreat.

25
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:06,228
Did you see
the episode of <i>Stargate</i>

26
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:08,458
where they found themselves
on a planet

27
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,357
with a culture based loosely
on Earth's Athens and Sparta?

28
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:13,212
Not important.

29
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,615
Leonard, Raj and I are going
to burst out the door and run away.

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,113
Howard will cover us.

31
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:20,059
Why don't I run away
and you cover me?

32
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:22,581
Because you chose
your mother's veins over victory.

33
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:25,580
On three.
One, two, three, go!

34
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:32,449
I had to take her!
It's almost bathing suit weather!

35
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,391
I surrender! Don't shoot!
They went that way!

36
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,011
Howard, I'm on your team.

37
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:45,975
Leslie, thank God.

38
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:49,774
Where's the rest of your squad?

39
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:52,496
They left me here to die.

40
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:54,064
What about yours?

41
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,574
- Dead, all of them.
- Sorry.

42
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,125
Don't be.

43
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,045
It was friendly fire.

44
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:03,702
They just wouldn't listen.

45
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,262
Well, we're surrounded,

46
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:10,495
so I guess there's nothing
for us to do

47
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,111
but wait to be captured or killed.

48
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:16,601
That's the worst part, the waiting.

49
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,244
All the while knowing
that there's a paint pellet out there

50
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:21,964
with your name on it.

51
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,688
The big wet ball of death.

52
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,096
Kind of makes you feel
more alive, doesn't it?

53
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:36,465
It kind of does.

54
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,818
I say we make every moment count.

55
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:42,432
I agree.

56
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,789
How exactly do we do that?

57
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,460
Why aren't you covering us?!
We're getting slaughtered out here!

58
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:55,432
War is hell.

59
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:19,436
Subtitles: The FW Team

60
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:22,972
Did you guys see the budget nemo
that went out this morning?

61
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,399
More cutbacks.

62
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,746
Unacceptable.
It baffles me

63
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:28,808
why they don't simply
let some of you go

64
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,292
so that there's money available
for my research.

65
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:34,711
You know what baffles me?

66
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:38,439
Based on your academic record,
any number of things, I imagine.

67
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,426
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

68
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,128
I got the approval
for the rapid prototyper you wanted.

69
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:45,139
That's great, Leslie. Thanks.

70
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,747
You scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

71
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:53,119
What was all that about?

72
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:54,474
No big deal.

73
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,439
They gave Leslie control
of some unrestricted grant money.

74
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,745
Yeah, okay, but what's
with the back-scratching and the meow?

75
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:05,997
I believe the back-scratching
metaphor generally describes

76
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,687
a quid pro quo situation
where one party provides

77
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:12,542
goods or services to the second party
in compensation for a similar action.

78
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,120
- Thank you.
- The meow,

79
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,387
that sounded to me
like an African civet cat.

80
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,676
Are you done?

81
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,902
Despite what the name suggests,

82
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:28,051
the civet cat is not a true cat.

83
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,488
Now I'm done.

84
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,916
You know what I'm thinking?

85
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,514
I'm thinking Howard wasn't making
a back-scratching metaphor.

86
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,702
I'm thinking there was some
actual scratching involved.

87
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:45,242
What about it?

88
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:47,819
I didn't want to say anything

89
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:50,200
'cause I know
you and Leslie have a little history.

90
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,640
I don't care about that.

91
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:53,751
Great, I've been
dying to say something.

92
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:57,503
- You and Leslie?
- In the paintball shed! Twice!

93
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:02,838
Is that why you didn't cover our escape
and let us get cut down like animals?

94
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:05,511
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

95
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:10,543
My good man, dereliction of duty
in the face of the enemy

96
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:12,185
is a court-martial offense.

97
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:14,597
Court-martial, schmort-martial,

98
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:17,769
Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl
I've ever had sex with.

99
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:20,494
I mean, for free.

100
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:24,093
Plus, you got a rapid prototyper.

101
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:26,200
That's an expensive
piece of equipment.

102
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,468
And the rest of us have had
our budgets cut to the bone.

103
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:31,018
One way to look at this

104
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:33,414
is that I'm getting new equipment,
and you're not,

105
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:35,106
and that's unfair.

106
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:38,454
But a better way to look at this
is that I'm getting sex

107
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,880
and you're not,
and that's delightful.

108
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:46,130
The whole thing froze.
I don't know what happened.

109
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:48,507
- Calm down. We'll figure it out.
- How can I calm down?

110
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:50,582
I'm gonna lose
my whole shopping cart.

111
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:54,102
That's three hours of picking out shoes
just shot to hell.

112
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,270
- Hello, Penny.
- Hello, Sheldon.

113
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,957
You're in my spot.

114
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:02,856
- Are you planning on sitting here?
- No, I'm going to the comic book store.

115
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,656
- Then what difference does it make?
- What difference does it make?

116
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:06,986
Here we go.

117
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,355
That is my spot.

118
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,787
In an ever-changing world,
it is a single point of consistency.

119
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,034
If my life

120
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,803
were expressed as a function

121
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:18,390
on a four-dimensional Cartesian
coordinate system,

122
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:20,911
that spot at the moment
I first sat on it

123
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:23,112
would be zero-zero-zero-zero.

124
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
What?

125
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,380
Don't sit in his spot.

126
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:35,091
Fine.

127
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,887
- Happy?
- I'm not unhappy.

128
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:45,672
Boy, I love him, but he is one
serious wackadoodle.

129
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:48,442
Okay, that should do it.

130
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,451
Thank you. You are a lifesaver.

131
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:52,577
That's a lot of shoes you ordered.

132
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:55,793
Yeah, you know the sad thing is,
it's really not.

133
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:00,539
Is this one of those paintball guns?

134
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:02,959
You ought to come out
with us sometime.

135
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:04,625
No, thanks. I'm from Nebraska.

136
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,874
When we shoot things,
it's because we want to eat them

137
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,719
or make them leave
our boyfriends alone.

138
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:31,041
Boy, your heart's racing.
I must've really gotten you going.

139
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:32,880
Well, it's partly you,

140
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:35,729
partly my transient
idiopathic arrhythmia.

141
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:38,598
Sexy.

142
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:44,245
Can I assume that you've likewise
found the experience...

143
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,250
Satisfactory?

144
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,208
That wasn't quite the word
I was looking for,

145
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,483
but sure, I'll do this pass-fail.

146
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:56,282
Are you enjoying
that prototyper I got you?

147
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,738
It's great.

148
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:01,229
Everybody in the Engineering Department
is eating their hearts out.

149
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,249
Isn't it nice when your good fortune
makes others miserable?

150
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:09,607
You know, most people
don't get that.

151
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:12,673
<i>Howard, I'm home!</i>

152
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,121
- Oh, great.
- <i>Book club was cancelled!</i>

153
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:21,203
<i>That thing on Phyllis's neck
opened up again!</i>

154
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:24,755
I'm busy, Ma!

155
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,934
<i>Too busy to help your mother
with her zipper?!</i>

156
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,051
- Don't come in, Ma!
- <i>Why not?</i>

157
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:33,137
He's got company!

158
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,393
There's the arrhythmia.

159
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:42,938
<i>Is she Jewish?!</i>

160
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:45,987
Are you Jewish?

161
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:47,440
- No.
- Yes!

162
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,654
<i>Okay, then you kids have fun!</i>

163
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,875
<i>Use protection!</i>

164
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:07,500
You think he'll notice?

165
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:10,840
There's a chance.

166
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,510
What are we gonna do?

167
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,887
"We"?

168
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,428
No, you had your chance to be "we"

169
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:20,349
for, like, a year and a half now.

170
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:25,105
Right now, you are "you,"
and you are screwed.

171
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:30,861
- Why do we have to tell him I did it?
- We're not gonna tell him I did it.

172
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,998
Okay, okay, how about this?

173
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:36,219
We tell him somebody broke in.

174
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:42,273
Just to shoot the couch
with a paintball gun?

175
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:45,708
I'm sorry, I buy it.
All those people are on drugs.

176
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:50,546
We could tell him they wanted the couch
to stay away from their boyfriend.

177
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:55,315
Okay, fine.
What if we just flip it over?

178
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,593
There. Looks fine, right?

179
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:01,255
Butt print.

180
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,467
There's no discernible butt print.

181
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:06,096
Oh, come on.

182
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,153
There, butt print.

183
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:13,246
It's too small and too...

184
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
perfect.

185
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,922
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

186
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,452
Act normal.

187
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,668
- How was the comic book store?
- Fine. The new issue of <i>Flash</i> is out.

188
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:29,304
Great, great.

189
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:32,005
Did you walk the whole way?
It's a little chilly.

190
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,259
- Koothrappali picked me up.
- Isn't that terrific?

191
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,101
He is such a good friend.

192
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,763
You know what the best thing
about friends is?

193
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,044
They don't talk incessantly
for no particular reason.

194
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,993
No, friends forgive
the little things.

195
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:49,606
- I gotta go home and wash my hair.
- Don't you dare, missy.

196
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,596
Hello, fastest man alive.

197
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:58,394
Want to see me read
your entire comic book?

198
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:00,917
Want to see it again?

199
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,087
Something's wrong.

200
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,360
- What do you mean?
- I'm not sure.

201
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,117
It doesn't feel right.

202
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:41,962
I don't know
what you're talking about.

203
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,667
Oh, that. Penny did that.

204
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,892
Excuse me.

205
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:34,461
Why don't you just eat
in your desk chair?

206
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,880
Why don't I just eat
in my desk chair?

207
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:38,296
Here we go.

208
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,196
That is my desk chair.
That is where I work.

209
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:44,181
I don't eat in my desk chair

210
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,030
and I don't work in my spot.

211
00:12:46,155 --> 00:12:49,434
I work in my desk chair
and eat in my spot.

212
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,783
Wackadoodle.

213
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,487
You know, there's
kind of an obvious solution here.

214
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:55,612
Get up.

215
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,300
There. Problem solved.

216
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:06,535
Nobody cares where you're going to sit.
You're not crazy.

217
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:12,040
Excuse me,
but the problem is not solved.

218
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:15,141
If your head had been
accidentally amputated,

219
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:17,294
and we transplanted a dog's head
in its place,

220
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,297
would that be "problem solved"?

221
00:13:19,718 --> 00:13:21,508
If it were your head, it would be.

222
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,897
I am really, really sorry,
but it's only for a week.

223
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,681
Can't you be a little bit flexible?

224
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:33,949
Yeah, sorry.
I didn't really think that through.

225
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,804
You claimed it's going to be a week,
but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.

226
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:38,710
Why not?

227
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:40,634
Did you notice
the sign on his counter?

228
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,829
He's not a full-time dry cleaner.

229
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:44,927
He also makes keys.

230
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,534
For God's sake, Sheldon.

231
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,952
Focus is important.

232
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:53,165
Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner
in between heart transplants?

233
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,461
Did Alexander Fleming moonlight
as a hairdresser?

234
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:59,126
"Thanks for discovering penicillin.
Now how about we try a bouffant?"

235
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:06,150
Looks like I'm gonna
have sex tonight.

236
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:07,926
Hey, baby.

237
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:09,936
His right hand is calling him?

238
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,979
No, it's Leslie Winkle.
It's a long story.

239
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,623
I'll pick you up in ten minutes.

240
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,268
Gentlemen, <i>adieu</i>.

241
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,823
I thought we were going
to play Halo tonight.

242
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,508
What am I supposed to do?

243
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,531
There's a woman out there
anxious to have sex with me.

244
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:33,165
You understand, right?

245
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:38,705
No. Not at all.

246
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:42,524
Nevertheless, I must depart.
By the way, did I tell you?

247
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,072
Leslie pulled some strings
and got me on the research trip

248
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:47,594
to Geneva to check out
the CERN Supercollider.

249
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,013
That's not fair.
You're not even a physicist.

250
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,098
There are two ways
of looking at this...

251
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,684
- Get out.
- Bye.

252
00:14:57,888 --> 00:14:59,154
You're improving.

253
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:01,970
Thank you.

254
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:05,193
It helps when I get to practice
with a real woman.

255
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:08,368
Listen.

256
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:11,201
Saturday my sister's getting married.
I want you to come with me.

257
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:12,729
It's black tie.

258
00:15:13,398 --> 00:15:14,532
Yeah, gee...

259
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:16,573
I'd really rather not.

260
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,333
Why not?

261
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:22,854
When I go to weddings,
it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids.

262
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:25,148
I don't know what I would do
with a date.

263
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:28,625
All right. I understand.

264
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:30,551
Thanks.

265
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,806
I'm really sorry
about that Geneva trip.

266
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,886
- What about it?
- Didn't you hear?

267
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:41,078
I reduced the number of people going,
and you didn't make the cut.

268
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:43,836
When did that happen?

269
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:45,461
About 12 seconds ago.

270
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,126
Well, hold on.
Are you... saying

271
00:15:50,251 --> 00:15:52,951
if I don't go to the wedding,
I can't go to Geneva?

272
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,600
Actually, I'm trying not to say it.

273
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:57,535
Okay, I'm sorry,

274
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,708
but that makes me
a little uncomfortable.

275
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,133
- How so?
- 'Cause it's like you're controlling me

276
00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:05,129
with new equipment
and research trips.

277
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,015
If I weren't controlling you
with new equipment and research trips,

278
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,260
- then I'd be uncomfortable.
- How so?

279
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,227
'Cause we'd be in a real relationship
with feelings and all that crap.

280
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,476
So, bottom line, I'm just a...

281
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,796
bought-and-paid-for sex toy.

282
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:27,792
No, not at all.

283
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:29,549
You're also arm candy.

284
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,730
So?

285
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,262
What do you think?

286
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,889
Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!

287
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:39,722
<i>Right now?</i>

288
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:43,407
<i>What kind of sex
are you having up there?</i>

289
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:54,346
Why are you crouching there?

290
00:16:54,873 --> 00:16:56,234
This is my spot.

291
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,517
Where else am I supposed to crouch?

292
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:02,927
I don't know. Texas?

293
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:08,766
Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners,
good as new.

294
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:11,256
Really? Great.
Sheldon, look. Good as new.

295
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,032
From that key maker,
I highly doubt it.

296
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:17,661
Come on, Sheldon.
Just give it a try.

297
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:20,680
All right.

298
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:27,212
There, nice and comfy cozy.
Zero, zero, zero.

299
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:29,727
There's one more zero.

300
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:33,176
You forgot the time parameter.

301
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:35,396
Sit on the damn couch.

302
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,313
What do you mean, "nope"?
What's wrong with it?

303
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:06,581
Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.

304
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:09,087
It's exactly the same...

305
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:11,715
Penny, I think I know what to do.

306
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,843
Sheldon, I have some bad news.

307
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:16,355
More?

308
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,589
I'm afraid so.

309
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,141
You know the cashew chicken
I get you Monday nights?

310
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,976
Yes. From Szechuan Palace.

311
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:26,855
Szechuan Palace
closed two years ago.

312
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:30,614
What?

313
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,280
Where did my cashew chicken
come from?

314
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,821
Golden Dragon.

315
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:45,719
No, this isn't right.

316
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:49,252
Our food always comes
in Szechuan Palace containers.

317
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:51,781
Yeah, well,
before they went out of business,

318
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:53,576
I bought 4,000 containers.

319
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,772
I keep them in the trunk of my car.

320
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:00,285
But...

321
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:03,343
This changes everything.

322
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:08,181
I thought that might take
his mind off the cushion.

323
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,157
What's real? What isn't?
How can I know?

324
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,613
- You did make that up, right?
- Oh, God, I wish I had.

325
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:20,283
- Leonard?
- Yeah, buddy?

326
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:22,202
I still don't like this cushion.

327
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,374
Okay, first of all,
Penny, thank you for coming.

328
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,914
Thanks for the shoes.

329
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:34,005
Penny is an amazing shot.
We have a real chance to win this week.

330
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,868
- What's the plan?
- Now, we all run out.

331
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:39,596
Sheldon and I will cut
to the left behind these trees.

332
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,639
Raj, Howard and Leslie flank
to the right behind the rocks.

333
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:43,978
We'll have a great view

334
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:46,309
as Penny runs out
and kills everyone else in sight.

335
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:50,188
- Just one thing before we start.
- What is it, Sheldon?

336
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,235
What the hell?!

337
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:57,521
That was for my cushion.

338
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,706
Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.

339
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:01,972
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:05,408
But revenge is a dish
best served cold.

341
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,845
Screw that.

342
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,378
She can't shoot me.
She's dead.

343
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,693
He's right. You can't.

344
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:24,641
Well, if we're going
to descend into anarchy...

345
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:30,937
See you.

346
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:36,619
- Where are you going?
- Surrender, then Denny's.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
