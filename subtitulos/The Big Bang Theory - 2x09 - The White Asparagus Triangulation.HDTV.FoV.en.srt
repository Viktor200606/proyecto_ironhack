1
00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:02,415
Penny, hello.

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,353
Hey, Sheldon.

3
00:00:04,832 --> 00:00:06,139
What is shaking?

4
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:09,971
I'm sorry?

5
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:12,431
It's colloquial,
a conversation opener.

6
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:16,583
So, do you find
the weather satisfying?

7
00:00:16,703 --> 00:00:20,350
Are you currently sharing in the triumph
of some local sports team?

8
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:23,943
What's wrong with you?
You're freaking me out.

9
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:27,256
I'm striking up a casual
conversation with you.

10
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:28,466
S'up?

11
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,459
Please don't do that.

12
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,741
All right, but I'm given to understand
that when you have something awkward

13
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:40,094
to discuss with someone,

14
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,544
it's more palatable to preface it
with banal chit chat.

15
00:00:44,537 --> 00:00:46,687
So, this wasn't
the awkward part?

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,623
All right.

17
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:56,045
S'up?

18
00:00:58,144 --> 00:00:59,971
Oh, good, I used that right.

19
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:05,242
Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has
entered into a new romantic relationship

20
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:07,612
which includes a sexual component?

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,790
Okay, feeling the awkward now.

22
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,066
Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett

23
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:19,456
and she is a highly distinguished
surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.

24
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:21,005
- Leonard told me.
- Good.

25
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:25,123
What he may have left out is how
important this relationship is to me.

26
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:28,341
To you?

27
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:31,451
See, of the handful of women
Leonard's been involved with,

28
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:34,421
she's the only one
I have ever found tolerable.

29
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:40,899
Well, what about me?

30
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:43,999
The statement stands for itself.

31
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,568
Aren't you sweet?

32
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:50,138
Anyway, should you have
any interaction with her,

33
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:53,684
it would be most helpful
that she not see you as a sexual rival.

34
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:58,356
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.

35
00:01:58,823 --> 00:02:01,652
You say that now,
but consider the following scenario:

36
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:04,716
You're sitting in your apartment,
it's late, you're alone.

37
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:08,610
Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup
of estrogen and progesterone

38
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:11,175
and suddenly even Leonard

39
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:13,677
seems like a viable
sexual candidate.

40
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:16,974
Or a "hookup"

41
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,744
as it's referred to
by today's urban youth.

42
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:22,687
- Really?
- Yes. Now, should that happen,

43
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,868
I would ask you to find
some way to suppress your libido.

44
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,090
I could think about you.

45
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,838
Fine, whatever works.

46
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:40,268
Always nice talking
to you, Sheldon.

47
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:41,637
Peace out!

48
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,081
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

49
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:19,272
This is very pleasant.

50
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:23,235
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

51
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,619
And you said there'd never be
enough pasta for the three of us.

52
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:28,576
I stand corrected.

53
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:31,546
You know, Italian housewives
have a rule of thumb.

54
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,427
A handful of dry pasta
about an inch in diameter

55
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,175
is sufficient for each person

56
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,645
as it doubles in volume
when cooked.

57
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:41,730
- That's very interesting.
- Thank you.

58
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,573
She doesn't mean it.
She's just being nice.

59
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:50,558
Well, since Leonard seems to be
dropping the conversational ball,

60
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:52,735
I guess I'll just have
to pick it up.

61
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:02,795
Have you ever witnessed
a violent crime?

62
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:06,782
- No.
- Good.

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,731
What's your favorite fruit?

64
00:04:10,356 --> 00:04:11,378
Strawberries.

65
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:14,317
Technically not a fruit,
but all right.

66
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,844
Where did you do
your medical internship?

67
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,179
Lawrence Memorial
in Galveston, Texas.

68
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:22,348
Really? That's where I was born!

69
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:26,352
You're kidding!

70
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:29,223
I spent so much of my childhood
at that hospital.

71
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:32,524
When I was 12,
I got to ride there in a helicopter.

72
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:35,575
- Why, what happened?
- Radiation burns.

73
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,532
A little mishap while I was
building my own CAT scanner.

74
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:42,953
I'm sorry, you tried to build
your own CAT scanner?

75
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:45,079
No, I didn't try, I succeeded.

76
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,590
In fact, I was briefly
able to see the inside

77
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,976
of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball,
before he caught fire.

78
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:54,148
It led to an interesting
expression in our house:

79
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:56,805
"Not a Snowball's chance
in a CAT scanner."

80
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:02,555
Excuse me.

81
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,015
When I come back, just for fun,

82
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:06,982
the subject will be
alternative history.

83
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:09,735
Specifically, how would
the Civil War have gone differently

84
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:12,523
if Lincoln had been a robot
sent from the future?

85
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:20,511
Look at that,
there's even pasta left over.

86
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,994
Do you understand
that this was supposed to be a date?

87
00:05:24,154 --> 00:05:26,760
I do. Do you?
Because frankly,

88
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,957
you've been in a foul mood
since I sat down.

89
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:36,072
Okay, here's my question.
Why did you sit down?

90
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:40,655
To help.
Look, if you fail at this relationship,

91
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,511
and history suggests you will,

92
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:46,043
then we risk losing
the medical officer

93
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:48,548
that our landing party
has always needed.

94
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,890
What landing party?

95
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,071
You're Kirk, I'm Spock,
Wolowitz is Scotty,

96
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,987
Koothrappali is the guy
who always gets killed...

97
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:03,782
and now we've got McCoy.

98
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:15,400
So, we're all standing around
looking at the post-op X ray

99
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,822
and there it is, clear as day,
right in the guy's chest cavity...

100
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:20,530
one of my earrings.

101
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,423
Oh, my God, what did you do?

102
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:26,256
What do you think I did?

103
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,339
I discreetly slipped off
the other earring,

104
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:31,593
put it in my pocket
and then got the hell out of there!

105
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:34,677
I have a bone to pick with you, sir.

106
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:37,483
Hi, Sheldon.

107
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:39,283
Hi, Stephanie. I'm sorry I'm late,

108
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:42,753
but your companion left
the most indecipherable invitation.

109
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:44,656
What invitation?

110
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,422
"We're going to the movies."

111
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,947
What movie? What theater? What time?

112
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,927
If you were trying to make it
impossible to locate you,

113
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,143
you couldn't have done a better job.

114
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:58,949
Clearly I could have.

115
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:03,479
It took me nearly 20 minutes
to browse the history on your computer

116
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,801
to see what movie
times you looked up.

117
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,430
Wait here, I'll find us seats.

118
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:11,172
- We have seats.
- Not the right seats.

119
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:23,796
What is he doing?

120
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,266
He's finding
the acoustic sweet spot.

121
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:32,361
Does he always do this?

122
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:34,831
Sometimes he brings
a toy xylophone.

123
00:07:42,176 --> 00:07:44,126
I am really sorry about this.

124
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:46,613
No, it's fine.
You know, he's sweet.

125
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:57,788
My apologies, you've been
sitting in it all along.

126
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:01,255
- You want to slide over one?
- No, just sit here.

127
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:18,799
Oh, yeah, this is it.

128
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:26,735
What, Sheldon?

129
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:28,847
What, Sheldon?! What, Sheldon?!

130
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,703
Tell me what you see here.

131
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:35,138
The blunt instrument that will be
the focus of my murder trial?

132
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,706
This is Stephanie's Facebook page.

133
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:40,899
Now, where it should say
"in a relationship," what does it say?

134
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,647
"Stephanie Barnett is single."

135
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,535
Furthermore, earlier this evening,

136
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:47,527
she threw a digital sheep
at some guy named Mike.

137
00:08:50,193 --> 00:08:51,091
Who's Mike?!

138
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,869
Why does he get a digital sheep
and not you?

139
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:56,236
It's just her Facebook page

140
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,439
and we've only been going out
a couple of weeks.

141
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,022
You don't see it, do you?
We're losing her.

142
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:06,845
I'm going to make this
very simple for you.

143
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,803
You are not in this relationship.

144
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:12,803
I am.

145
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:16,362
Ergo, you have no say

146
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,726
in anything that happens
between me and Stephanie.

147
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,028
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

148
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,674
Pursuant to Starfleet
General Order 104,

149
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:28,400
Section A: You are deemed unfit

150
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,966
and I hereby relieve you
of your command.

151
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,913
General Order 104, Section A
does not apply in this situation.

152
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:40,717
- Give me one good reason why not.
- Because this is not <i>Star Trek</i>!

153
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:53,232
What?

154
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,117
This is banana bread.

155
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:59,123
This is a door knob.

156
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:04,180
It's my understanding
that an unsolicited gift of food

157
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,583
can be a precursor
to an impromptu invitation

158
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:08,124
to come in and chat.

159
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:13,074
Would you like to come in?

160
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:15,743
I suppose I could spare
a few minutes.

161
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,008
Were you robbed?

162
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:26,769
How can you be sure?

163
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,215
What do you want?

164
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:32,036
I'm certain this will come
as no surprise to you,

165
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:34,918
but Leonard is failing
in yet another relationship.

166
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:38,191
- He's having problems with Stephanie?
- She's sending virtual livestock

167
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,060
to random men on the Internet.

168
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,480
If I have any hope of keeping
them together, I need data.

169
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,687
Specifically, I need to know exactly
what Leonard did

170
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:49,731
that caused you to pop
an emotional cap in his buttocks.

171
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,648
- What?
- Again, urban slang.

172
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:57,215
In which, I believe I'm gaining
remarkable fluency.

173
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:01,041
So, what is the "down"
and the "low"?

174
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:03,585
And don't worry,
this is all entirely confidential,

175
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,854
so, you feel free to include
any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.

176
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,924
We never got to the bedroom.

177
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:11,683
Because?

178
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:18,306
All right, you know what?
I'll tell you what happened.

179
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,326
We were young,

180
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:23,093
we were very much in love,

181
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:24,798
but we could only communicate

182
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,738
through a time-traveling mailbox
at my lake house.

183
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,560
It's not enough that you made me
watch that movie,

184
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,305
but now you mock me with it?

185
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:42,414
Gentlemen, I have a question

186
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:44,666
about dating and relationships.

187
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:52,841
You told me you were going
to have the talk with him.

188
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:56,574
I've been waiting for someone
to have the talk with me.

189
00:11:57,714 --> 00:11:59,583
More to the point,
it's about finding a way

190
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:01,349
to keep Leonard
and Stephanie together.

191
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:02,766
I don't think you can.

192
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:03,976
Why not?

193
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:07,153
Look at Leonard's record.
27 days with Joyce Kim.

194
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:09,567
During which she defected
to North Korea.

195
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:13,061
Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.

196
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,947
For which she awarded him the nickname
"Speed of Light Leonard."

197
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:20,617
- And the three hour dinner with Penny.
- Which would have been two and a half

198
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:23,074
if they ordered the souffle
when they sat down.

199
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:25,478
Based on the geometric progression,

200
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:28,625
his relationship with Stephanie
should have ended after 20 minutes.

201
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:32,860
Yes, I'm aware of the math.
Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.

202
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,591
The issue remains.

203
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,178
How do we circumvent
his inevitable rejection?

204
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:40,721
If you want to guarantee
his appeal to Stephanie,

205
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:43,956
your best bet would be to kill
all the other men on the planet.

206
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,777
Here's what you shouldn't do.
Don't shpritz him with that body spray

207
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:51,232
from the commercial where the women
undress when they smell it.

208
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:52,836
That doesn't work at all.

209
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:58,121
No matter how much you put on.

210
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:02,018
That's all you've got?
Apocalyptic genocide

211
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:03,683
and "go easy on the cologne"?

212
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:14,268
What?

213
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:27,437
Zucchini bread.

214
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:30,772
- Thank you.
- May I come in?

215
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:33,795
I see.

216
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:36,273
Apparently, my earlier inquiry
regarding you and Leonard

217
00:13:36,393 --> 00:13:37,737
crossed some sort of line.

218
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,031
I apologize.

219
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,158
Well, thank you.

220
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,576
Have you and I returned
to a social equilibrium?

221
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:46,079
- Yes.
- Great.

222
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,239
New topic.

223
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:50,183
Where are you
in your menstrual cycle?

224
00:13:53,595 --> 00:13:54,546
What?!

225
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:58,155
I've been doing some research online,
and apparently, female primates,

226
00:13:58,275 --> 00:14:00,677
you know, apes,
chimpanzees, you...

227
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:05,598
They find their mate more desirable
when he's courted by another female.

228
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,158
Now, this effect is intensified
when the rival female is secreting

229
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:11,312
the pheromones
associated with ovulation.

230
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:13,767
Which brings me back to my question.
Where are you...

231
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,223
Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.

232
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,729
All I'm saying is if they can cure
yellow fever and malaria,

233
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:28,526
why can't they do something
about lactose intolerance?

234
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:32,845
Leonard, you're going
to have to let this go.

235
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:36,284
You had a little cheese dip, you farted.
I thought it was cute.

236
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,450
- You want some more wine?
- Yeah, I mean...

237
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,681
I assume I'm not driving
anywhere tonight.

238
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:00,482
What are you doing?

239
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,798
I have a craving
for white asparagus

240
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,192
that apparently is destined
to go unsatisfied.

241
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:12,286
Excuse me.

242
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:17,545
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm helping you with Stephanie.

243
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,914
By making constipated moose sounds?

244
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,534
When I fail to open this jar
and you succeed,

245
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:25,553
it will establish you
as the "alpha" male.

246
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,347
You see... when a female

247
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:29,592
witnesses an exhibition
of physical domination,

248
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:31,445
she produces the hormone oxytocin.

249
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,383
If the two of you
then engage in intercourse,

250
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,788
this will create
the biochemical reaction in the brain

251
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:38,662
which lay people naively interpret
as "falling in love."

252
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,447
Would it work if I just
punched you in the face?

253
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,587
Yes, actually it would,
but let's see how the lid goes.

254
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:54,624
I'm not strong enough, Leonard,
you'll have to do it.

255
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:58,878
- For God's sakes.
- Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.

256
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:15,020
You want some help with that?

257
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:18,958
I got it.

258
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:21,413
He's got it,
and that's not surprising.

259
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,366
It's something I long ago
came to peace with

260
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:25,179
in my role as the beta male.

261
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:29,023
Open it.

262
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:38,877
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

263
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,003
- I'm bleeding.
- Like a gladiator!

264
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:46,134
- Honey, you're going to need stitches.
- Stitches? With a needle?

265
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:48,428
Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.

266
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:51,932
Yeah, hang on a sec.

267
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:04,853
FYI, I was defrosting
a steak in there.

268
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:11,659
What a beautiful job Stephanie did.

269
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:15,176
I might have gone with a mattress suture
instead of a blanket stitch,

270
00:17:15,296 --> 00:17:16,957
but you can't argue
with her results.

271
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:19,156
It's a shame it won't scar.

272
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:22,783
The war wound is a time-honored
badge of masculinity.

273
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:27,778
I can't remember a time
when you weren't talking.

274
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:32,402
Just for the record, my efforts
to establish you as the alpha male

275
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:34,455
were not aided by you
bursting into tears.

276
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,177
I did not burst into tears,

277
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:38,137
my eyes just got a little watery.

278
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:39,229
Watery?

279
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:42,228
She stuck a needle into my hand!

280
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:45,453
Hey, how's my big cry baby?

281
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,530
I didn't cry.

282
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,246
I'm just teasing you.

283
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:52,784
But, yeah, you did.

284
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:56,997
It's all good. What do you say
we get you home and put you to bed?

285
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:59,194
Are you still going
to spend the night?

286
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,793
No, I think that you probably
need to rest.

287
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:05,389
She's right. As long as you're vomiting,
coitus is contra-indicated.

288
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:08,911
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

289
00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:11,571
You're welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.

290
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:17,295
Okay, I'm going to go
get your discharge papers.

291
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:21,437
What?

292
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:24,107
You seem like
a perfectly pleasant person.

293
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:27,584
I can't understand why women
have such a hard time loving you.

294
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,224
Can you open this for me?

295
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:38,910
- Can I see your stitches?
- Sure.

296
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:46,520
Answering the question
once and for all

297
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,835
why Wolowitz bailed out
of medical school.

298
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,636
- Leonard, congratulations.
- What for?

299
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:54,488
Your Facebook status update.

300
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:57,641
Leonard Hofstadter is
"in a relationship."

301
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,929
What? No, that's not right.

302
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,718
Oh, man, did you switch
your status before she did?

303
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:08,104
Speaking as an expert,
way to look needy.

304
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:12,210
Seriously? You went first,
after only two weeks?

305
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:13,915
That's bold...

306
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,274
It's not bold, it's a mistake.

307
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:18,223
I didn't change my status.

308
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:19,798
Well, then who did?

309
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,338
I had no choice.
He cried in front of her.

310
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,466
You hacked my Facebook account?

311
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,117
It's hardly hacking

312
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:36,143
when you use the same password
for everything, "Kal-El."

313
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:40,892
Are you insane?
Now she's going to think I'm desperate.

314
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:45,000
You've destroyed this relationship!
And you know what the worst part is?

315
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,354
You don't even understand
what you did wrong

316
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:50,944
because you can't conceive of something
that you are not an expert in!

317
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,239
- In which I am not an expert.
- Don't even!

318
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,703
I don't want to hear
another word out of you.

319
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,908
What's wrong, Lassie?
Timmy fall down the well?

320
00:20:11,102 --> 00:20:13,300
She just updated
her Facebook status.

321
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:15,981
"Stephanie Barnett is
in a relationship

322
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:17,804
"with Leonard Hofstadter."

323
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:20,181
Really?

324
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,185
Look at that.

325
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:25,801
I have a girlfriend.

326
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:28,769
If I am permitted to speak again,

327
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:31,332
Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.
