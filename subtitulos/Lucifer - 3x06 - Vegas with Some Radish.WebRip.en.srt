00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,364
- Previously on Lucifer...
- Still no sign of Lucifer?

2
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:05,806
I went by his place.
He's gone.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,475
Lucifer, who is this?

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,377
Meet Candy Morningstar, my wife.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,512
The issue? That would be
Lucifer disappearing

6
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,814
and then popping back up
with zero explanation

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,117
and a ditzy bimbo on his arm.

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,278
I thought that she meant
something to you.

9
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:19,053
I had to save her from...

10
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:21,182
From you. You're not ignoring
Chloe, you're protecting her.

11
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:24,158
Are you going to Paris?
Can I be your travel buddy?

12
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,393
I love Paris.

13
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:28,762
This is the Paris Hotel
in Vegas.

14
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,731
Not going there.

15
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,800
Vegas and me... not pretty.

16
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,336
And I have held
the real truth back from you.

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,537
Why is it not working?

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,805
You know, I keep caring,

19
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,141
and you just... just...

20
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,676

Candy, is missing.

Oh, my gosh,
I hope she's okay, buddy.

taken care of it.

Nasty business?
Yes.

80
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,849
In exchange, she helped me
with a delicate matter.

81
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,585
I hate to think I haven't
fulfilled my end of the bargain.

00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:18,766
Oh, yeah, you know, I kind of

88
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,801
have a thing with Vegas.

totally offer to go with you.

00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:25,873
Right. Good to know.

91
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,609
But then, I can tell that
it's really important to you,

92
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,479
and I do have the next
couple of days off, so...

93
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,847
okay, you've convinced me.

94
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,815

Help him with what?

00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,587
Uh... Please don't tell me you
guys got another stripper.

No, he got a...
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

thing only, Detective.

103
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,932
Yeah, I'll call you later.

104
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,301
Wait.

105
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,468
Seriously, Detective,

106
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:57,037
you just stay here.

107
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,606
It's my birthday.

108
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,341
Shake your booty
while you still can.

109
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,476
Oh, there you go.

110
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,586
Mmm, you smell that?

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,456

112
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,990
and vomit, my friend.

113
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,527
I have to say, I didn't
have a good Catholic girl

114
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,895
like yourself pegged
as a fan of Sin City.

115
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,431
Mm, not a fan, exactly.

116
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,833
More like a tiny,
helpless space capsule

117
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,769
being sucked into
a deadly black hole.

118
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,739
Anyway, shall we?

119
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,840

You know what they say,
fifth time's the charm.

122
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,315
Lucifer, you should really
tell her what's going on.

123
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:43,317
It's still her birthday.

124
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,018
And you're still
going with that.

125
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,787
Okay.

126
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,556
Officer.

127
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,431
Either it's someone
else's birthday...

128
00:04:57,465 --> 00:05:00,000
Or this is an
active crime scene.

129
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,405
Oh, no.

130
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,573

Oh, Lucifer,

132
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,343
I'm so sorry, buddy.

133
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,346
Man, her face is gone.

134
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,047
Hello.

135
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,583

136
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:21,789
Okay, not judging here,
but really?

137
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,891
Is this really the time
for the pervy stuff?

138
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,125
Dainty feet?

139
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,795
Um, debatable, but that's not
what I was talking about.

140
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,464
No, Candy has ginormous feet.

00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,732
I mean, regular boats,

00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:32,900
huge.

143
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,968

this is not Candy.

163
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,147
Well, that's because this woman
is not my wife.

Right, 'cause she's
your ex-wife.

Ella Lopez, LAPD CSI.

168

For the record,
we just got into town.

169

a visual assessment

172

of the victim's lividity,

173
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:45,105
she's been deceased for,
oh, I'd say

174
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,675
2100 hours yesterday.

175

none of my beeswax, but...

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,054
man, but you know what,

182
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,523
to each his own.

183
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,691
Okay, thanks for the advice.

184
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,092
You got it, Detective.

185
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,096
Ixnay on the ot-nay andy-cay.

186
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,798
Sorry, is that German?
'Cause if it is,

187
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:11,999
it's absolutely awful.

188
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,067
Trust me, I should know.
Hitler was a talker.

189
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,168
Well, screamer, actually.

190
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,971
No, I'm saying that for now,

191
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,808
we shouldn't let LVPD know that
that's not Candy.

192
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,810
If this gets back to the killer,

193
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,778
he might try to kill her again.

194
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,581
Oh, right, yes.
Good idea, Ms. Lopez.

195
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:30,183
Good idea.
What's a good idea?

196
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,184
Um...
Um...

197
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,087
To give you my card.

198
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,222
Her card.

199
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,691
In case you want
any more advice.

200
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,727
Always happy to help.

201
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,595
She's very good.
Very.

202
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,064
Right. I have a feeling
I will be talking

203
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,567
to both of you again
before the investigation's over.

204
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,835
I doubt that.

205
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,703
I mean, hanging out
with a cop in Las Vegas

206
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,672
is like bringing your grandma
to an orgy.

207
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,073
Am I right?

208
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,975
No.

209
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,209
Okay, bye.

210
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,778
Bye.

211
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:04,985
Hi.

212
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,187
Is, uh...
Hi, sorry to interrupt.

213
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,622
Have you heard from Lucifer?

214
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,624
No, why?
Has something happened?

215
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,225
No, not really.
I just, I, uh...

216
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,927
I had a question about a case,

217
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,063
and, um, I can't...
I can't get ahold of him.

218
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,164
Yeah, we were...

219
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,867
we were, uh, celebrating
my birthday at the precinct,

220
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,669
and, um, and then,
all of a sudden,

221
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,638
he just bailed, and now he's
not answering my calls, so...

222
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,675
Would you like to have a seat?

223
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,910
No, no, it's not a big deal.

224
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,144
You sure?

225
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,180
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I'm fine.

226
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,748
I'm fine.

227
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:36,650
It's probably just
Lucifer being Lucifer.

228
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,251
You know? Probably.

229
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,689
Yeah.

230
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:44,892
Please, have a seat.

231
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,894
I don't really, you know...

232
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,096
I know you're busy,
and I don't want to...

233
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,032
take up... I-I checked Lux,
and he wasn't there.

234
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,267
And-and I thought I'd go up
to the penthouse to check,

235
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,569
but last time he went AWOL,

236
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,204
I went up there to check on him,

237
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,139
and all of his furniture
was covered in sheets,

238
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,774
and he had run off to Vegas.

239
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:02,710
Of course, that's when we...

240
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,579
we were getting together,
which we totally are not

241
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:06,880
anymore, nor will we.

242
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:09,817
But, you know, it's my birthday.

243
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,285
Mm-hmm.

244
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,588
Wow, good couch.

245
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:15,756
I know.

246
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,259
And I understand.

247
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,595
Birthdays can be emotional.

248
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:22,830
I guess.

249
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,331
No, I'm good, I'm good.

250
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,667
He's, um... he's probably
just in the penthouse

251
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,001
passed out or something.

252
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,604
Emphasis on "something."

253
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:33,073
How about I go with you?

254
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,111
Please.

255
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,814
Seems Candy dodged a
bullet, quite literally.

256
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,215
Or a shotgun blast, anyway.

257
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,251
Yes, so, we need
to find this killer

258
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,254
before he or she
realizes their mistake.

259
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,657
Detective Nosy in there
could get DNA back

260
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,224
on that body within 24 hours.

261
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,693
Yeah.

262
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,261
So, we got to find a lead, stat.

263
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,096
Right. Okay, so you
were married to Candy

264
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,165
for a week...
Uh, two weeks.

265
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,735
Mm-hmm. I mean, any idea
who would want her dead?

266
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:12,079

Who is she?

Not the one singing,
the reason you're drinking.

278
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,741

That was Candy.

295
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,208
Aye.

296
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,111
Think I'd quite like to
continue my chat with Candy.

297
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,481
Uh...

298
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,083
Where's my money?

299
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,287
And my ring.

300
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,860
Bravo, Candy.

301
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,095
Emergencies.

302
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,031
Ow, you're hurting me.

303
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,800
Just-just give me
some more time, please.

304
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,869
I'll have it for you.

305
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,907
His name's Louie Pagliani.

306
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,943
He's a local loan shark
and all-around dirtbag.

307
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,444
I thought I dealt
with that human stain

308
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,780
last time I was here.

309
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,148
Yeah, well...
this is Vegas.

310
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,350
This town is always
up for an encore.

311
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,862
Ah, there you go.

312
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,031
They teach lock picking
in forensic class?

313
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,866
No. Middle school.

314
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,469
Ms. Lopez, you are an enigma,
wrapped in a hoodie

315
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,238
under a jaunty ponytail.

316
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,473
It...

317
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:23,376
Oh, no.

318
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,045
The annihilation.

319
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,880
Ugh.

320
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,116
Even if Louie didn't
kill fake Candy,

321
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,952
this decor alone is enough
for immediate execution.

322
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,086
I mean...

323
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,855
What was he thinking?

324
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:38,992
Well, uh, looks like someone
beat you to the execution part.

325
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,799
Louie?

326
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,167
Oh, definitely.

327
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,937
I'd know those hairy
ham hands anywhere.

328
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,077
The trajectory
of the blood spatter

329
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,012
in relation to the stiff
makes zero sense.

330
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,540
There's no way
Louie pulled the trigger.

331
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,016
Typical Vegas.
Even the suicides are fake.

332
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,018
Yeah, and so is the hair color.

333
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,519
Look at this.

334
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,189
It's pink.
Candy.

335
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,025
Well, she was here.

336
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,161
You think Candy
would've killed Louie,

337
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,296
and then faked her own death
to disappear?

338
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,833
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
Candy's not a killer.

339
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,935
No, just a thieving con woman.

340
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,171
You knew her one week.
Two weeks.

341
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,439
Well, you don't know
what she's capable of.

342
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,407
Well...

343
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,543
Candy did owe Louie
money once upon a time,

344
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,879
but I paid him off.

345
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,280
Perhaps he wanted more.

346
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,515
Huh.

347
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,886
This must be Mrs. Ham Hands.

348
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,387
Oh, dearie me.

349
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,223
Someone's sending
a painful message.

350
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,861
If Louie was after
Candy's candy...

351
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:50,097
Maybe his old lady found out,

352
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,500
followed who she thought was
Candy home from the club,

353
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,169
shot her, and then
framed/finished off Louie.

354
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,571
Then we need to find
this murderous ginger

355
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,640
before she finds the real Candy.

356
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,409
Ah, Roxie Pagliani.

357
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,644
I suppose she's the missus.
Just block the caller I.D.

358
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,513
You can't just call her.
What are you gonna say?

359
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,949
Well, I'm gonna ask her
if she's the killer, of course.

360
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,218
No. Terrible plan!

361
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,478
- Give me that!
- What are you doing?

362
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,121
Hello?

363
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,622
Hi, yeah.

364
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,525
This is Marcia calling
from Sensational Statues.

365
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,592
Who?

366
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,094
"Sensational Statues"?

367
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,963
Yeah, yeah,
we got that new, um...

368
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,231
you know, that new...

369
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,199
Oh, bust of Caesar you ordered.

370
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,235
Uh-huh, it came out real sexy.

371
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,337
"Sexy"?
Yeah, 30% off

372
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,640
if we can drop it
wherever you are right now.

373
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,375
I'm sorry,
I didn't buy any bust.

374
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,944
Pfft. You sure? Because I...

375
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,511
Bada bing! Bada bing! Bada bing!

376
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,540
Oh, whoopsie, whoopsie,
my mistake, doll, my mistake.

377
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,514
See?

378
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,917
The truth would've been
much more expedient.

379
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:46,653
Nope. I know exactly
where Roxie is.

380
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,121
I heard the sound

381
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,023
of The Guido's Rainbow
slot machine

382
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,524
in the background of the call.

383
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,126
It's a vintage machine.

384
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,529
And only one casino
in Vegas has it:

385
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,630
The Moonbeam.

386
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:01,534
Well, ka-ching, Ms. Lopez.

387
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,537
Well, no sheets
on the furniture,

388
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,406
that's a good sign.

389
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,474
And...

390
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,442
it looks like...

391
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:10,978
yep, the overnight
bag is missing,

392
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,512
so maybe he did go out of town.

393
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,015
On my birthday.

394
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,642
You know what,
speaking of, this is stupid.

395
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,551
What are we doing here?
We should be celebrating.

396
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,388
Yes! We should
be celebrating.

397
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,556
Yeah.
So, where to?

398
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,724
Hmm.

399
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,728
Actually, I do know this place
with an awesome sound system

400
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,198
and all the top shelf
you can drink.

401
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,334
Best views in the city?

402
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,536
Seems a shame to let
that sunset go to waste.

What you looking at?

420
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,635
Nothing exciting.

421
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,303
I'm Lucifer Morningstar.

422
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:16,343
I can play the piano
and I'm a fancy British man.

423
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,611
Let's go
take a peek in his sock drawer.

424
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,081
But, Dr. Martin,
you're his therapist.

425
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,449
Aren't there rules against that?

426
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,351
Trust me,
there's nothing I don't know

427
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,752
about Lucifer Morningstar.

428
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,221
Except what's in
his sock drawer.

429
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,123
It's not like he can see us.

430
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,691
Let's do it.

431
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,759
Oh!
Oh.

432
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,228
Oh, oh, oh!

433
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,556
That's Lucifer, that's Lucifer.
Oh. Oh.

434
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,098
Yeah, I can see that.
That's Lucifer.

435
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,259
Officially,
officially creeped out!

436
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,567
Okay, don't answer it.

437
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,435
No, no, no, wait.
Answer it, answer it, uh,

438
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:43,770
just don't say we're here.
Okay.

439
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,538
Mmm. Hello?

440
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,674
Ah, Doctor, I didn't
think you were going to answer.

441
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,377
I'm just calling to reschedule
my therapy appointment.

442
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,644
I'm on a quick trip out of town.

443
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,645
Oh!

444
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,247
Oh. Out of town.

445
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,383
Um, uh... where?

446
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,518
Oh, nowhere special,
it's just Vegas.

447
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,819
Vegas? Again?

448
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,521
What you doing in Vegas?

449
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,759
Well...

450
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,495
don't you look ravishing.

451
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,363
Lucifer? Uh, sorry,
I've got to go, Doctor.

452
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,265
Speak soon.
Bye.

453
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,426
What did he say
at the end there?

454
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,069
Um, something about...

455
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,438
radishes.

456
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,509
Well, you are
stunning, aren't you?

457
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,411
I almost didn't recognize you,
no offense.

458
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,379
Eh, it's hard to
get your glitter on

459
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,415
when you're stuck
in a lab all day.

460
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,184
But, I mean, Vegas?

461
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,685
Where else can I bust out
the bling?

462
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,387
There's no reason
we can't look fabulous

463
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,223
and catch a homicidal redhead.

464
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,391
Exactly.

465
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,194
He didn't say "radish."

466
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,230
He said "ravishing," didn't he?

467
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,233
He's in Vegas
with someone ravishing

468
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,567
on my birthday.

469
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,668
You know what?

470
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,138
Why-why do I even care?

471
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,406
Why do I care?
This is stupid.

472
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,408
Okay, feelings,
feelings are not stupid.

473
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,177
Well, this one is, okay?

474
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,313
This feeling is stupid.

475
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,314
Okay.
Okay?

476
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,316
Lucifer and I are friends,

477
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,185
partners, that's all.

478
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,388
I'm totally past
anything romantic.

479
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,323
Full-on rearview.

480
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,225
In. The. Past.
Okay.

481
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,327
It is completely reasonable

482
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:17,130
for something like
a trip to Vegas

483
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:20,200
to trigger old emotions.

484
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,601
Emotions...

485
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,637
that maybe you haven't
completely dealt with.

486
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,473
There's no expiration date

487
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,741
on the process of healing.

488
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,144
We should go.

489
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,245
You're welcome.

490
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,247
Where... where
are my pants?

491
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,349
I was wearing pant...

492
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,784
Oh, this is fine...

493
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,821
Are you okay?

494
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,892
Oh...

495
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,195
Oh...

496
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,397
Screw the sock drawer.

497
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,901
Bada bing! Bada bing! Bada bing!

498
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,870
Oh, that is definitely her.

499
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,507
Mrs. Ham Hands.

500
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,409
It looks like she's
the casino's pit boss.

501
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,411
Right, let's go
and chat up our killer.

502
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,613
Uh, could be a problem.

503
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,915
Pit bosses are notoriously
hard to flush out.

504
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,918
Only clients they pay attention
to are the whales,

505
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,522
the serious high rollers.

506
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:16,923
So, how about blackjack?

507
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,558
More of a poker man, myself.

508
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,226
Poker?

509
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,793
No, poker involves bluffing,

510
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:21,794
also known as lying.

511
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,263
Something you claim

512
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,664
you don't do.

513
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,933
Bluffing and lying,
two totally different things.

514
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,828
So I guess what you're doing
with Chloe, and the whole

515
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:32,739
not telling her you're in Vegas
thing, also not lying?

516
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:36,409
No, that's selective omission.
Get it straight, Lopez.

517
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:37,777
Potato, potahto,
po-too-toe.

518
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,514
You, my friend,
are compartmentalizing.

519
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,316
Don't even know what that means.

520
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,884
Anyways...

521
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,486
Ooh.

522
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,980
Okay, looks like Roxie's
working the blackjack floor.

523
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,823
Mm. So let's, uh, get
you at the table.

524
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,759
What, me?
What about you?

525
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,928
Best I just watch.

Beginner's luck.

Right.

530
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,438

Roxie's attention.

Very good, Ms. Lopez.
See?

544
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,265
You're very good at this,
aren't you?

545
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,466
Teamwork is dream work.

546
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,001
Look at all the money, eh?

547
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,903
Do you know, actually,
I fancy a drink, actu...

548
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,371
- Ooh.
- Here you are.

549
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,606
Wonderful service.
Thank you.

550
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,773
What's your name?

551
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,342
Mmm.

552
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,577
Oh, that's perfect, thanks.

553
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,713
What would you
like, Ms. Lopez?

554
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,981
I-I would like for you
to focus on the game;

555
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,283
you just got two aces.

556
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,818
What? Oh, right.

557
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,320
Well, maybe you would like...
Split!

558
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,721
Sorry.

559
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,924
Ah, it's working,
Ms. Lopez.

560
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,726
Whatever you're doing,
keep doing it.

561
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,761
Yeah, order me one, too.
Hmm?

562
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,499
Oh, well done, Ms. Lopez!

563
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,034
Well done, indeed.

564
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,502
Excuse me, sir.

565
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:10,803
Come with us, please.

566
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:11,738
Oh.

567
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,740
Excellent. It's worked,
it's worked.

568
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,775
Right, off to the high rollers'
suite, are we?

569
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:16,843
♪ Oh, my

570
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,077
♪ Oh...

571
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,713
Yeah, I don't think
that's where they're taking us.

572
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,654
What sort of casino
back room is this anyway?

573
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,081
I mean, where's the
dangling lightbulb

574
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,423
and the bloodstained floor?

575
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,658
Where's Joe Pesci?

576
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,059
Hey, go easy.

577
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,694
I'm going blind here.

578
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,629
It seems maiming us
isn't even in their agenda.

579
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,090
Quite frankly, I'm
disappointed, gentlemen.

580
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,699
Hmm, ooh.

581
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,369
Well, actually, I'm slightly
less disappointed now.

582
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,404
Oh.

583
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,805
It's you.

584
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,940
So maybe this wasn't
a total waste of time.

585
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,377
Mm, maybe we should
stop talking.

586
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,712
And by "we,"
I mean "you."

587
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,991
So, I guess the disguise
didn't do it for you.

588
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:08,395
Very few people can count cards
like you, Ms. Lopez.

589
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,830
Count cards?
Oh, I'm impressed.

590
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,999
So am I.
Your technique's so infamous,

591
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,368
we were able to spot you in,
what was it?

592
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,603
Half an hour?

593
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:19,706
43 minutes.
You guys are getting lax.

594
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,441
Question is,

595
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:22,909
what do I do with you?

596
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:26,779
If banning you from the casino
didn't work,

597
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:30,417
maybe I should call
your new friends

598
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,485
at the LAPD.

599
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,720
Okay.

600
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,588
Fine.
Go right ahead.

601
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:36,892
And, you know,
while you're at it,

602
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:39,392
why don't you tell them
about your crimes?

603
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,927
- What?
- Yes.

604
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,762
J'accuse.
First of all,

605
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,131
of mixing Corinthian
and Doric columns

606
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,499
in your McMansion.

607
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,067
I mean... and secondly,

608
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,137
of killing your husband and who
you thought was his mistress.

609
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,739
Louie's dead?

610
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,107
Hello.

611
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,509
Yes, Louie's dead,

612
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,411
savagely murdered by you.

613
00:22:58,445 --> 00:22:59,679
Hmm.

614
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,880
Wow.

615
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,550
Her poker face is amazing,
take note.

616
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,618
My husband was a crook.

617
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,554
I knew it was
only a matter of time

618
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:08,888
before his ticket got punched.

619
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,023
But I certainly didn't kill him
or anyone else.

620
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,124
Okay.

621
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,627
Very well, Roxie,
if you didn't want Louie dead,

622
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,062
then tell me, what do you want?

623
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,798
I, uh...

624
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:19,666
Yes?

625
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:24,070
I want the pro golfer
on table four.

626
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,906
Bad.

627
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,776
I've been trying to pick up his
sweet ass for two days straight.

628
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:32,178
I worked a triple shift just
to keep him in my sights,

629
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,647
and I think I'm really close
to getting a hole in one.

630
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:35,948
You know what I mean?

631
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:36,683
Oh, dear.

632
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,718
Well, as the detective would say

633
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:39,986
in this situation,

634
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,555
that means no motive.
Or opportunity.

635
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,593
Damn it, 6-6-6 didn't work,
either.

636
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,528
Try 8-0-0-8.

637
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:49,729
8-0-0-8?

638
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,531
It spells "boob."

639
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:52,965
Ah.

640
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,066
No.

641
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,935
You know, normally,
I wouldn't be so concerned

642
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,670
about trying to get
into this thing

643
00:23:57,704 --> 00:23:59,672
if I didn't think there
were some real clues

644
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,140
as to where Lucifer is,

645
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:04,210
'cause wherever he is,
maybe he's in danger.

646
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,945
Right. Maybe "ravishing,"

647
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,213
I mean "radish,"

648
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,815
is code for "help."

649
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:11,584
Yes. Maybe, maybe
that's why he skipped town.

650
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:12,952
'Cause someone's after him.

651
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,722
It would be irresponsible for us
not to open this thing.

652
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:18,124
Or maybe you two
just had too much to drink,

653
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,052
you're a little too curious
to leave well enough alone,

654
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,728
which is why
you hauled my ass out here.

655
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:22,855
That mean
you're not gonna help us?

656
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,764
I didn't say that.

657
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:31,037
Really have quite the grit,
don't you? Hmm?

658
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,873
You have a good time
on your own?

659
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,274
Okay. Ugh.

660
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,578
You are just full of surprises,
aren't you, my little Rain Man?

661
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,012
Well, what can I say?

662
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,714
We all have coping mechanisms,

663
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,716
mine just happens to
be counting cards...

664
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,718
Or, was, anyway.

665
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,119
Coping mechanisms, for what?

666
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,254
Poverty?

667
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:49,556
No.

668
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,091
It helped quiet the voices.

669
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,761
What voices?

670
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,731
Never mind, forget I...
said that.

671
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:01,200
The point is that...

672
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,135
everyone has stuff
that they want to avoid.

673
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,872
You know, like, like the way
you are avoiding Chloe.

674
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:08,007
Ugh, how many times
do I have to tell you?

675
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,643
I am not avoiding
or lying to the detective.

676
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,245
I'm... protecting her.

677
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,583
Ah, you're protecting her,
or you're protecting yourself?

678
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,040
Look, why are we
even discussing this?

679
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,812
Right now, Candy's the one
who needs protecting,

680
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,020
and we've just hit a dead end.

681
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,655
Right. Okay,
but hold on.

682
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,124
I mean, if we are
gonna find a new lead,

683
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,760
how about we start with
how you two ended up married.

684
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:41,173
Hello, Candy.

685
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:43,910
My thieving vixen.

686
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:45,812
I don't know what
you're talking about.

687
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,079
How'd you get in here?

688
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,215
Impressive grift
you've got going.

689
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:53,653
But, uh, I'm afraid that you
can't keep this little beauty.

690
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,288
No, please, please, please,
I'm sorry, I'm sor...

691
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:58,658
Sentimental value.

692
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,193
But, uh, you're welcome
to keep the cash.

693
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,229
Goodness knows
where you've hidden that.

694
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,335
I'm so sorry; please
don't call the cops.

695
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,170
It's just...

696
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,039
my dad died recently and...

697
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,074
he used to own the
club I was singing at.

698
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,743
You know, Fletcher's?
Mm.

699
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,978
But he owed this ginormous
amount of cash

700
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,346
to this super scary loan shark,

701
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:23,650
Louie Pagliani, and he used
the club as collateral,

702
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:26,285
and if I don't come up
with 300 grand, like now,

703
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,354
Louie's gonna take it.

704
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:32,224
And who knows what else.

705
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,861
I didn't know what else to do!

706
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,832
Bravo, you really are
quite the performer, aren't you?

707
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:42,268
You, you don't believe me?

708
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,771
What, the weepy waterworks?
Not a chance.

709
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,640
But your story
seems legit, though.

710
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,345
It is.

711
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,748
And so is my apology.

712
00:26:56,883 --> 00:26:58,918
I actually felt bad.

713
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,252
From the looks of you
at the bar,

714
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,722
you got your own problems
to deal with.

715
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:03,923
Yeah.

716
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,192
Nothing I can't handle
on my own.

717
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,259
You sure about that?

718
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:16,135
And so, you see, I...

719
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,403
I had to leave.

720
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:20,272
Hmm, I get it.

721
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,407
The part about your dad

722
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,677
putting the detective
in your path is kind of fuzzy,

723
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:28,981
but it seems like
you genuinely care about her.

724
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,249
Yes.

725
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,751
I do.

726
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:34,220
A lot.

727
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,455
Then, isn't you going AWOL
gonna kind of throw a big...

728
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,024
flag on that play?

729
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,392
No, I said that
I care about her.

730
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,294
Oh, unrequited love.

731
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,896
Yeah, I get that, too.

732
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,898
No, no, no, it's not unrequited.

733
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,801
It's... well, the detective
has feelings for me,

734
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,329
but she has no control
over those feelings.

735
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,270
Okay, I don't get that.

736
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,039
Well, look,
it's difficult to explain.

737
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:56,943
But I just...

738
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,811
I just want to do right by her.

739
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,080
I believe you. Yeah.

740
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,149
Swap.

741
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:06,318
Do you ever ask yourself,

742
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,055
"How the hell
did I end up here?"

743
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,923
What, eating mint
chocolate chip ice cream,

744
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:12,324
wrapped in a pink Snuggie?

745
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,427
Pink's a good color for you,
actually.

746
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,764
Ah! You are a good
liar, aren't you?

747
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:18,765
I don't lie.

748
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,266
Forgive me,

749
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,734
but you are a con woman.

750
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,736
I am not a con woman.

751
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,104
I am a singer,

752
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:28,240
forced to do some things
that I'm not proud of,

753
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:31,077
but only so I can dig
my dad's club out of debt.

754
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,080
I grew up on that stage.
It's my home.

755
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,849
Drastic measures
for the things we care about.

756
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,150
That, I get.

757
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,854
I might pretend to be someone

758
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,356
a little less threatening
sometimes,

759
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,225
but I don't lie.

760
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:48,795
I call it bluffing.

761
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,029
Totally different things.

762
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,132
Oh, well, that I definitely get.

763
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,234
We're quite similar,
you and I, aren't we?

764
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,169
Yeah, we are.

765
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:01,373
Mm. Except for the fact
that you have ginormous feet.

766
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,374
Oh!

767
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,048
You know...

768
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:13,953
there might be a way for you and
I to dig each other out, Candy.

Uh...

789
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,509
As much as I love the
Bettie Page vibe, you've got

790
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,012
a bull's-eye on your back; this
is hardly a good hiding place.

791
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,273
But it is where my killer works.
What...?

792
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,514
You're onto Roxie as well?

793
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,317
Until you and your sidekick
derailed things.

794
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,286
Not my sidekick, and
I hate to disappoint,

795
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,621
but Roxie Pagliani
did not kill your look-alike.

796
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,023
Ali.

797
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,858
Her name was Ali.

798
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:27,052
She broke up with her boyfriend,

799
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,427
so I said
she could stay with me.

800
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,529
I was just trying
to be a good friend.

801
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,964
Oh, man.

802
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,432
I'm so sorry.

803
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:37,970
Anyway.

804
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:40,973
Anyway, Roxie Pagliani
did not kill Ali

805
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,501
or her husband in a
jealous fit of rage.

806
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,977
I mean, the woman's about as
passionate as a protein bar.

807
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,412
This has nothing to do
with passion.

808
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:49,115
The killer wants
my father's club.

809
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:51,150
Fletcher's?
How do you know that?

810
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,385
After I found Ali dead,

811
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:56,989
I noticed there was only one
thing missing from my apartment.

812
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,324
The pocket deed for Fletcher's.

813
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,226
Whoever possesses the deed
owns the club.

814
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,460
It was used as collateral

815
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,995
when my dad
borrowed money from Louie.

816
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:05,231
But when I went to confront him,

817
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:06,665
he was already dead.

818
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,268
Oh, that's why her hair
was at the crime scene.

819
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:11,938
So I thought, well, maybe Louie
told Roxie about the deed,

820
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,132
and she's the one
who got greedy.

821
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,440
Sadly, no.

822
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,242
Roxie was working
at the time of the murder.

823
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:19,245
But who else could've known
about that deed?

824
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,646
Well, not to worry.

825
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:24,150
There's a much faster way
to flush out the killer.

826
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,452
Candy's still my wife.
Legally, anyway.

827
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,354
Which would trump
any sort of deed.

828
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,989
Exactly, which means Fletcher's

829
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,391
now goes
to the grieving widower, me.

830
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,293
Yeah, but that makes you

831
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,461
the killer's next target.

832
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,997

895
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,693
This is...

896
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:57,196
it's pointless
cracking into this safe

897
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:58,697
because no matter what we find,

898
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,701
(it's not gonna change the fact
that A) there are things

899
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,537
about Lucifer that
I will never understand.

900
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,905
(And B)

901
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,609
Spackle's not gonna help
the Assyrian antique wall.

902
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:14,246
I think you and I both know
that this isn't about Spackle.

903
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,784
He left on my birthday.

904
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,287
And I wasn't
expecting a big party

905
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,389
or anything huge, maybe a card.

906
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:26,392
You know, Lucifer
is a nontraditional guy.

907
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,194
And he celebrates

908
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:31,530
in... nontraditional ways.

909
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,732
Right, like going to Vegas
with some radish.

910
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:34,526
Lucifer cares for you.

911
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,268
I'm sure he's gonna come back

912
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,804
with some crazy
explanation that...

913
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:42,174
That I'll probably never
hear about and that's fine.

914
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,376
It's fine.

915
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,912
I just hate that I sound jealous
'cause I'm not.

916
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,914
I'm not jealous.

917
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,449
I'm not, I just, um...

918
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,854
He's just my friend, you know?

919
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,390
I know.

920
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:00,359
What did I tell you?

921
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,393
I am the man.

922
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,731
Cheers.

923
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,933
To the weirdest birthday
I've ever had.

924
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:13,372
And thank you for the party,
such as it is.

925
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:38,397
Oh, dearie me.

926
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,665
Rough night, old boy?

927
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:44,236
I'm sorry, but-but this place...

928
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,571
is mine.

929
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:49,408
Well, well, well,
it seems our bad guy

930
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,443
is the good bartender.

931
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,245
You can forget the tip,

932
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:54,580
by the way.

933
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,480
First of all, excellent bluff,
Mr. Killer Bartender,

934
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:02,854
but I do need to tell you...

935
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,492
I do need to tell you...

936
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,730
What I was trying to tell you

937
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,365
before you
so rudely interrupted me

938
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,334
is that because
I know you're the killer

939
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,502
and you can't kill me,

940
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:18,304
you may as well just
hand yourself in now.

941
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:19,805
But I just shot you.
Yes, I know.

942
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,707
It's perplexing,
isn't it, Juddy?

943
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,509
Judd?

944
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,279
How could you?

945
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:29,047
Candy?

946
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,750
No, you-you can't be here. I...

947
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:32,718
I killed you!

948
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,321
What the hell is
happening to me?

949
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:37,523
Who are you talking to?

950
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:38,524
You can't see her?

951
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:39,525
Hmm?
But...

952
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:42,861
Oh, God.
What the hell?

953
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:45,531
Well, interesting turn
of phrase, actually, Juddy,

954
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:46,865
because I am the Devil

955
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,501
and I believe that
you're being haunted.

956
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:51,403
Perhaps if you repent your sins,

957
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:52,704
all will be forgiven.

958
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,406
The truth will set you free
and all that.

959
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,841
You were like
a son to my father,

960
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,543
a brother to me.

961
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,845
I was gambling again.
I was drowning in debt.

962
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,647
Why didn't you just tell me
you needed money?

963
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,649
Because you don't have any!

964
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:05,551
This place is worth crap.

965
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,085
It's the land that's
worth millions.

966
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,888
I tried to get your dad to sell
and I knew you wouldn't, either.

967
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,924
So, you shot me
in the back of the head.

968
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,460
Yes.

969
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:16,928
Yes, I did.

970
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,096
Now go away!

971
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,531
Oh! There we go, Juddy.

972
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:20,832
Leave me alone!

973
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,133
Fire away!

974
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,503
That's it. You're like a kid
in a candy store, aren't you?

975
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,405
That's it, Juddy, go on!

976
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,576
My leg!

977
00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:36,682
Excellent shot, Ms. Lopez.
Another hidden talent.

978
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,584
Thanks.

979
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:47,693
And don't worry, I'll give
you props for the arrest.

980
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:49,561
I'm cool like that.

981
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:51,497
Gee, thanks.

982
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,866
Hi.

983
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,438
I just wanted to say thank you
for saving my ass... again.

984
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:01,010
It's what any good husband
would've done.

985
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,411
Come on. Drinks
on the house.

986
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:07,446
Uh, much as I'd love to,

987
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:08,940
once Lola over there
finishes flirting,

988
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,082
we need to get
back to L.A.

989
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:13,519
Speaking of L.A.,

990
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,487
whatever happened
with the detective?

991
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:16,822
Mess it up yet?

992
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:20,592
Not yet, but I-I fear
I may be about to.

993
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:22,494
Then what the hell
are you still doing here?

994
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:23,729
Go home, you Devil.

995
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,731
Right.

996
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,800
You take care.

997
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:29,801
Yeah.
