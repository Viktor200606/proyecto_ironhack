<i>Wh-- Where did you go? Why...</i>

170
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,759
<i>Why are you not more tanned?</i>

171
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,136
<i>Listen, I'll catch you up on everything,</i>
<i>I promise,</i>

172
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,222
<i>-but, first, what's happening?</i>
<i>-Oh.</i>

173
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,057
<i>Yeah, of course. Um...</i>

174
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,854
<i>so our victim is a 55-year-old beekeeper</i>
<i>named Bob Goldbach. Cause of death...</i>

175
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,440
<i>[makes stabbing sound]</i>
<i>Honey scraper to the neck.</i>

176
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,400
<i>[Ella] Gnarly thing, right?</i>

177
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,819
<i>Who knew beekeeping was kind of badass?</i>

178
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,821
<i>It looks like one of the hives</i>
<i>was attacked.</i>

179
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:55,326
<i>So maybe Bob caught the killer</i>
<i>stomping on his poor bees and they fought?</i>

180
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,495
<i>Possibly. Any witnesses?</i>

181
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,705
<i>None.</i>
<i>But Bob's wife, Lenore, is over there.</i>

182
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,166
<i>Okay, great, thanks. I'll go talk to her.</i>

183
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,460
<i>-Good work, Ella.</i>
<i>-Sure.</i>

184
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,170
<i>[Ella, whispering] God...</i>

185
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,380
<i>Chloe's back.</i>

186
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,590
<i>We can finally get back to normal.</i>

187
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,304
<i>[Lenore sniffles]</i>
<i>No one hated Bob. He was a gentle soul.</i>

188
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,390
<i>He never even raised his voice.</i>

189
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,184
<i>And you can't think of anybody</i>
<i>who may have wanted to hurt him?</i>

190
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,394
<i>I can't.</i>

191
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,062
<i>I mean, we...</i>

192
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,648
<i>We sell honey</i>
<i>at the farmers' market together.</i>

193
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,775
<i>It's just one big family over there.</i>

194
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,986
<i>[Chloe] All right...</i>

195
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,196
<i>I'm... right in the middle of something.</i>

196
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,240
<i>So, go on.</i>

197
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,033
<i>[Lenore] I, um...</i>

198
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,412
<i>I can't imagine...</i>

199
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,374
<i>I'm so sorry, excuse me.</i>

200
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,002
<i>Could I speak with you?</i>

201
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,425
<i>Lucifer, her husband was just murdered.</i>

202
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,634
<i>Are you...</i>

203
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,928
<i>okay?</i>

204
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,389
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

205
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,599
<i>Where did you go?</i>

206
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,644
<i>Oh, uh, I took Trixie to Europe</i>
<i>and we traveled around and...</i>

207
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,896
<i>you know, it gave me time to...</i>

208
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,274
<i>to process what I saw.</i>

209
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,775
<i>And...</i>

210
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,485
<i>have you processed?</i>

211
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,195
<i>Are-- Are you...</i>

212
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,448
<i>okay with what you saw?</i>

213
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,074
<i>-I--</i>
<i>-Detective...</i>

214
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,493
<i>are you okay with me?</i>

215
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,747
<i>It's not like you haven't always</i>
<i>told me the truth.</i>

216
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,248
<i>You know?</i>

217
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,875
<i>So...</i>

218
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,002
<i>I think, deep down, I just...</i>

219
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,920
<i>I always knew.</i>

220
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,464
<i>But how does it make you feel?</i>

221
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,883
<i>Afraid? Terrified?</i>
<i>Do you want to yell at me?</i>

222
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,260
<i>Punch me in the face? Run away again?</i>

223
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,678
<i>[Chloe] I...</i>

224
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,847
<i>I think I just want to get back to work.</i>

225
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,223
<i>That's all?</i>

226
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:42,975
<i>That's all.</i>

227
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,193
<i>What the f...</i>

228
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,278
<i>[theme music playing]</i>

229
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,122
<i>I'm glad I've come to talk to you</i>
<i>all these years, Linda.</i>

230
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:09,335
<i>You've opened my eyes,</i>
<i>helped me understand how emotions work.</i>

231
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,462
<i>Thank you, Lucifer. That's...</i>

232
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,297
<i>wonderful to hear.</i>

233
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:18,010
<i>Once again, your insight</i>
<i>has helped me come to a realization.</i>

234
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,806
<i>The Detective is clearly in denial.</i>

235
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,807
{\an8}<i>Ah.</i>

236
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,892
{\an8}<i>Of course.</i>

237
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,938
{\an8}<i>How else to explain</i>
<i>her complete non-reaction to my true self?</i>

238
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,439
<i>Help me, Doctor.</i>

239
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,191
<i>Help me help her.</i>

240
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,862
<i>-Well, what did you want to hear from her?</i>
<i>-What I want isn't important.</i>

241
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,988
<i>I disagree.</i>

242
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,491
{\an8}<i>What Chloe is going through is...</i>

243
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,787
{\an8}<i>incredibly difficult.</i>

244
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,956
<i>Trust me, I know from experience.</i>

245
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,625
<i>But I'm </i><span style="style1">{\an8}your</i><i> therapist.</i>

246
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,585
{\an8}<i>Not hers.</i>

247
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,214
{\an8}<i>And I wonder if whether you expected</i>

248
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,216
{\an8}<i>her to reject you.</i>

249
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,885
{\an8}<i>Maybe even wanted her to.</i>

250
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,012
{\an8}<i>Well, why on earth</i>
<i>would I want her to reject me?</i>

251
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,641
{\an8}<i>Because your Devil face has returned</i>
<i>and you've refused to talk about it.</i>

252
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,435
{\an8}<i>[sighs, scoffs]</i>

253
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,147
{\an8}<i>There's not much to say, really.</i>

254
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,066
{\an8}<i>I killed a human for the first time,</i>
<i>my Devil face returned.</i>

255
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,402
<i>I don't think it's as simple as that.</i>

256
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,613
<i>Killing a human is against</i>
<i>your father's rules, not your own.</i>

257
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,117
{\an8}<i>And you've recently learned</i>
<i>that angels self-actualize.</i>

258
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,410
{\an8}<i>So you think...</i>

259
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,037
{\an8}<i>that I'm punishing myself</i>
<i>for killing a human?</i>

260
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,706
{\an8}<i>I'm wondering if...</i>

261
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,584
{\an8}<i>you're punishing yourself for enjoying it.</i>

262
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,587
<i>[Lucifer scoffs]</i>

263
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,381
<i>So what if I did?</i>

264
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,594
{\an8}<i>Then perhaps that's why you see yourself</i>
<i>as evil again.</i>

265
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,765
{\an8}<i>And perhaps that's why</i>
<i>you want Chloe to reject you.</i>

266
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,433
<i>I don't want her to reject me.</i>

267
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,685
<i>She told you she's fine.</i>

268
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,980
{\an8}<i>What if what she told you is...</i>

269
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,733
{\an8}<i>actually simply the truth?</i>

270
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,359
<i>And what if it isn't?</i>

271
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,029
{\an8}<i>She'll find a way to let you know.</i>

272
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,908
<i>So you're saying I should just act</i>
<i>as if everything is as she claims...</i>

273
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,287
<i>then slowly poke at her denial</i>
<i>and find a way to pop the bubble.</i>

274
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:14,251
{\an8}<i>I know nothing I can say</i>
<i>is going to stop you from doing that.</i>

275
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,170
<i>But all I can ask is...</i>

276
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,631
<i>Take it slowly.</i>

277
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,383
{\an8}<i>[laughing] Of course, Doctor.</i>

278
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,719
{\an8}<i>Baby steps.</i>

279
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,472
<i>I'm the Devil.</i>

280
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,391
<i>[Chloe] Lucifer, what are you doing?</i>

281
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,102
<i>Detective, it's time Miss Lopez</i>
<i>finally knew the truth.</i>

282
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,357
<i>[Lucifer] I am the angel who led</i>
<i>a rebellion against my father, God.</i>

283
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,776
<i>I was banished to Hell afterwards,</i>

284
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,278
<i>where I ruled as king</i>
<i>over the souls of the damned.</i>

285
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,949
<i>Lucifer, it all makes sense now.</i>

286
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,541
{\an8}<i>Damn it, I tried to keep a straight face,</i>
<i>I really did.</i>

287
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,670
{\an8}<i>Man, how?</i>
<i>How do you stay in character like that?</i>

288
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,505
{\an8}<i>It's simple really. It's all true.</i>

289
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,049
<i>Oh, and my brother, Amenadiel,</i>
<i>he's an angel.</i>

290
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,844
<i>Ah, does he have wings?</i>

291
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,512
<i>-He does again actually.</i>
<i>-[both laugh]</i>

292
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,181
<i>-You think he can give me a ride?</i>
<i>-You should ask him.</i>

293
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,934
<i>-[Lucifer laughs]</i>
<i>-This guy. You're so funny!</i>

294
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,646
{\an8}<i>Ah! Why would you think that I'm not</i>
<i>telling the truth, Miss Lopez?</i>

295
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,523
{\an8}<i>I stopped trying to figure that out</i>
<i>years ago.</i>

296
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,693
{\an8}<i>I mean, hey, we all got our quirks, right?</i>

297
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,778
<i>Mine is that I'm, like,</i>
<i>actually the Devil.</i>

298
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,113
<i>-Oh, right!</i>
<i>-[Lucifer laughs]</i>

299
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,073
{\an8}<i>-[Chloe laughs]</i>
<i>-[Ella laughs]</i>

300
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,993
{\an8}<i>Oh, so do you have any new info</i>
<i>on the case?</i>

301
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,077
{\an8}<i>Uh, yes.</i>

302
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,829
{\an8}<i>So, it turns out</i>

303
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,582
{\an8}<i>the honey scraper couldn't have</i>
<i>belonged to the victim's collection,</i>

304
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,501
{\an8}<i>because it had, wait for it...</i>

305
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,045
{\an8}<i>honey on it.</i>

306
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,589
<i>And isn't that the point?</i>

307
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,216
<i>[Ella]</i>
<i>Bob and Lenore's specialty was varietals.</i>

308
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,469
{\an8}<i>You know, blueberry honey,</i>
<i>cinnamon honey. But this right here...</i>

309
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,055
{\an8}<i>good, old-fashioned plain honey, honey.</i>

310
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,016
{\an8}<i>So this honey came from somewhere else.</i>

311
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,935
{\an8}<i>So maybe a rival came with his own tool</i>
<i>to destroy the hive.</i>

312
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,187
<i>And then used it to kill Bob</i>
<i>when he caught them.</i>

313
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,815
<i>How devilish. And I would know, after all.</i>

314
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:00,983
<i>You're the Devil.</i>

315
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,276
<i>[laughing] I really am.</i>

316
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,652
<i>[Ella laughs]</i>

317
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,945
<i>[clears throat] Right.</i>

318
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,698
<i>[Lucifer] Isn't this fun, Detective?</i>

319
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,657
<i>[Chloe] What's that?</i>

320
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,202
<i>Well, now you know the truth about me</i>
<i>and, as you said, fine with it...</i>

321
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,039
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>-Well, we can both be in on the joke.</i>

322
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:19,460
<i>You can watch humans twist themselves</i>
<i>into pretzels to justify what I tell them</i>

323
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,587
<i>instead of considering</i>
<i>the most obvious answer.</i>

324
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,924
<i>-[Chloe] I think it's kind of mean.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

325
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,761
<i>Well, no-one in their right mind</i>
<i>is going to believe</i>

326
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,096
<i>that you're actually, you know, the Devil.</i>

327
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,098
<i>-Oh.</i>
<i>-Well, without proof.</i>

328
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,518
<i>So of course they're going to try</i>
<i>and figure out the metaphor.</i>

329
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,605
<i>Or perhaps you're just smarting</i>
<i>from never figuring it out yourself.</i>

330
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>-[chuckles]</i>
<i>-Maybe a little bit.</i>

331
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,444
<i>So here's Bob and Lenore's stand.</i>
<i>They're newer to the farmers' market.</i>

332
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,906
<i>Whereas Pure Honey,</i>
<i>they've been here for years.</i>

333
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,909
<i>Maybe they didn't like the competition</i>
<i>moving in next door.</i>

334
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,120
<i>Destroy the rival hive</i>
<i>and suddenly he's back to being queen bee.</i>

335
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,668
<i>Detective, since you're clearly</i>
<i>comfortable with my devilishness...</i>

336
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,169
<i>-[chuckles]</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

337
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,004
<i>Care to see my mojo in action?</i>

338
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,756
<i>Sure. Why not?</i>

339
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,508
<i>Right.</i>

340
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,259
<i>Welcome.</i>

341
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,719
<i>What can I get for you?</i>

342
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,181
<i>Uh, LAPD, Detective Decker.</i>
<i>Do you own this stand?</i>

343
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,058
<i>Yeah. Glenn Dobbs.</i>

344
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,643
<i>Lovely. Tell me, Glenn...</i>

345
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,937
<i>what is it you desire?</i>

346
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,105
<i>Excuse me?</i>

347
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,315
<i>Well, I like to draw out</i>
<i>all those naughty,</i>

348
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,192
<i>hidden desires of humanity.</i>

349
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,655
<i>Though, you seem like someone</i>
<i>who really wants to unburden himself.</i>

350
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,781
<i>I...</i>

351
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,910
<i>[Glenn stammers] I...</i>

352
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,370
<i>I want...</i>

353
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,955
<i>-Go on. </i>
<i>-I...</i>

354
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,835
<i>Wait, w-what's happening?</i>

355
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,671
<i>Lucifer, you may want to...</i>

356
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,881
<i>Right, yes. Glenn...</i>

357
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,592
<i>Glenn, tell me...</i>

358
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,469
<i>what is it you desire?</i>

359
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,973
<i>I want Bob Goldbach to die.</i>

360
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,182
<i>Oh.</i>

361
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,228
<i>Case solved, Detective.</i>
<i>Here I was, worried we'd be rusty.</i>

362
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,732
<i>You want him to die? Why? Because</i>
<i>he was going to threaten your business?</i>

363
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,108
<i>What? No.</i>

364
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,695
<i>-It's because I'm terrified of him.</i>
<i>-[chuckles] You're terrified of Bob?</i>

365
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,822
<i>Chubby, harmless, and very dead Bob?</i>

366
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,948
<i>Bob's dead?</i>

367
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,074
<i>Very.</i>

368
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,618
<i>Oh, thank God. I can finally relax.</i>

369
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,162
<i>Why were you scared of Bob?</i>

370
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,789
<i>Let's talk in private.</i>

371
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,086
<i>[Glenn] Okay, fine.</i>

372
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,963
<i>I destroyed their beehive.</i>

373
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,300
<i>[Glenn] I was pissed</i>
<i>that Bob and Lenore's gimmicky honey</i>

374
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,135
<i>was putting my stand out of business.</i>

375
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,971
<i>I mean, avocado honey?</i>

376
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,473
<i>Come on.</i>

377
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,267
<i>I'm from LA</i>
<i>and even I think that's going too far.</i>

378
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,062
<i>But when Bob caught you,</i>
<i>you killed him, didn't you?</i>

379
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,730
<i>[Glenn] No, I went home,</i>

380
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,733
<i>and a couple of hours later,</i>
<i>Bob showed up at my front door.</i>

381
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,485
<i>So he confronted you. What did he say?</i>

382
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,402
<i>Say?</i>

383
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,321
<i>He didn't say anything.</i>

384
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,989
<i>[winces]</i>

385
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,533
<i>Bob did that to you?</i>

386
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,410
<i>It was like he was a different person.</i>

387
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,037
<i>He wasn't angry. He was...</i>

388
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,955
<i>He was so calm.</i>

389
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,541
<i>It made it even scarier, you know?</i>

390
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,085
<i>What did you do after he left?</i>

391
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,545
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>I went to the hospital.</i>

392
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,089
<i>Right. Show me again.</i>

393
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,177
<i>Detective, I have definitely</i>
<i>seen work like this before,</i>

394
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,095
<i>in Hell.</i>

395
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,679
<i>You know, where I'm...</i>

396
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,764
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

397
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,807
<i>Never mind.</i>

398
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,683
<i>A bag of billiard balls perhaps.</i>

399
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,435
<i>-Not quite round enough, is it?</i>
<i>-Ow!</i>

400
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,813
<i>It was doorknobs, of all things.</i>

401
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,232
<i>I mean, who does that?</i>

402
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,693
<i>[Chloe] Huh.</i>

403
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,989
<i>Well, his story checks out. Glenn was</i>
<i>at the hospital at the time of death.</i>

404
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,909
<i>Oh. So Bob wasn't as mild-mannered</i>
<i>as we first thought.</i>

405
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,452
<i>Hm. Apparently not.</i>

406
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,038
<i>But a bag of doorknobs? It's...</i>

407
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,748
<i>so specific.</i>

408
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,833
<i>Was it a message?</i>

409
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,293
<i>If so, it was lost on that poor chap.</i>

410
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,336
<i>Huh.</i>

411
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,924
<i>[Lucifer] What on earth are you doing?</i>

412
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,468
<i>[Chloe] I think we're being followed.</i>
<i>Looks like he's got a gun.</i>

413
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,769
<i>Detective, this is a chance</i>
<i>for me to use my devilish strength.</i>

414
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,437
<i>You can see what I'm truly capable of.</i>

415
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,773
<i>Or I can just point my gun at him</i>
<i>and yell, "Freeze!"</i>

416
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,983
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

417
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,819
<i>I've never really seen</i>
<i>how far I can actually throw a human.</i>

418
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,738
<i>-[sighs]</i>
<i>-Joking. Mostly.</i>

419
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,367
<i>Okay. He's all yours.</i>

420
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,287
<i>[man groans]</i>

421
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,997
<i>[choking]</i>

422
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,415
<i>Lucifer, stop!</i>

423
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,626
<i>I see you're not as comfortable</i>
<i>with my true nature as you claim.</i>

424
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,045
<i>What? No, it's not that. He's got a badge!</i>

425
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,214
<i>[man groans]</i>

426
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,466
<i>[man chokes]</i>

427
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,010
<i>Why were you following us?</i>

428
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,971
<i>Because your victim</i>
<i>was in witness protection.</i>

429
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,185
<i>US Marshal Luke Reynolds.</i>

430
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,479
<i>Hi.</i>

431
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,736
<i>You were Bob's handler?</i>

432
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,072
<i>I, uh, kept tabs on him,</i>
<i>made sure he was safe.</i>

433
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,826
<i>Failed pretty spectacularly</i>
<i>at that, though, didn't I?</i>

434
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,203
<i>You certainly did.</i>

435
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,455
<i>Well, he asked.</i>

436
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,582
<i>[Chloe]</i>
<i>So why were you following us outside?</i>

437
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,584
<i>You could have approached us at any time.</i>

438
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,378
<i>I know. Sorry, but when you're dealing</i>
<i>with someone like Bob the Knob--</i>

439
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,715
<i>[Lucifer snickers]</i>
<i>Sorry. Seriously? Bob the Knob?</i>

440
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,674
<i>[Lucifer laughs]</i>

441
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,135
<i>What was he in witness protection for?</i>
<i>Bad porn?</i>

442
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,138
<i>Bob was an enforcer</i>
<i>for the Paradiso crime syndicate.</i>

443
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,642
<i>His signature was beating people half </i>
<i>to death with a bag full of doorknobs.</i>

444
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,102
<i>Paradisos have a pretty ruthless</i>
<i>reputation.</i>

445
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:34,233
<i>I've never dealt with them myself, but</i>
<i>if Bob was high up in the organization...</i>

446
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,361
<i>They're based out of New York,</i>
<i>but have their fingers everywhere.</i>

447
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,988
<i>Look, no offense to the LAPD.</i>
<i>I just didn't know who to trust.</i>

448
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,574
<i>Especially since no-one</i>
<i>should've known Bob was here.</i>

449
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,327
<i>So you think</i>
<i>the Paradisos were responsible for this?</i>

450
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,329
<i>A group of them came to town</i>
<i>a couple of days ago</i>

451
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,039
<i>and I don't think it was</i>
<i>for the sunshine.</i>

452
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,083
<i>-Did you talk to them?</i>
<i>-What's the point?</i>

453
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,001
<i>They won't talk to law enforcement.</i>

454
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,211
<i>Oh, you'd be surprised.</i>

455
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,339
<i>I mean, after all,</i>
<i>she has the Devil at her side.</i>

456
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,969
<i>Maybe it is kind of fun being in the know.</i>

457
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,107
<i>[sighs]</i>

458
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,321
<i>[keys rattle]</i>

459
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,990
<i>-[Maze] What's up, Decker?</i>
<i>-[gasps]</i>

460
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,741
<i>Maze.</i>

461
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,203
<i>You scared me. What...</i>

462
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,290
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

463
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,166
<i>I heard you were back.</i>

464
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,004
<i>And I know that you know...</i>

465
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,339
<i>You know.</i>

466
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,507
<i>Right.</i>

467
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,176
<i>So you just hid in the dark and...</i>

468
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,888
<i>waited for the creepiest moment ever</i>
<i>to say something?</i>

469
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,223
<i>Old habits, I guess.</i>

470
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,438
<i>Look, I know you're probably</i>
<i>really freaked out, so...</i>

471
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,234
<i>Good faith gesture.</i>

472
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,738
<i>I'm locked into these.</i>
<i>You have nothing to worry about.</i>

473
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,240
<i>Look, I need you to know...</i>

474
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,701
<i>Chloe, that even though I'm a demon...</i>

475
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,997
<i>I would never hurt you.</i>

476
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,374
<i>I know.</i>

477
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,044
<i>Yeah?</i>

478
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,545
<i>Really.</i>

479
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,047
<i>Good.</i>

480
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,425
<i>Good faith, huh?</i>

481
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,053
<i>Well, you thought you were safe.</i>

482
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,680
<i>That's all that matters, right?</i>

483
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,639
<i>Is it?</i>

484
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,308
<i>So where's Trixie?</i>

485
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,186
<i>I was hoping to see her, too.</i>

486
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,646
<i>Oh, yeah. Uh...</i>

487
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,731
<i>She's at Dan's.</i>

488
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,692
<i>You know, obviously,</i>
<i>she hasn't seen him for a while,</i>

489
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,236
<i>so she's gonna stay with him for a bit.</i>

490
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,488
<i>Oh, yeah, sure.</i>

491
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,031
<i>I'll just swing by and say hi.</i>

492
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,032
<i>[Chloe] I don't--</i>

493
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,660
<i>I don't think that's a good idea, Maze.</i>

494
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,705

<i>Well, we both know why you're really here.</i>

00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,036
<i>Well, your wings are back.</i>

518
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,457
<i>You can finally go home for good,</i>

00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,425
<i>It's exactly as I remember.</i>

00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,844
<i>I'm happy for you, brother.</i>
<i>You're getting what you want.</i>

533
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,447

534
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,617

<i>My files say you and Bob hated each other.</i>

570
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,179
<i>We had a rivalry. He had his whole</i>
<i>doorknobs thing and, as for me--</i>

571
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,765
<i>You kill people in swimming pools,</i>

572

<i>It's very clever.</i>

<i>But as we got older,</i>

<i>Okay, say I believe that.</i>

576
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,360
<i>Bob still put your uncle in jail</i>
<i>for 50 years because he testified.</i>

577

<i>Yeah, and we owe him for that.</i>

<i>-What do you mean?</i>
<i>-Uncle Vin was a bastard.</i>

<i>And as for the honey, </i>

<i>A couple weeks ago,</i>

<i>We came here to warn him.</i>
<i>That's when we tried the honey.</i>

<i>Almost as sweet as that Lenore of his.</i>

586
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,592
<i>Can I see the note?</i>

587
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,218
<i>Wish I could help you.</i>

588
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,637
<i>I gave it to Bob.</i>

<i>[Chloe] So I saw security cameras</i>
<i>at the farmers' market.</i>

<i>We can check the footage to see</i>
<i>if Pool Boy Paradiso or anybody else</i>

591

<i>visited Lenore and Bob's stand, okay?</i>

592
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,731
<i>Thanks, Dan.</i>

605
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:02,847
<i>Really?</i>

606
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,807
<i>His story tracks.</i>

607
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,394
<i>He has an alibi for the night of</i>
<i>the murder that completely checks out.</i>

608
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,437
<i>Alibis can be bought, or threatened.</i>

609
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,147
<i>These guys are monsters, Detective Decker.</i>

610
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,982
<i>And I'm not taking my eye off any of them,</i>

611
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,069
<i>but I believe him when he says</i>
<i>that he got an anonymous tip.</i>

612
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,947
<i>If the note exists,</i>
<i>whoever wrote it wanted Bob dead.</i>

613
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,115
<i>That's who we need to find.</i>

614
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,201
<i>Did Lenore know about Bob's past?</i>

615
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,412
<i>I don't know. I never met her.</i>

616
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,080
<i>Bob certainly wasn't</i>
<i>supposed to tell her,</i>

617
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,666
<i>but then again he wasn't supposed</i>
<i>to attack a honey bee farmer</i>

618
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,668
<i>with a bag full of doorknobs either, so...</i>

00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,593
<i>Lenore didn't seem to know</i>
<i>when I interviewed her, but Pool Boy...</i>

622
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,054
<i>He acted as if they had already met.</i>

623
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,848
<i>So she knew the truth.</i>

624
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,182
<i>Then maybe she saw the note.</i>

<i>You say something insulting,</i>
<i>stupid, but...</i>

<i>kind of funny, and I just shrug it off.</i>

633

638

<i>That they want you</i>
<i>as far away from them as possible,</i>

640
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,891
<i>because your very touch...</i>

641
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,559
<i>makes them recoil...</i>

00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,195
<i>We don't have the clown masks with us,</i>
<i>but I'm still game.</i>

659
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,947
<i>Okay. Well, If you were in denial,</i>

660
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,326
<i>and if that denial forced you</i>
<i>to face a truth that...</i>

661
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,956
<i>scared you</i>
<i>more than you'd like to admit...</i>

662
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,541
<i>Go on.</i>

663
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,001
<i>I'd say that you were</i>
<i>projecting your issues</i>

664
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,754
<i>onto whatever you were dealing with</i>
<i>in that moment.</i>

665
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,339
<i>Or...</i>

666
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,676
<i>whomever you were dealing with.</i>

667
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,593
<i>[sighs]</i>

668
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,513
<i>I see what you're saying, Doctor.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

669
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,557
<i>Do you?</i>

670
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,435
<i>Well, the Detective is clearly</i>
<i>projecting her issues onto the case.</i>

671
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,856
<i>So to understand her, I need to use the</i>
<i>case to help her understand her feelings.</i>

672
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,649
<i>And in so doing,</i>

673
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,068
<i>understand your own feelings as well?</i>

674
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,863
<i>[Lucifer scoffs]</i>

675
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,871
<i>Hey, Dan, I've been meaning to say,</i>

676
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,164
<i>you know, I... I'm sorry</i>
<i>that I wasn't here for you</i>

677
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,708
<i>when you were dealing with...</i>

678
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,876
<i>well, everything.</i>

679
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,253
<i>[Dan] I don't know how much</i>
<i>of a difference it'd have made.</i>

680
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,088
<i>I just threw myself into work, you know?</i>

681
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,424
<i>[Chloe] No, but still, now I'm here</i>
<i>to pick up the slack,</i>

682
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,509
<i>so if you want to,</i>
<i>take some time off to mourn.</i>

683
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:30,013
<i>The job is kind of like my therapy.</i>
<i>It's exactly where I need to be right now.</i>

684
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,348
<i>Okay, but you know, I'm here to talk.</i>

685
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,308
<i>Look, I know.</i>

686
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,727
<i>And thank you.</i>

687
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,314
<i>There is something, though.</i>

688
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,356
<i>What's up?</i>

689
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,234
<i>What's Trixie's obsession with gelato?</i>

690
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,611
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

691
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,488
<i>It was hard getting her to leave Rome</i>
<i>after she discovered that stuff.</i>

692
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,990
<i>[suspenseful music playing]</i>

693
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,394
<i>Okay, so the neighbor saw Lenore leave</i>
<i>carrying a gym bag,</i>

694
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,188
<i>alone and in a hurry.</i>
<i>She took her own car.</i>

695
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,066
<i>So what? She was involved</i>
<i>in her husband's murder and then ran?</i>

696
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,901
<i>She could have written the anonymous note.</i>

697
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,821
<i>When it didn't work, maybe she killed him</i>
<i>herself or found someone else to do it.</i>

698
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,532
<i>[Lucifer] Or she found out the truth</i>
<i>about the man she loved</i>

699
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,742
<i>and it drove her away.</i>

700
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,037
<i>What do you think she would have felt</i>
<i>in that moment? Horror? Disgust?</i>

701
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,246
<i>Mild arousal?</i>

702
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,666
<i>I don't think that's really helping</i>
<i>right now, Lucifer.</i>

703
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,919
<i>Understanding her perspective will help us</i>
<i>understand her actions, Detective.</i>

704
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,339
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>You know, that's a good point.</i>

705
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,008
<i>I'm sure she felt betrayed...</i>

706
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,719
<i>Confused. Scared, even.</i>

707
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,889
<i>Is that why you think she ran?</i>
<i>Because she was afraid of him?</i>

708
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,267
<i>Lenore may have lied</i>
<i>about what she knew about Bob,</i>

709
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,353
<i>but she was genuinely grief-stricken</i>
<i>at the crime scene.</i>

710
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,230
<i>So I think we're missing something.</i>

711
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,523
<i>Ella, what did she leave with?</i>

712
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:07,360
<i>Clothes, toiletries. Your standard</i>
<i>get-the-hell-out-of-town go bag.</i>

713
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,611
<i>Oh, and...</i>

714
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,780
<i>her wedding album.</i>

715
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,575
<i>You don't take a wedding album</i>
<i>if you've murdered your husband.</i>

716
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,620
<i>[Chloe] Dan, what did you see</i>
<i>on the farmers' market footage?</i>

717
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,498
<i>Just one visit from Pool Boy Paradiso,</i>
<i>like he claimed.</i>

718
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,959
<i>Oh, and Marshal Reynolds.</i>
<i>A couple of times, actually.</i>

719
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,670
<i>And was it only Bob</i>
<i>that Reynolds was talking to?</i>

720
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,839
<i>Well, he spoke to Lenore once. Why?</i>

721
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,507
<i>Well, he said that they had never met.</i>

722
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,305
<i>I don't-- I'm fine.</i>
<i>Whatever. It doesn't matter.</i>

723
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,850
<i>[Linda]</i>
<i>Maze, you and I both know that's not true.</i>

724
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,935
<i>Trixie means a lot to you.</i>

725
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,229
<i>And she's the last person</i>
<i>you need to make up with</i>

726
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,690
<i>since your backslide into demon-dom.</i>

727
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,649
<i>I'm...</i>

728
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,277
<i>Okay, Linda, what is going on with you?</i>

729
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,029
<i>Do you need to pee or something?</i>

730
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,615
<i>No. I sit all day. It's nice to be able</i>
<i>to move around when I get a chance.</i>

731
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,409
<i>Okay.</i>

732
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,911
<i>So let's talk about</i>
<i>what you're dealing with emotionally.</i>

733
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,705
<i>Yeah, I really don't want to.</i>

734
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,957
<i>Maybe it would help</i>
<i>if I spoke your language.</i>

735
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,000
<i>You speak Lilim?</i>

736
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:09,130
<i>[speaking in Lilim in a deep voice]</i>

737
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:10,798
<i>What?</i>

738
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,925
<i>No, guess not.</i>

739
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,219
<i>No, I'm talking about violence.</i>

740
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,429
<i>Come on, stand up.</i>

741
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,597
<i>Okay.</i>

742
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,933
<i>One, I like to fight when I'm happy or...</i>

743
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,435
<i>horny.</i>

744
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:26,981
<i>And, two, I really don't want</i>
<i>to accidentally kill my best friend.</i>

745
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,609
<i>No. Well, I think you</i>
<i>underestimate me, Maze.</i>

746
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,944
<i>Uh, I've been doing some kickboxing.</i>

747
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,945
<i>I've got moves.</i>

748
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:34,989
<i>Um...</i>

749
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,700
<i>I'll let you take a free--</i>

750
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,868
<i>Hey!</i>

751
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,454
<i>-Linda!</i>
<i>-Stop it, you two.</i>

752
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:42,872
<i>It's good I'm here.</i>

753
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,416
<i>I can't allow you guys to fight over me</i>
<i>any longer.</i>

754
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,710
<i>-Uh...</i>
<i>-Oh...</i>

755
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,088
<i>Ah, you're not fighting over me,</i>

756
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,506
<i>are you?</i>

757
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,343
<i>No, but it's sweet of you to think so.</i>

758
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,469
<i>[Linda chuckles]</i>

759
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,471
<i>We made up a month or so ago.</i>

760
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,307
<i>So do you need my help?</i>

761
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,184
<i>With this or...</i>

762
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,521
<i>anything else?</i>

763
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:07,980
<i>No, we're good.</i>

764
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,190
<i>[Maze] We're good.</i>

765
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,360
<i>[Linda] Are you okay?</i>

766
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,279
<i>I went back home to the Silver City.</i>

767
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,074
<i>That's amazing.</i>

768
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,827
<i>It should be.</i>
<i>It's exactly as I remembered it, but...</i>

769
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,081
<i>Why did it feel so...</i>

770
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,542
<i>different?</i>

771
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,169
<i>Why didn't it feel like...</i>

772
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:31,879
<i>Like home?</i>

773
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:34,966
<i>[sighs]</i>

774
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,176
<i>Because this is your home.</i>

775
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,057
<i>[Chloe] Ugh.</i>

776
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,184
<i>I'm just getting Reynolds' voicemail.</i>

777
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,186
<i>Any luck tracing his phone?</i>

778
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,023
<i>I'm triangulating it now.</i>
<i>Not sure how long it'll take, though.</i>

779
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,109
<i>Or whether or not</i>
<i>he had anything to do with this.</i>

780
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,946
<i>I think he did. I made a couple</i>
<i>of discreet calls to the Marshals' office.</i>

781
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,198
<i>Two of the ex-cons under</i>
<i>Reynolds' protection</i>

782
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,741
<i>have died in the last couple years.</i>

783
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,285
<i>-Who killed them?</i>
<i>-That's it.</i>

784
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,744
<i>One was an angry girlfriend.</i>

785
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,414
<i>The other was a hit and run</i>
<i>that looked like it was mob-related.</i>

786
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,750
<i>So our dear Marshal weaponized</i>
<i>the very secrets only he knew.</i>

787
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,879
<i>He let certain enemies know</i>
<i>where the criminals were hiding.</i>

788
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,882
<i>Or told the new wives the truth,</i>
<i>knowing how betrayed they'd feel.</i>

789
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,050
<i>And voila, the dirty work</i>
<i>was done for him.</i>

790
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,427
<i>That is remarkably efficient.</i>

791
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,345
<i>But in Bob's case, nobody took the bait.</i>

792
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,600
<i>So maybe Reynolds got frustrated</i>
<i>and decided to get his own hands dirty?</i>

793
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,601
<i>The question is, why?</i>

794
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,103
<i>I'll keep digging, see if I can find more.</i>

795
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,275
<i>So, why did Lenore run?</i>

796
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,652
<i>Well, if Reynolds met with her</i>
<i>previously...</i>

797
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,779
<i>then probably she trusts him.</i>

798
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,617
<i>So maybe he reached out to her</i>
<i>to tell her she was in danger.</i>

799
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,911
<i>Oh, and little did she know</i>
<i>how true that was.</i>

800
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,539
<i>Just got a hit on Reynolds' GPS, so,</i>
<i>you know, it might be a good idea to...</i>

801
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,001
<i>[whispers] You guys got this.</i>

802
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,344
<i>[whimpering] Why?</i>

803
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,762
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

804
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:04,847
<i>Please...</i>

805
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,767
<i>[sobbing] Please tell me. Don't! Don't.</i>

806
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,684
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

807
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,312
<i>-There's no other way.</i>
<i>-Please, don't.</i>

808
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,730
<i>[Lucifer] Sure there is!</i>

809
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,524
<i>There are loads of ways to kill her.</i>
<i>Literally tons.</i>

810
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,612
<i>But you chose to use</i>
<i>Frank "Pool Boy" Paradiso's MO</i>

811
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,530
<i>to frame him and tie up loose ends.</i>

812
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:22,990
<i>It's very clever.</i>

813
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,368
<i>[Chloe] Drop the gun, Reynolds. Step away.</i>

814
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,870
<i>You don't understand.</i>
<i>I'm not the bad guy here.</i>

815
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,373
<i>I've watched all these criminals</i>
<i>for years,</i>

816
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:34,669
<i>living happy lives, being rewarded</i>
<i>for the terrible things that they did.</i>

817
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,421
<i>Lenore's done nothing wrong. Let her go.</i>

818
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,007
<i>Oh, hasn't she? She forgave him.</i>
