Previously on Lucifer...

00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:04,413
So, we're still good
to be roomies, right?

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:05,656
What are you talking about, roomies?

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,768
We shook on it.

5
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:09,220
You shall remain right here,

00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:11,222
on Earth, amongst the creatures

7
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:12,223
you so despise.

00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:13,808
Existing in this punishment

allows me to be closer to my family.

10
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,146
You made a deal to return Mom to Hell.

11
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:21,065
In exchange, Chloe's life was spared.

12
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:22,400
You still haven't delivered

13
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:23,568
on your end of the bargain.

14
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:24,702
If you're so concerned,

15
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:26,571
why don't you just fly Mum back to Hell?

chance that your car accident

was a result of my father
trying to send me a message.

- What?
- Living with Maze.

00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,088
Potential for sexy pillow
fights notwithstanding,

70
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:43,758
you and Maze are like
snow pants and elephants.

71
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,427
- You don't mix.
- Maze and I

72
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:48,596
have become friends.

73
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,131
Sort of.

And I think it's gonna be fine.

Oh, really?

00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,233

have to get to school.

And besides, that's your bedtime story.

88
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:14,956
I'll read that to you tonight.

00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,575

ingesting millions of dollars'

00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,278
all right, but, uh, we'll
need to be discreet about it,

166

174

why do you like this
Wesley Cabot guy so much?

175
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:07,545
Well, he rips men's hearts out,

176

wipes out entire villages,

177
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:10,131
never says thank you,

178
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:11,632
and he's applauded for it.

179
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:14,752
Oh, him... as opposed to you.

180
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:16,220
That's right, because you're the

181
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,221
(whispering): son of God.

182
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:18,222
- Exactly.
- (clicks tongue)

183
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:19,473
- Yes.
- I get it.

184
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,392
I mean, Stanislavksy would
be very proud of you.

185
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:24,428
Okay, for the last time,
I am not a method actor.

186
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,813
So method of you to say.

187
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:26,764
Damn, you are good.

188
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:28,766
Hey, can you cry on cue?

189
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,103
Sorry, excuse me.

190
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:35,022
(horn honking)

191
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,622
MAN: Hello, brother.

192
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,257
LUCIFER: Ah.

193
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,875
Uriel!

194
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,377
I thought it was you.

195
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:58,429
Welcome to Earth.

196
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:00,848
Clearly, I got the fashion
sense in the family.

197
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,600
Word of advice: I'd
lose the trench coat,

198
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:03,634
'cause as it stands,

199
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:05,353
it's less cool, brooding angel,

200
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:06,687
more sort of "pedophile chic."

201
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,973
- One joke down. One to go.
- (chuckles)

202
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,142
Why can't you take anything
seriously, Lucifer?

203
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:12,143
What do they say?

204
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:13,644
Laugh like no one's listening?

205
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:15,146
Dance like you're
standing on the corpses

206
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,147
of your enemies?

207
00:07:16,232 --> 00:07:17,898
And there's the other.

208
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,483
Predictable as ever.

209
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,035
What do you want, Uriel?

210
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,153
I came to you tell you

211
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:23,988
that you have 24 hours.

212
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:26,657
I'll bite. 24 hours or what?

213
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,326
Either return here with Mom,

214
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:31,162
or I'll finish what I started
with your detective.

215
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:34,799
The car accident.

216
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:35,883
You made a deal with Dad.

217
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:38,669
Time to pay up. So...

218
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:40,671
bring Mom to me,

219
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,638
or I'll take back what Dad gave you.

220
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:55,218

221
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:03,333
Uriel is here?

222
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,242
Pleasant aroma and all.

223
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:06,790
And he's after Chloe?

224
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,791
MAZE: No.

225
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:09,242
He's after Chloe

226
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:11,878
or that classy bitch you call "Mom."

227
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:13,617
You made a deal with Daddy.

228
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:14,743
Time to pay up.

229
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,877
- (scoffs)
- Uriel can come after

230
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,579
celestial beings like us, yes,

231
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,164
but angels aren't
allowed to kill humans.

232
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,716
- Chloe should be safe.
- Yes,

233
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:21,750
but remember, dear brother,

234
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,752
that Uriel can play with patterns.

235
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,337
He makes a butterfly flap its wings

236
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,256
and a housewife gets chlamydia.

237
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,176
Or Chloe gets into a seemingly
accidental car wreck.

238
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,011
Correct, for ten points.

239
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,346
Well, too bad there isn't an easy way

240
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:35,897
to make this all go away.

241
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,150
Oh, wait, there is.

242
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,851
Send your mom back to Hell.

243
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:40,685
- (chuckles)
- A solution

244
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:41,737
which you

245
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,522
will, no doubt, avoid.

246
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,440
Well, worry not, my
little sex thug, because

247
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,659
Uriel won't be a problem.

248
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,077
We have a nuclear weapon.

249
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,113
What's that?

250
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,414
You.

251
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,032
Well, Uriel doesn't know that

252
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:55,333
we're working together on this.

253
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,752
We all know he won't listen to me.

254
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,538
But he will if it's someone
from the home team.

255
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,257
So, you will go and convince him

256
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,759
that he needs to go back.

257
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,378
Or, you know, just punch
him in his smug face.

258
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,596
Dealer's choice.

259
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,680
(chuckling)

260
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,048
God, it's nice

261
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,217
having a super powerful angel
on your side, isn't it?

262
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,687
Good luck with that.

263
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,026
CHLOE: Huh.

264
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,394
Saved your life.

265
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,312
(chuckling): Maybe. You never know.

266
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,397
What are you talking about?

267
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,398
Well, it appears

268
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,616
that I was correct this morning.

269
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,402
You are being targeted by cosmic forces.

270
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,453
But fear not,

271
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,737
it's all being dealt with.

272
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,789
And I'm here.

273
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,707
CHLOE: Now...

274
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,075
what is with everyone

275
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,410
and this car accident? I'm fine.

276
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,628
No, I'm afraid that you're not.

277
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,379
And so, for the next day or so,

278
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,582
I'm gonna need you to be unpredictable.

279
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,217
Whatever you'd normally
do, just, you know...

280
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,918
ah, ah... do the opposite.

281
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,170
Too bad.

282
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,921
I was totally gonna have
sex with you today.

283
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:52,390
Really?

284
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,227
Oh. Well played, Detective. (chuckles)

285
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,596
Yes, but until the threat has passed,

286
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:58,814
just to be safe,

287
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,098
I won't be leaving your side.

288
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,733
So just think of me

289
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,485
as your Guardian Devil.

290
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,270
(softly): Okay.

291
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,271
Guys, Wesley Cabot's dead.

292
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:07,439
I can't believe it.

293
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,990
Oh, God. Not you, too.

294
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,276
Oh, man. Body Bags 1 through 6.

295
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:13,111
First in line. I mean,
I even skipped out

296
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,413
on some of our wedding planning
to see Body Bags 6. Remember?

297
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,832
That was the big emergency?

298
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,783
It was totally worth it.
It was a great movie.

299
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:20,452
Yes, it was. Better catch
phrase, wasn't it?

300
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:21,786
BOTH: "Not on my watch."

301
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:22,787
(both chuckling)

302
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,206
Maybe I should get a catch phrase.

303
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,124
You don't need a catch phrase. And you.

304
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,126
Do you have anything
constructive to add?

305
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:30,795
Uh, yep. Yep, I do.

306
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,465
The boy who, uh, found the body

307
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:35,967
remembered the first three plate
numbers of the getaway car.

308
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,435
13 matches.

309
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,854
13. That's a lot of legwork.

310
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,472
Jamie Lee Adrienne.

311
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,107
The, uh, the Playmate?

312
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,275
- The ex-party girl?
- Yeah.

313
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,726
What does she have to
do with Wesley Cabot?

314
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,978
She's his ex-wife. They met
on the set of Body Bags 4.

315
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,780
Apparently, Jamie and
Wesley's divorce proceedings

316
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,282
were very contentious.

317
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,651
Maybe she went to "renegotiate."

318
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,202
(Lucifer and Dan chuckling)

319
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:55,787
By "renegotiate", I mean kill him.

320
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,656
- Yeah.
- Uh...

321
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,041
Yeah.

322
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,713
I can't believe Wesley's really gone.

323
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,665
When was the last time you saw Mr.
Cabot?

324
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,885
Um... a few weeks ago.

325
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,886
Maybe.

326
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,254
Interesting.

327
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,056
Then can you explain why a
witness said that they saw you

328
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,342
speeding away from Wesley's
dojo this morning?

329
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:20,896
Welcome to Devil Time.

330
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,514
- What are you doing?
- Trying out my new catch phrase.

331
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,765
"Welcome to Devil Time"?

332
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,183
- What the hell does that mean?
- She knows what it means.

333
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,568
I have no idea what that means.

334
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,070
- Oh.
- Okay, yeah. I...

335
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,739
I was at the dojo this morning.

336
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,691
But it's not what you think.

337
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:35,026
I went because of this...

338
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,411
WESLEY (on voice mail):
My life is destroyed.

339
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,079
And it all started with Body Bags 4.

340
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,331
Call me back.

341
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,950
What "started with Body Bags 4"?

342
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,201
I have no idea.

343
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:45,003
That's why I went to go see see Wesley.

344
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,706
But he was already dead and...

345
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:50,041
I panicked and then I ran...

346
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:51,376
But I swear

347
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,761
I would've never hurt Wesley.

348
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:56,047
Even though we were divorced,
I really cared about him.

349
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:57,882
Where were you at 7:00 a.m.
this morning?

350
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,551
With Raphael.

351
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,769
My Pilates instructor.

352
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,221
And how does the Weaponizer
feel about all this?

353
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,807
(whispering): Who the
hell is the Weaponizer?

354
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,776
He's a character played
by Kimo Van Zandt,

355
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,311
Wesley's co-star

356
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,863
and her current husband.

357
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,282
So you used to be married
to an action star,

358
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:16,234
only to divorce him and marry

359
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:18,119
another action star?

360
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,038
Yeah. It was the '90s.

361
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,456
We did a lot of coke.

362
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,074
Well, how did your current husband feel

363
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,409
about you visiting your ex?

364
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,460
Oh, that's easy.

365
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,128
Kimo and Wesley hated each other.

366
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,246
Long-standing feud.

367
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:29,798
God only knows what Kimo would've done

368
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,249
if he knew I went to see him.

369
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,751
Where was Kimo this morning?

370
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:36,171
Uh, at ActionCon in Reno.

371
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,555
Signing autographs.

372
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,057
WESLEY: Where's my money, partner?

373
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,476
I will end you!

374
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,645
Without Body Bags 4,
you are nothing, man!

375
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,564
How does Body Bags 4
figure into all this?

376
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,401
Well, Wesley, our victim, uh,

377
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,353
was the hero of the Body Bags franchise.

378
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,487
Ooh, and in Body Bags 4,

379
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:53,905
newcomer Kimo Van Zandt appeared.

380
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,607
He played this shady CIA operative,

381
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,941
who acted as Wesley's foil

382
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:58,443
and his eventual ambiguous ally, but...

383
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,412
Then Kimo's character got
spun off into his own,

384
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,164
more successful franchise,
The Weaponizer.

385
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,116
Personal fave: Weaponizer
4: The Last Arsenal.

386
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,252
- So good, right?
- At the end, with the whole...

387
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,170

- Okay, I so regret asking you guys this.

388
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:12,007
Although, you're oddly adorable.

389
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,292
So, it seems like Kimo has always

390
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,427
had it out for Wesley.

391
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,962
Stole his wife, stole
his film franchise.

392
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,798
So maybe he really did "end"
it for him once and for all.

393
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,016
But Kimo was in Reno.

394
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,884
At ActionCon.

395
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,520
But that convention happens
the last week in August.

396
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,605
- How do you know that?
- My mom used to go to it every year.

397
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,940
- So Jamie's lying.
- Or Kimo's lying to her.

398
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,692
Either way, we gotta find him.

399
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,811
- I'll put out a BOLO.
- Okay.

400
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:35,780
MOM: Please, hold on. Um...

401
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,651
Again, I apologize that the
children were late for school.

402
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,037
And, yes, I understand

403
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:45,790
that pants need to be
worn every day, now.

00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,333
Ooh!

407
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:57,669
Rough day?

408
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:58,837
Oh...

409
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,222
Since returning to my
employment, I have found

410
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,476
the number of daily tasks to
be almost insurmountable.

411
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,678
But hey...

412
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,013
at least you're not here
to take me back to Hell.

413
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,020
You are here to take me back to Hell?

414
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:18,073
No, Mom, I'm not. I'm just...

415
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,408
Listen, I was just wondering
if your being here

416
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:22,694
is just postponing the inevitable.

417
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,364
I mean, at some point...

418
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,250
other siblings will come
down here looking for you.

419
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,202
And I'll convince them to let me stay,

420
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,921
just like I did you and Lucifer.

421
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,540
You were gone for a
really long time, Mom.

422
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,211
You might not know your children
as well as you think you do.

423
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,882
You may be right.

424
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:46,768
But, at least for now,

425
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,303

00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:04,429
(chuckles) Mr. Morningstar.

539
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:06,431
- Yes.
- Uh, Ryan Goldburg,

540
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:08,600
uh, Kimo's business manager.

541
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:10,935
I wanted to thank you
for making his bail.

542
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:13,306
Uh, you know, Kimo sure as
hell couldn't pay it himself.

543
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,157
Oh, it's the least I could do
for a true national treasure.

544
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:18,359
CHLOE: So, for someone with so
many hit movies under their belt,

545
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:19,611
why is he so broke?

546
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:22,113
Exotic cars. Private islands.

547
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:24,115
You know what costs more
than an albino tiger?

548
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:26,835
The upkeep on an albino tiger.

549
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,169
He blew through his money.

550
00:19:28,255 --> 00:19:29,204
Didn't listen.

551
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,122
And now there's no more coming in.

- Thanks again.
- Yes.

Such a tragedy.

554
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:37,345
Well, it's always a tragedy
when someone gets killed.

555
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,130
No, I'm talking about his tiger.

556

I would have bought it if I'd known.

Well, what's there to talk about?

562
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:02,821
Punch, taunt, punch, groin stomp.
Repeat.

563
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:04,656
Yeah, listen, Luci, I've been thinking,

564
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,492
there might be a better way to
handle this without violence.

565
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:08,607
What, like hugging him back to Heaven?

566
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:11,045
Like hiding Mom. Hiding Chloe.

567
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:11,996
And wait Uriel out.

568
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:14,499
- What?
- Look, just because he told us his plan

569
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:16,334
doesn't mean that's his plan.

570
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:17,502
It's Uriel.

571
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:20,004
It could be a trap.

572
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,224
Brother, you've been here too long.

573
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,009
It's changed you.

574
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:28,313
- What do you mean?
- Meaning that ever since

575
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:30,231
you've been here, you've
had to restrain yourself.

707
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:51,165

00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,598
because I cannot wait

716
00:26:07,683 --> 00:26:10,217
to hear how you sent Urinal packing.

717
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:13,053
(chuckles) And please
do not skimp on any

718
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,889
of the gory details.

719
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,560
MAZE: This would never have happened

720
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,729
if you'd listened to me earlier.

721
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:27,568
(scoffs) How is this possible, brother?

722
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,907
I no longer have my powers.

723
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,326
Well, what happened to them?
Oh, I don't know, Luci,

724
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:36,577
pick a sin.

725
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,913
Is it because I released
a damned soul from Hell?

726
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,749
Slept with a demon? Is it
because I'm working with you?

727
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,584
Or because of Mom?

728
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:48,756
Or am I simply no longer worthy?

729
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:51,425
(sniffles)

730
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:54,511
It's time that I faced
the truth, brother.

731
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:59,266
I've fallen.

732
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,356
Well.

733
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:07,608
Welcome to the club.
Meetings are on Tuesdays.

734
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,860
It's different for me, Luci.

735
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:11,362
It's different.

736
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:13,747
I no longer have my powers.

737
00:27:13,783 --> 00:27:15,199
My very strength...

738
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:16,667
Big deal!

739
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:19,620
It's probably the best thing
that ever happened to you.

740
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:22,590
But right now I haven't got
time to hold your hand,

741
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,959
because I need to clear up your mess!

742
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:27,127
- My mess?
- Uriel's still out there.

743
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,712
And the clock is up...

744
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:31,298
which means the detective
is in grave danger.

What are you doing here?

789
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:32,592
I could ask you two the same thing.

790
00:29:32,678 --> 00:29:34,427
Uh, we're just having
a business meeting.

791
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:35,595
- Yeah.
- Mm.

792
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:37,097
You make out with all your clients?

793
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:38,732
What's the occasion? You celebrating

794
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:41,851
the successful theft of Wesley
and Kimo's merchandising money?

795
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:44,404
I would never steal from my clients.

796
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:46,940
Oh, you are clever, Ryan.

797
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:49,025
- What is she talking about, Ryan?
- What I'm talking about

798
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:50,410
is how Wesley realized

799
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:52,862
his action figures were
selling like hotcakes,

800
00:29:52,914 --> 00:29:54,531
did some investigating,

801
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,333
and saw that he was getting robbed.

802
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:58,084
- I think you should go.
- Unfortunately for Wesley,

803
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,453
he shared his concerns
about his business manager

804
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,373
with his ex-wife, who happened
to be sleeping with him.

805
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,375
And that voice mail
that you played for us,

806
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,677
that's what started this, and
that's what got him killed.

807
00:30:10,215 --> 00:30:11,348
He did it!

808
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:12,432
He's the one

809
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:13,883
- who killed Wesley!
- What?!

810
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:15,218
No, it was her idea!

811
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,103
It was her idea to switch
out the Nunchuck Award,

812
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:18,104
cover it in blood...

813
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,938
Don't shoot!

814
00:30:19,024 --> 00:30:20,807
KIMO: You stole from me,

815
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:21,941
killed Wesley,

816
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,694
then you tried to frame me for it?!

817
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,447
- Kimo...
- I cared about both of you!

818
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:29,366
(screams) No, please!

819
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:30,533
Kimo...

820
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:32,202
put the gun down. Please.

821
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:34,120
They murdered Wesley.

822
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:36,956
And they will pay for
that, I promise you.

823
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:40,160
But don't let them ruin your
life, too, Kimo. Please.

824
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:41,411
My life is already ruined.

825
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:42,662
Get out of the way.

826
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:43,713
No. I'll shoot you!

827
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:44,964
I don't care anymore!

828
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,216
LUCIFER: Kimo!

829
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:48,418
CHLOE: Lucifer, stay back.

830
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:49,669
Guys, stand down.

831
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:51,671
Detective, you don't know
what you're up against.

832
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:53,923
This was engineered to
put you in harm's way.

833
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:55,842
You must believe me.

834
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:56,926
Lucifer,

835
00:30:57,012 --> 00:30:59,979
I know exactly what I'm up against.

836
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:01,765
It's just a man...

837
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,817
who's in a lot of pain.

838
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:10,774
Kimo, a couple days ago

839
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:13,777
I was in a really bad car accident.

840
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:16,196
And I've spent the last few days

841
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:18,581
trying to convince everybody
that cares about me

842
00:31:18,617 --> 00:31:20,500
that it wasn't a big deal.

843
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:22,585
The truth is...

844
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:25,004
I'm terrified.

845
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,291
I'm scared of how it can all just end...

846
00:31:28,343 --> 00:31:29,793
with no rhyme or reason.

847
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:32,095
And what I want to do right now

848
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,130
is just go home

849
00:31:34,216 --> 00:31:36,349
and read a bedtime story to my daughter.

850
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:40,470
But... you know... that's
not up to me, either.

851
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:43,807
We can't control what happens to us,

852
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:47,310
only how it affects us
and the choices we make.

853
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:50,447
So, please.

854
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:53,783
Make the right choice, Kimo.

855
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,819
Please put down the gun.

856
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:06,463
(sirens wailing)

857
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:08,748
(exhales)

858
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,417
(whispering): Thank you.

859
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:16,089
Well, well done, Detective.

860
00:32:16,174 --> 00:32:17,841
Kimo was about to do a very bad thing.

861
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:19,976
Oh, well, not on my watch.

862
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:23,096
(chuckles) Very good.

863
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:25,014
Let me escort you back to the station.

864
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,934
No... I'm-I'm okay.

865
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:30,904
You know, I don't believe in fate.

866
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:33,490
And I don't believe in bad luck.

867
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:37,660
And I appreciate your
concern, but come what may.

868
00:32:37,696 --> 00:32:40,663
I am leaving here... alone.

869
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:43,249
Very well.

870
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:46,703
But just... buckle up,
Detective, please.

871
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:48,171
(sighs)

872
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:49,873
Right. Now, if you'll excuse me.

873
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:53,259

Chloe is safe,

892
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:39,589
and I don't have to clean
up your mess anymore.

893
00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:43,760
More importantly, you
get to keep your word.

00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:45,144
I am keeping my word.

895
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,764
You're serving out your
sentence here on Earth.

896
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:49,265
You know that's not what
your Father wanted.

897
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:50,600
Do I?!

898
00:33:50,685 --> 00:33:53,736
Everyone thinks they know what He wants.

899
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:57,273
Amenadiel did when he first
got here, now Uriel does.

900
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,076
Human wars have been
waged because of it.

901
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:02,195
Dad showed me

902
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,197
an open door.

903
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:06,249
Does that mean I was meant
to take you back to Hell

904
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:08,835
or was he insinuating that
Hell was getting drafty?

905
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,203
Nobody bloody knows,

906
00:34:10,288 --> 00:34:13,206
because the selfish bastard
won't just tell us!

907
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,292
And I'm sick of it.

908
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:17,877
No more.

909
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:20,880
No more.

910
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:24,350
There's my Lightbringer.

911
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:26,436
My Morningstar.

912
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:32,442
Uriel was so small when he was a child.

913
00:34:32,477 --> 00:34:35,778
All he ever wanted was to play
with you and the older kids.

914
00:34:35,814 --> 00:34:37,447
But you all excluded him.

915
00:34:37,482 --> 00:34:38,648
Yes.

916
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
And every time he came back,

917
00:34:40,785 --> 00:34:42,652
pestering us again.

918
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:44,621
Which is strange,

919
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,706
considering he knew what
the outcome would be.

920
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:50,493
That's how much he wanted
to be around you, Lucifer.

921
00:34:50,578 --> 00:34:53,329
Uriel is a stubborn boy.

922
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:55,048
When he sets his mind,

923
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,750
it doesn't waver.

924
00:34:57,836 --> 00:35:00,136
He's not going to give up until he has

925
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:02,138
either me or that detective.

926
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:03,923
Mum...

927
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:06,509
I refuse to believe that.

928
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:09,145
There is always another way.

929
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,399
If anyone can find it, it's you.

938

For a brief moment,

939
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:51,554
the pattern faltered.

940
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:54,107
I thought it meant you'd
actually bring Mom.

941
00:35:54,192 --> 00:35:56,893
That somehow, you'd surprise me.
'Cause for once in my life,

942
00:35:56,978 --> 00:35:58,945
I'd like to be surprised, but no.

943
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,731
No, here you are.

944
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:09,072
Are you done hiding behind
our big brother's skirt?

945
00:36:09,157 --> 00:36:10,623
(short chuckle)

946
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:12,375
Yes, it's just me now.

947
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:15,476
Big, bad Lucifer.

948
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,589
We've already had this
fight before, Lucifer.

949
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:25,992
Right here.

950
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:27,383
You see, in my head,

951
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:29,509
I've seen everything you do.

952
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:31,878
I've heard every dumb
quip you have to say.

953
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:33,179
Right, let me guess...

954
00:36:33,214 --> 00:36:34,881
in your version, I deliver Mom to you,

955
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:38,217
apologizing, tears
streaming down my face.

956
00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:39,886
Actually, no. In my version,

957
00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:41,604
you refuse to give Mom up

958
00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:44,023
and your human friend dies.

959
00:36:44,058 --> 00:36:45,525
Yes, you've tried that twice now.

960
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,809
Not much luck.

961
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:49,061
Maybe you're not as good
at this as you thought.

962
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:51,147
Maybe I'm building up to a big finale.

963
00:36:52,817 --> 00:36:54,734
All right.

964
00:36:54,786 --> 00:36:56,819
Uriel...

965
00:36:56,905 --> 00:36:59,405
you don't know what Dad wants.

966
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:01,290
None of us do.

967
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:03,576
- So I think...
- You're right.

968
00:37:03,628 --> 00:37:06,412
I don't know what Dad wants.
None of us do.

969
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:08,714
Right.

970
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,883
Great, well, I'm glad we had this talk.

971
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:13,085
I'll see you at the next family reunion.

972
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:14,420
I'll buy the first round.

973
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:16,506
But I do know what he needs.

974
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:20,092
Mom's out. It's only a matter of time

975
00:37:20,178 --> 00:37:21,844
before she finds her way back to Heaven,

976
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,596
and then he'll forgive her.

977
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:26,098
- He would never do that.
- Why not? You did.

978
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:28,267
She's been here, like, what...
three minutes?

979
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:29,685
Now you're already defending her.

980
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:31,687
Dad'll do the same thing.

981
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:33,523
He'll let His guard down.

982
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,608
And then she'll destroy Him.

983
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:40,780
I need to make sure that doesn't happen.

984
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:44,200
That's Azrael's Blade.

985
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:45,785
How do you have it?

986
00:37:45,837 --> 00:37:47,453
I borrowed it off the Angel of Death

987
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:48,838
when she wasn't looking.

988
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:51,290
You're not planning on
taking Mom back to Hell.

989
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:54,293
That weapon will wipe her
out of existence entirely.

990
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:56,212
No Heaven, no Hell, just...

991
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:58,965
just gone.

992
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,800
Finally, a moment of clarity between us.

993
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:03,553
You've gone completely insane, brother.

994
00:38:03,638 --> 00:38:05,471
I'm doing what has to be done,

995
00:38:05,523 --> 00:38:07,106
and you've run out of time.

996
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:09,642
See, I don't care about
your deal with Dad.

997
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:12,028
I don't care about what
happens to your little human.

998
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:13,813
But it's obvious you care for her

999
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:16,315
a tad more than you do Mom.

1000
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:19,318
Now, all I need to do

1001
00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:22,371
is hit this one little key right here.

1002
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:25,458
A sequence will begin,
and two days from now...

1003
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:28,160
your cute little human will finally die.

1004
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:31,881
So, Lucifer,

1005
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:34,333
you can either let that happen

1006
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:36,218
or you can give me Mom.

1007
00:38:36,304 --> 00:38:38,304
Last chance.

1008
00:38:39,891 --> 00:38:41,891
You choose.

1009
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:45,261
Very well.

1010
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:51,567
Well, you didn't see
that coming, did you?

1011
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:52,985
Eh?

1012
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:57,823
Actually, I did see it coming.

1013
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:00,242
(grunting)

1014
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:06,198
I mean, I knew you were gonna attack.

1015
00:39:06,284 --> 00:39:08,034
I just wasn't sure how.

1016
00:39:15,426 --> 00:39:16,876
Patterns are tricky like that.

1017
00:39:16,928 --> 00:39:19,095
Takes time to get a real sense of them.

1018
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:23,215
I needed to study you a bit.

1019
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:28,020
Took much less time than I expected.

1020
00:39:28,056 --> 00:39:30,723
Aah!

1021
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:51,494
You're lucky I'd never

1022
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:53,913
use Azrael's Blade on you, brother.

1023
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:00,753
Why don't you pick on a girl?

1024
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:02,054
But I have no qualms

1025
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:05,257
about using it on a filthy,
scum-sucking demon.

1026
00:40:22,777 --> 00:40:24,860
You haven't disappointed, Mazikeen.

1027
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:26,946
Your patterns were tough to see.

1028
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:31,951
Aah!

1029
00:40:34,672 --> 00:40:37,673
But still predictable nonetheless.

1030
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,971
Because you made it so difficult,

1031
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:55,558
now I'm gonna take out
Mom and the detective.

1032
00:40:56,944 --> 00:40:58,444
You can't stop me, brother.

1033
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,869
I didn't see that coming.

1034
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:13,459
(whispers)

1035
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:22,334
What did he say?

1036
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:26,806
I... I couldn't understand.

1037
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:29,341
Prick got what he deserved.

1038
00:41:34,649 --> 00:41:36,649
