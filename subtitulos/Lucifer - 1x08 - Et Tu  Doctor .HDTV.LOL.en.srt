1
00:00:01,587 --> 00:00:03,301
<i>Previously on Lucifer...</i>

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:06,134
Ooh! How's your ex, Detective Douche?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,958
Is this the fight that you want to pick?

4
00:00:08,094 --> 00:00:09,665
You stuck your neck out on Palmetto.

5
00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:11,487
- Look where that got you.
- Okay.

6
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:13,915
Chloe, you are stabbing hard

7
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:15,848
at something that's just not there.

8
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:17,550
There's got to be an explanation

9
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:18,554
for what I saw, Dan.

10
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:19,426
There has to be!

11
00:00:19,578 --> 00:00:20,961
Chloe, this could mean

12
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,929
a lot of things.

13
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:23,497
It means a cop knew

14
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,799
this secret passageway existed, Dan.

15
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:27,301
- What is it?
- A 999 key.

16
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:29,603
LAPD issued. I was right.

17
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:32,172
It's my duty to return the
wings where they belong.

18
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,307
Doesn't part of you long

19
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,675
to assume your form?

20
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,577
Not exactly.

21
00:00:37,856 --> 00:00:39,743
I want what's best for Lucifer.

22
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:40,673
Then give me something

23
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,401
that I can use against
Lucifer, and I'll make

24
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:43,817
sure you're both back where you belong.

25
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:44,985
That's the problem.

26
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:46,587
He doesn't confide in me anymore.

27
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,889
But there is someone he does talk to.

28
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:49,823
A doctor.

29
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:51,125
Hello there, neighbor.

30
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:53,394
I actually need someone to confide in

31
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:54,461
about a patient.

32
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:55,262
And, hey, listen,

33
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,330
if you have any patients

34
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:57,965
you need to talk about...

35
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:02,436
You have no idea.

36
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:26,059
Lovely. Thanks, girls.

37
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:29,883
Ooh!

38
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,699
We'll have to try that later.

39
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,571
Brian! Cheers!

40
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:48,749
Maze! You haven't wished
me happy birthday.

41
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,617
The Devil doesn't have a birthday.

42
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:51,752
Well, I do now.

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
I burned my wings.

44
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,154
I feel reborn.

45
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:55,823
It's my re-birthday party.

46
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:58,258
Reborn? As who?

47
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,093
Whoever the hell I want to be.

48
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,162
It's exciting, isn't it?

49
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,367
Ha-ha.

50
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:10,938
To new beginnings.

51
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,639
Happy birthday to me.

52
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:14,341
Oh, how sweet.

53
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,642
She brought a date.

54
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:29,590
You said "drinks
with a few friends."

55
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:31,225
Well, you know, things got out of hand.

56
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,193
Just the way I like it.

57
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:34,928
We brought you a birthday gift.

58
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:36,096
Is that the royal "we"?

59
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:37,865
Whiskey with a pickle juice chaser.

60
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:40,367
It's our station's birthday tradition.

61
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:42,035
Lovely! How can I refuse?

62
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:43,203
Can I refuse?

63
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:44,338
Of course you can.

64
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:46,640
And we'll always think less of you.

65
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,243
Here's to another trip around the sun.

66
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,577
Cheers.

67
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:58,552
Ah! Ooh!

68
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,120
It's not bad, is it?

69
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:01,188
Briny!

70
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:02,322
Let's find Maze.

71
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,091
She needs to try
this bizarre concoction.

72
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:05,993
She loves a salty aftertaste.

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,261
No. We're just stopping by.

74
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:09,589
We have a department thing to go to.

75
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,364
Some of us work for a living.

76
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:11,732
Well, that's your bad luck, isn't it?

77
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,800
Come on, the party's barely started.

78
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:17,404
Happy birthday, Lucifer.

79
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,089
You sure you want to be here?

80
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:37,658
We can't be the only ones

81
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:39,426
missing Malcolm's welcome back party.

82
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:41,061
If we want to find a dirty cop,

83
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,449
we got to look like team players.

84
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:43,697
Chloe Decker!

85
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,765
Here we go.

86
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:55,809
You and I need to talk.

87
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:58,412
Sure, Malcolm.

88
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,749
You back with this guy?

89
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:04,117
Hmm?

90
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:05,385
How-how, how long was I out?

91
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,487
What, you get the sense knocked
out of you, Decker?

92
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:09,355
- We're just, we're just...
- You know, we have...

93
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,550
Just relax, guys.

94
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:12,192
I'm just... just giving you a hard time.

95
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:16,095
You finally got your
sense of humor back, huh?

96
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,065
Yeah, he's healing fast.

97
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,366
Doc said he should be able

98
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:21,435
to get rid of this
chair in a couple days.

99
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:24,037
You tired of pushing
me around, Paolucci?

100
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:28,208
Look at that, huh?

101
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:30,344
The partner who will not die.

102
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,347
Guess Heaven didn't want him

103
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:34,681
and Hell couldn't keep him.

104
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:37,918
You got no idea.

105
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:43,590
So I, I may have been...

106
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,260
out of line last time I was here.

107
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,664
But I did send flowers.

108
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:52,633
And chocolates.

109
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,335
And now myself, so, save
the best gift till last.

110
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,607
Not enough? No?

111
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,258
You can invite a friend.

112
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,913
Why did you think I'd be mad?

113
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,918
Was it because of this?

114
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:15,022
I've found women, generally,

115
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,824
don't like a man
punching holes in things, yes.

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,195
Lucifer, our last
session was a breakthrough.

117
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,731
It was?

118
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,300
You're finally getting in
touch with your emotions.

119
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,702
Letting your barriers down.

120
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,303
You see, that's part of the problem.

121
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,539
I'd like them back up, thank you.

122
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:33,340
Why?

123
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:34,541
Well, because these emotions

124
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:38,345
are... bloody inconvenient, that's why.

125
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:41,314
What's bothering you right now?

126
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,450
Well...

127
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,318
right now I'm
experiencing a very odd feeling.

128
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,920
It's-it's like a...

129
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,089
it's like a fat man sitting on my chest.

130
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:52,059
But not in a fun way.

131
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:54,361
And when is that happening?

132
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:56,296
Well, um...

133
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:57,564
When you're with Chloe?

134
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:58,865
Yes.

135
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,201
Well, actually, lately,
when she's been with Dan.

136
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,436
Her ex.

137
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:04,438
Well, sort of. Uh...

138
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:06,540
I don't know what she sees in that oaf.

139
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:07,607
Lucifer...

140
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,077
you're jealous.

141
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:13,246
The Devil doesn't get jealous.

142
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,182
I'm the one who
inspires passion in others.

143
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,249
I mean...

144
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:17,451
you know that.

145
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:19,152
Mm, don't I ever.

146
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,220
Thank you.

147
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:22,089
That's the appropriate response.

148
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:26,560
Hold on, maybe it's not me.

149
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:29,429
Maybe it's her.

150
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:31,198
You could fix the detective.

151
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,433
How would I do that?

152
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:36,069
Well, heal her
douche fixation, obviously.

153
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:37,938
Then she stays away from her ex.

154
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:39,439
Then I get my partner back.

155
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:41,541
That's not how therapy works.

156
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:44,945
We deal with your issues.

157
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:46,680
Not someone else's.

158
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,668
Oh, dear! Someone's session went poorly.

159
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:10,570
Mm. Thanks for gracing
us with your presence.

160
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,239
Yes, I had a previous engagement.

161
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,597
Therapy twice in one day. So L.A. of me.

162
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,144
Dr. Bernie Shaw. Killed last night.

163
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,211
No forced entry.

164
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:19,513
Killer most likely knew the vic.

165
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,314
The weapon was improvised.

166
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:22,783
Seems like a crime of passion.

167
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,885
Right. Yeah.

168
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:27,687
Have you ever seen a therapist?

169
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:30,824
You know, for your pent-up
anger and your trust issues.

170
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,592
And your attraction to very dull men.

171
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,162
Let's just focus on the case, shall we?

172
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:36,797
Well, I will, once it's interesting.

173
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,932
Oh! Hello.

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,234
It's interesting... "The
Cheater Therapist."

175
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:43,470
Yeah, he encouraged couples
to cheat to save their marriages.

176
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,572
You can imagine how
many people want to kill him.

177
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,574
I can't, actually. Sounds
like a great idea.

178
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,910
You don't save a marriage by
sleeping with other people.

179
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:51,378
It can't hurt to try.

180
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:53,680
Pretty sure it can.

181
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:01,454
That's the wife Alexandra.

182
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,123
She was out of town and just got back

183
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,257
to find her husband dead.

184
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:05,759
Poor woman.

185
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,594
Excuse me!

186
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:09,229
Your husband was the Cheater Therapist.

187
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:11,131
Hey, I'm not sure who you are,

188
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,066
but this is not the time for judgment.

189
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,534
What? No judgment here, Tissue Lad.

190
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:17,137
I think her husband's work was bang on!

191
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,271
I'm Detective Decker.

192
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,040
This is my associate, Mr. Morningstar.

193
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:20,874
Yeah, yeah.

194
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:22,275
Jonathan Medina.

195
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:23,543
Colleague of Dr. Shaw's.

196
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:26,146
Desire shouldn't be contained...
it's unnatural.

197
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,814
Your husband recognized that.

198
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,251
Bernie, he-he just wanted
to help people.

199
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,320
He dedicated his life to others.

200
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:35,488
Who would do this?

201
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,424
We'll find out, Mrs. Shaw.

202
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,559
Hmm?

203
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:46,557
Every one of her
husband's patients is a suspect.

204
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,333
Oh! Does that mean we get
to dive into patient files?

205
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,370
Read the deepest, darkest secrets

206
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:51,705
of L.A.'s most unfaithful?

207
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:53,473
No, we can't look at
them without a psychologist

208
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,408
to protect patient confidentiality.

209
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:58,375
Perfect! I have just the psychologist!

210
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:00,747
Dr. Linda Martin, from our first
investigation together.

211
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,182
The one that wanted to jump your bones?

212
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,250
- Yeah.
- No. Not happening.

213
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:04,317
No, I really think she'd bring some

214
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:05,886
impressive insight into the issues

215
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:06,987
that you're dealing with.

216
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,388
Uh, in the case.

217
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,176
I really don't. Plus,
it's out of our hands.

218
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:12,592
Court-appointed. A
judge needs to sign off.

219
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,241
Wonderful! Now...

220
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,343
I see you brought your
gavel, like I asked.

221
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:36,316
Oh!

222
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:38,618
Oh, objection, Your Honor.

224
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:50,388
Ah! Now, now...

225
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:51,455
Oh, come on!

226
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,723
I won't tell if you won't.

227
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,026
I swore an oath... to a judge.

228
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:56,327
Oh, did you now?

229
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,461
You only get to read the files

230
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,930
I deem necessary for investigation.

231
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,166
Now, remember our deal.

232
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,368
You have to fix the
detective's broken douche meter

233
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,196
- whilst we investigate this crime.
- Mm-hmm.

234
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:08,306
- I never agreed to that.
- Oh, come now.

235
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:09,874
Don't you want to help me?

236
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:13,611
Hmm? Linda?

237
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,547
Lucifer...

238
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,416
Ah! Speak of the me.

239
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,751
Out here. Now.

240
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,058
What did you do?

241
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,565
Not what, but who, if you must know.

242
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,127
But I try not to kiss and tell.

243
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:32,797
I told you I didn't
want to go with Dr. Martin.

244
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,166
We need someone impartial, which means

245
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,735
not trying to get in
your pants. What...?

246
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,337
Are you even listening to me?

247
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:40,604
Not really. Look.

248
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,040
A new doctor's moved in.

249
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,109
Dr. Canaan.

250
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,877
How Biblical.

251
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:49,347
Sure, let's add another random
doctor to the case.

252
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,748
Great idea.

253
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,051
Now, look, I assure
you, Dr. Martin is excellent.

254
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,087
She trained at
Stanford, she lectures at USC,

255
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,621
she's got stacks of awards...

256
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,657
Since when are you her fanboy?

257
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,891
Since I became a client.

258
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,226
You.

259
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,361
You're really in therapy?

260
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:05,096
Why is that so surprising?

261
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:06,530
You're the least reflective
person I know.

262
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:07,598
I have layers.

263
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,266
I'm like an onion.

264
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,868
An irresistible one.

265
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,236
Dr. Linda

266
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,238
said we recently made a
breakthrough, in fact.

267
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,173
Why do I think that's code for sex?

268
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:17,875
In that particular context, no.

269
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,443
Do you still think you're the Devil?

270
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:20,678
I am the Devil.

271
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,080
Then excuse me if I doubt her skills.

272
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:24,468
Look, she's helped me, all right?

273
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,716
And I think she can be of help here.

274
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,418
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.
- Excuse me.

275
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,320
- Everything okay?
- Yes, Linda,

276
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,721
everything's absolutely
fine... No offense, Dr. Martin...

277
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,156
I found something.

278
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,557
- Hello.
- What is it?

279
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,159
A patient named Richard Kester.

280
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,595
His wife convinced him to
try Dr. Shaw's therapy.

281
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,163
Hmm, let me guess... didn't end well?

282
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,531
She had an affair.

283
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,732
They got divorced.

284
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,402
And then Richard sent Dr.
Shaw a death threat.

285
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:47,138
It's been more than a
year, but that kind of anger

286
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:48,639
can bubble up when you least expect it.

287
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,108
Add him to the list of angry patients.

288
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:52,009
That's just it.

289
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:54,011
Richard's the only one so far.

290
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,447
Dr. Shaw's patients seem
remarkably happy with him.

291
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,548
Oh, do they now?

292
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,483
See, cheater therapy works.

293
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:03,521
Maybe you should've tried
it with Detective Douche.

294
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:06,824
Or was that what broke you apart?

295
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:10,233
What is wrong with you lately?

296
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:12,997
I'll look into him.

297
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,899
Thank you.

298
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,167
Yeah.

299
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,234
Top work, Sherlock.

300
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:24,175
So I don't understand

301
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,276
all this jealousy talk.

302
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:28,239
I mean, why covet
something someone else has?

303
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,813
Why not just take it?

304
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,714
'Cause it's never that easy.

305
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:33,017
Well, it is for me.

306
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,985
Usually.

307
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,722
I, uh, I may have overstepped

308
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,058
earlier in regards to Detective Douche.

309
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:42,193
Yeah.

310
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,861
You definitely may have.

311
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,353
So why did you two separate anyway?

312
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,306
The job was more
important to him than me and Trixie.

313
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,308
But lately something's changed.

314
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,912
He... he makes time for me.

315
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:01,846
He makes time for us.

316
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:04,315
He's really putting in an effort.

317
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:06,650
Yes, if ever anyone deserved

318
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:09,153
a participation trophy, it's Dan.

319
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:20,598
Decker.

320
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:21,665
Uh, hello, Detective.

321
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:22,733
It's about Richard.

322
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,801
I wanted to warn you.

323
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,269
He may be unstable.

324
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,770
Possibly dangerous.

325
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:28,305
I'll handle it, but thanks.

326
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:29,573
I don't mean to you.

327
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,041
I mean to himself.

328
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,980
Yeah, you may be right.

329
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:37,414
Lucifer?

330
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,816
Oh, my God.

331
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,117
There's another one.

332
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,318
Hey, Detective!

333
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:44,121
You need your roots done!

334
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,143
I've made up my mind.

335
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,112
You can't stop me.

336
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,947
What? Oh, no. I'm not here to stop you.

337
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,749
If you want to jump, go for it.

338
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:06,053
Is this some kind of reverse psychology?

339
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,287
No, quite serious.

340
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:08,355
Go for it.

341
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:11,698
Okay, here goes.

342
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:12,926
I do have one
question before you pop off.

343
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:14,962
You see, I'm trying to
understand jealousy.

344
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:17,164
It's a new concept to me.

345
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:20,300
And you, dear Ricky, are the
perfect person to explain it.

346
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:22,603
- What are you talking about...?
- Manners, Ricky.

347
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,570
Manners!

348
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:24,805
We're not done talking yet!

349
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,206
Okay, I'll talk!!

350
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:28,008
Pull me back up, please!

351
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,310
Are you sure? Yeah?
'Cause I could just...

352
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:32,713
Pull me back up!

353
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:35,048
Pull me up, please!

354
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:39,520
Oh, God.

355
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,987
I'd save your breath if I were you.

356
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:43,590
When it comes to this sort
of thing, he's quite judgy.

357
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:46,226
Right, back to the matter in hand.

358
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:49,329
Now, you were so jealous that
you murdered Dr. Shaw.

359
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:50,637
Can you help me understand why?

360
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:52,966
How could you say that?

361
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:55,169
I was about to jump, because he's dead.

362
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:56,603
Don't fib, Rickster.

363
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:57,805
I know about your death threats.

364
00:14:57,872 --> 00:15:00,674
I was in a bad place.

365
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,276
Kara had just dumped me.

366
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:03,610
I made my threats.

367
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:05,145
Then I went to his office...

368
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:06,547
And killed him.

369
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,048
And he talked me down.

370
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,384
And afterwards, he kept seeing me,

371
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,020
even though he knew I
couldn't afford to pay him.

372
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,556
I mean, he'd got me through
my divorce, bankruptcy,

373
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,191
the death of my parrot.

374
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:20,347
Oh, I've just realized

375
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:20,794
you're not jealous, are you?

376
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:22,563
You're just sad.

377
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,298
Pathetic, really.

378
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:27,734
Well, if you can't
tell me what I need to know,

379
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:28,368
what good are you?

380
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:30,871
Aren't you supposed to tell
me that I have a lot to live for?

381
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:31,939
Well, I wish I could, Ricky,

382
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:34,241
but your life sounds incredibly bleak.

383
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,144
Ironically, it seems
there's nowhere to go but up.

384
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:43,183
You know what? You're right.

385
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,618
Hmm?

386
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:47,321
Maybe the worst is behind me.

387
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:48,922
Hmm.

388
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,724
I think I'm ready to go in now.

389
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,392
Well, I wasn't asking, but, uh,

390
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,595
all right, go on, quick as you can.

391
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,563
Come on, chop, chop.

392
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:01,435
I can't believe you, Lucifer.

393
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,203
What? You
should be thanking me.

394
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:06,807
All right, Richard, we
confirmed your alibi with your neighbor.

395
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,408
You're free to go.

396
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:10,210
How did this happen?

397
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:11,678
Poor Sandy.

398
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:12,646
Who's Sandy?

399
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,815
Dr. Shaw's wife, Alexandra.

400
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:17,117
Her friends all call her Sandy.

401
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,287
Okay, and you're friends with
your therapist's wife?

402
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,457
Yes, how open was his
relationship therapy, hmm?

403
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,726
No, it's nothing like that.

404
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,394
That's just how the Shaws are.

405
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:30,097
They go above and beyond.

406
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,332
I just ran into her two days ago.

407
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,301
Sandy was planning a surprise

408
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,370
for Dr. Shaw and everything.

409
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,637
You ran into her two days
ago... are you sure about that?

410
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:39,806
Yeah.

411
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,209
Alexandra told us she was in Phoenix.

412
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:43,176
We checked her alibi.

413
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:44,344
She had plane tickets to prove it.

414
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:45,579
What was the surprise?

415
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:46,980
I don't know.

416
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,249
She just asked me not to
tell Dr. Shaw she was in town.

417
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:51,418
Uh-huh.

418
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:53,954
You can't think she did this?

419
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:10,203
We're closed.

420
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,473
You must be Maze.

421
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:17,311
You're just as Lucifer described.

422
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:23,750
So, you're the doctor.

423
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,252
Oh, call me Linda.

424
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,530
Pleasure to meet you.

425
00:17:34,028 --> 00:17:36,063
I've seen that look in women before.

426
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,497
Won't end well.

427
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:38,865
What won't?

428
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,100
Sleeping with my boss.

429
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:42,769
You'll end up like all the others.

430
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,339
Trash left by the side of the road.

431
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:46,840
Interesting.

432
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:48,075
What?

433
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:49,443
Well, I find people who are rude

434
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,745
usually feel
powerless in their own lives.

435
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:54,414
Terrified of not being in control.

436
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:56,350
But that's not you, I'm sure.

437
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,919
I like you.

438
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Doctor?

439
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,492
What a surprise.

440
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,094
What are you doing here?

441
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,428
I thought you asked me to meet you here.

442
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:10,330
That-that was me. I felt like

443
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:13,100
it would be good to get
your input on the case.

444
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:15,102
That's a good
idea, actually, especially

445
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:17,371
since our last suspect almost
ended up sidewalk art.

446
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:19,873
Turns out Mrs. Shaw flew to Phoenix

447
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:22,509
but rented a car and
drove back a couple days early.

448
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,645
So, dear, sweet Sandy was here

449
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,313
just in time for the murder.

450
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:29,872
Wait, Alexandra Shaw goes by "Sandy"?

451
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,019
The doctor had a female
patient who was stalked

452
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:34,788
by someone with the initials S.S.

453
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,523
He used initials in his notes?

454
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:37,724
I found it odd as well.

455
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,527
Why conceal someone's
identity in private notes?

456
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:43,063
But I thought it wasn't related, so I...

457
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:46,833
Unless S.S. stands for Sandy Shaw.

458
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:48,068
If she was stalking

459
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:50,037
one of her husband's female patients...

460
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:51,438
Then maybe Dr. Shaw

461
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,473
was engaged in his own

462
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,608
open-relationship therapy.

463
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,876
Sandy found out.

464
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:57,144
So maybe she wasn't

465
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,245
okay with it as she claimed.

466
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:00,047
Excuse me.

467
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:02,482
Decker.

468
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,818
Yeah, this is 831.

469
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:08,221
Oh, yeah, tell him I'll
be there as soon as I can.

470
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,723
Okay, thank you.

471
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:12,025
That was dispatch.

472
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:13,160
Dan's phone died,

473
00:19:13,227 --> 00:19:14,628
and he wants me to meet him at my place.

474
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,029
Apparently it's urgent.

475
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:17,264
Oh, how convenient.

476
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:18,632
What's next... he
spills something on his shirt

477
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,766
and he has to take it off?

478
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,469
Oh, no, the trousers, too.

479
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,037
- What?
- What, so that's it?

480
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:25,705
You just go running
as soon as Dan calls?

481
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,973
What about the case?

482
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,961
This could relate to
another case I'm working on.

483
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:30,744
There's units looking for Sandy now.

484
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:32,412
And once they find her, they'll call me.

485
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,914
Bye.

486
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:34,981
Bye.

487
00:19:35,016 --> 00:19:36,249
Unbelievable.

488
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:38,077
You see what I'm
dealing with now, don't you?

489
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:41,521
I think I do, actually.

490
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:43,957
It's worse than I realized.

491
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:46,259
Thank you.

492
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,635
Hey, Dan.

493
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:57,504
What did you find out?

494
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:58,939
Surprise.

495
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,429
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey! I just wanted to talk.

496
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:14,214
You act all chummy in public,

497
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,368
then you break into my home,

498
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:16,601
trick me into meeting you in private?

499
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:19,437
Excuse me if I'm not trusting.

500
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:21,739
Hey, I'm not armed.

501
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,041
All right? Hey.

502
00:20:25,277 --> 00:20:27,979
Huh? It's nothing like that.

503
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:31,672
All right.

504
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:34,285
Then talk.

505
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:36,421
I had to meet with you where
no one else could hear.

506
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:38,089
Hear what... my screams?

507
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:42,126
Decker, we're on the same side.

508
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:43,861
And I know you're
still looking into Palmetto.

509
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:45,797
Well, guess what? So am I.

510
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:47,632
I put that to bed a long time ago.

511
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,200
That the best you got?

512
00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:52,437
God, you're a decent cop, but
you are a terrible liar.

513
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:54,672
Come on!

514
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,940
Palmetto stinks.

515
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:57,375
I should know. I was there.

516
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:59,243
Mm-hmm.

517
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:01,412
Go ahead, say it.

518
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,047
I look dirty.

519
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:05,516
I saw you meet with Nikolas Aoudi.

520
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:07,285
You were laughing.

521
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:08,920
I saw you hand him cash.

522
00:21:08,987 --> 00:21:10,855
I've used him as a CI before.

523
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:12,957
I was buying information.

524
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:16,194
Then we both got shot.

525
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:19,784
And I think it was a cop who shot me.

526
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,733
But you knew that already, didn't you?

527
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:24,068
Why do you think it was a cop?

528
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:25,770
That's what I was paying Aoudi for.

529
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:27,839
Intel on someone crooked at our station.

530
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:29,874
But I think he or she got to me first.

531
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:31,609
That's...

532
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:33,177
that's a great story.

533
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:34,345
I love the ending.

534
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:36,414
It-it ties up all the loose ends.

535
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:37,748
Not really.

536
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:39,217
I can't explain

537
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:42,787
how the crooked cop knew I was there.

538
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:45,690
How'd you find me?

539
00:21:45,757 --> 00:21:47,492
I followed the smell.

540
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,799
You followed the...

541
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:50,261
You know what?

542
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:51,662
Screw this.

543
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,231
I only called you to try and help.

544
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:54,165
Really?

545
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,833
Yeah, really.

546
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:58,436
Listen, Decker, they
pulled the plug on me.

547
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:01,639
Malcolm...

548
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:03,274
I was dead.

549
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:05,443
I-I know.

550
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:09,614
Made me appreciate the
time I've got here.

551
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:11,682
So, personally, I don't think

552
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,186
I'm gonna dig any deeper on this one.

553
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:17,188
And I wouldn't if I were you either.

554
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,924
Not sure if that's a
warning or a threat.

555
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:22,627
I'm not the enemy, Chloe.

556
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:24,795
But whoever we were investigating,

557
00:22:24,863 --> 00:22:27,064
they're still out there.

558
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:30,957
And they clearly don't
have a problem shooting cops.

559
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,244
Decker.

560
00:22:41,313 --> 00:22:42,813
Unis found Sandy Shaw

561
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:44,315
in her car in a parking structure.

562
00:22:44,383 --> 00:22:45,750
Oh, well, I hope our case

563
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:48,052
didn't ruin your kissy-time with Dan.

564
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,421
What is with your recent obsession
with my love life?

565
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:51,756
Obsession?

566
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:53,291
That's awfully defensive.

567
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:55,526
Probably indicates deeper
issues, wouldn't you say?

568
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:56,594
I agree.

569
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:59,864
Why are you so defensive, Lucifer?

570
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:01,532
Good question.

571
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,935
Et tu, Doctor?

572
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:06,103
Lucifer, you asked me
to analyze the situation.

573
00:23:06,171 --> 00:23:08,873
No, I asked you to help
figure out what's wrong with her.

574
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,142
Did you now?

575
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:12,209
But...

576
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:14,078
Nothing's wrong with her.

577
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:16,514
She's a woman balancing
a lot on her plate,

578
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:19,684
and, as far as I can
tell, doing a fantastic job.

579
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:21,285
Why, thank you.

580
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:23,554
You're right, Lucifer, she's amazing.

581
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:24,755
No, she's verbal Ebola.

582
00:23:24,823 --> 00:23:26,390
Where's the button to put the glass up?

583
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,693
This isn't a limo, Lucifer.

584
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
And, Dr. Linda,

585
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:31,696
you should really join us more often.

586
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:35,700
Getting double-teamed is usually
much more fun than this.

587
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,068
Mm.

588
00:23:37,135 --> 00:23:38,202
Gross.

589
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:42,173
So you lied to us.

590
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,941
You were in town the
day your husband died.

591
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:46,644
Yes. But it's not what you think.

592
00:23:46,712 --> 00:23:48,245
Okay, then help me understand.

593
00:23:48,313 --> 00:23:50,848
Sandy, I'm on your side.

594
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,483
Not everything stems from jealousy,

595
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,150
no matter what these women tell you.

596
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:54,909
Hey, Lucifer...

597
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:58,022
You came here driven by some
kind of desire, didn't you?

598
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,223
No.

599
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,057
Come on.

600
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,259
You can tell me. What was it?

601
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:05,296
It's disgusting.

602
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:06,831
Ooh, you naughty girl.

603
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:08,666
Come on, now you have to tell me.

604
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:12,136
It's... in my car.

605
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:15,406
What is, Sandy?

606
00:24:15,474 --> 00:24:16,240
Poop.

607
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:18,242
Oh.

608
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,744
Bags and bags of it.

609
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,979
Oh, my God.

610
00:24:25,484 --> 00:24:27,885
I'm not sure whether to
be horrified or impressed.

611
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:29,520
My friend owns a horse.

612
00:24:29,588 --> 00:24:32,590
That's oddly comforting to know.

613
00:24:32,658 --> 00:24:34,525
What were you gonna do with it?

614
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:36,427
I was going to throw it at Tiffany.

615
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:37,361
That's the patient

616
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:40,564
you were accused of... Stalking.

617
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:42,066
Yeah.

618
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:44,001
She's in a group
therapy session right now

619
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:45,503
for my husband's clients.

620
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,637
Group cheater therapy.

621
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:48,506
Oh, the imagination runs wild.

622
00:24:48,573 --> 00:24:50,107
So Tiffany was sleeping
with your husband.

623
00:24:50,175 --> 00:24:51,242
She was.

624
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:52,476
How'd you find out?

625
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:55,212
My husband's
colleague, Dr. Medina, called me.

626
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,348
Okay, so he told you that
your husband was cheating?

627
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,183
No, he had no idea.

628
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:00,251
He just called to see

629
00:25:00,318 --> 00:25:02,420
if Bernie wanted to
grab a last-minute drink.

630
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:05,256
But Bernie was supposed to
already be with Dr. Medina.

631
00:25:05,323 --> 00:25:07,558
That's when I knew my
husband lied to me.

632
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:09,126
But he was the cheater therapist.

633
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:10,828
I don't quite see the problem here.

634
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:12,029
I mean, you said yourself...

635
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:14,031
The problem is he fell in love with her.

636
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:18,502
I lied to him about my trip,

637
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,673
then I drove back from
Phoenix to see what he was doing.

638
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:23,808
I was...

639
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,042
Don't say it.

640
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,743
Jealous.

641
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:27,111
Yes, yes, we all get it!

642
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,512
Jealousy makes the world go...

643
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,314
I mean, what are you, a girl band?

644
00:25:30,382 --> 00:25:31,482
I loved him.

645
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,550
Oh...

646
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:33,718
I didn't kill him.

647
00:25:33,785 --> 00:25:35,920
I just wanted him back.

648
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:38,823
Oh, great.

649
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,620
- The douche-mobile.
- Give me a second.

650
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:45,796
Hey, I got your text. You okay?

651
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,198
Did Malcolm hurt you?

652
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:48,933
No. I told you, it's-it's fine.

653
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,702
Everything's fine.

654
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,438
I'm gonna punch that son of a
bitch right back into a coma.

655
00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:55,506
Oh, come on.

656
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,441
No. No.

657
00:25:57,509 --> 00:25:58,876
Anything back on the 999 key?

658
00:25:58,944 --> 00:26:01,078
I'm sorry, Chloe.

659
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:03,247
They couldn't get any prints off of it.

660
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:07,151
Thanks.

661
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:09,153
So that's Dan, huh?

662
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:10,254
Yes.

663
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:13,224
Numbingly average, isn't he?

664
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,658
I wouldn't say that.

665
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:18,062
What... You're supposed
to be on my side, you know.

666
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,365
No. I'm supposed to help
you process your emotions

667
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:23,300
so you can deal with
them constructively.

668
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:27,238
Yes, by being on my side and
realizing that I'm right.

669
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:28,539
Lucifer...

670
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:31,041
Is over this conversation.

671
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:32,409
I'm gonna go and talk

672
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:36,881
to some people who are a
little more open-minded, Doctor.

673
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:46,257
Hi. I'm Dr. Medina.
Thank you for coming.

674
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:48,192
All right, looks like we have everyone,

675
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,493
so let's start.

676
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:50,728
Yes! That's a great idea.

677
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:52,196
There's so very much to discuss.

678
00:26:52,264 --> 00:26:55,332
So let's start with the
most important thing, shall we?

679
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,683
Me.

680
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,705
And once again,

681
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:13,807
Lucifer disappears.

682
00:27:13,874 --> 00:27:17,477
I think the case may have
hit a little too close to home.

683
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:18,612
Maybe things got a little too boring

684
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,380
for Mr. Short Attention Span.

685
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,681
I don't know.

686
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:23,783
He's grown quite a bit
since working with you.

687
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,419
I'm not sure I'm the reason.

688
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:28,088
I think you've really helped him.

689
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:30,390
I underestimated you before. I'm sorry.

690
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,325
Not needed. But thank you.

691
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:33,893
And I thought...

692
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:35,595
I thought you were sleeping with him.

693
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,163
Oh, I am.

694
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:38,865
Oh. Oh.

695
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:41,868
Is, um... is that...?

696
00:27:41,936 --> 00:27:42,535
Ethical?

697
00:27:42,603 --> 00:27:44,137
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

698
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,406
No, it is not.

699
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,210
But there's something about him.

700
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:52,078
I can't stop myself.

701
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:56,916
But I think it's time I did.

702
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:00,887
I mean, even I'm starting to feel...

703
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:06,793
So do you think she did it?

704
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:10,463
Sandy claims she was sitting
outside Tiffany's house,

705
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:12,399
waiting for Dr. Shaw to show up.

706
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:14,834
Problem is, no one
can corroborate her alibi.

707
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,103
But, no, I don't think it was her.

708
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:20,473
So there's no one in Dr.
Shaw's files that looked like

709
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:21,741
a potential suspect?

710
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,943
Not that I can tell, but
maybe I missed something.

711
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:25,345
What?

712
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:28,081
The cheater therapist turned out
to be terrible at cheating.

713
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:31,418
Why didn't he tell Dr. Medina
he was using him as a cover story?

714
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:32,719
Maybe he did.

715
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:34,721
Maybe he confided in Dr. Medina.

716
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,456
But Mrs. Shaw said that Dr. Medina

717
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:38,291
had no idea about the affair.

718
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,559
Yeah, so he conveniently told her

719
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:41,467
everything she needed
to know to figure it out.

720
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:43,930
We need to talk to Dr. Medina.

721
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,499
Which brings us to today,

722
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:48,902
where we find Mrs. Shaw

723
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:50,937
with a bag of excrement in her boot.

724
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:52,138
Sorry, trunk.

725
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:54,140
And somehow, out of all that,

726
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,509
they've decided that I'm jealous.

727
00:28:57,578 --> 00:28:59,813
So... what do you think?

728
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Huh?

729
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:01,715
Yes.

730
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,083
So, wait, you're the Devil?

731
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,284
Yes, yes.

732
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:06,119
Please keep up. Anyone. You.

733
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:08,121
When you say you, uh, burned your wings,

734
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:09,189
was that a metaphor...?

735
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:11,024
Not focusing on the right details!

736
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:12,759
Uh, yeah.

737
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:14,094
She was gonna throw poop at me?

738
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,795
God, this isn't about you, Tiffany.

739
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:16,930
All right?

740
00:29:16,997 --> 00:29:18,998
Huh, no wonder you're all in therapy.

741
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:22,268
All right, this is supposed
to be a grief therapy session

742
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:23,603
for the patients of Dr. Shaw.

743
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:27,107
And everyone here has a
terrible loss to deal with.

744
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:28,241
What, and I don't?

745
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,410
I've lost both my
therapist and my partner.

746
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,178
I'm s...

747
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:33,246
Th-They died?

748
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,514
No. No, they turned on me.

749
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:35,615
Some would argue that's worse.

750
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:36,850
All right, you need to leave.

751
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:39,452
No, I'm close to
something. I can feel it.

752
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,187
This is not about you!

753
00:29:41,255 --> 00:29:42,722
Gah.

754
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,125
You're right.

755
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:46,359
Yes.

756
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:48,361
I should use one of you as a case study.

757
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:49,529
Thank you for volunteering.

758
00:29:49,597 --> 00:29:51,598
So what...

759
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,134
what makes you jealous? Hmm?

760
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:58,071
What do you desire that you can't have?

761
00:29:58,139 --> 00:29:59,139
Come on.

762
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:01,341
I...

763
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:02,475
Yeah?

764
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,644
I want Sandy.

765
00:30:06,213 --> 00:30:07,947
What?

766
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,083
Oh.

767
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:12,552
I remember you now.

768
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,121
Tissue Lad!

769
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,291
Wanted some open relationship therapy
of your own, is that it?

770
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,826
That's not what it is like.

771
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:21,561
But she didn't want you, did she?

772
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:23,496
Sandy loved her husband,

773
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:26,332
so you killed him, didn't you?

774
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,233
Shut up!

775
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:28,334
Solved it, haven't I?

776
00:30:28,402 --> 00:30:30,069
Eh?! Haven't I?

777
00:30:31,572 --> 00:30:32,572
So that's a yes.

778
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:33,940
He's got a knife!

779
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:36,276
Do you realize what you've done?

780
00:30:36,343 --> 00:30:38,077
I had to kill him, all right?

781
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:40,380
He lied to her. He cheated on her.

782
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:43,416
And I tried to tip her
off, but no matter what he did,

783
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:44,517
she still loved him.

784
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:45,652
No, no, not that.

785
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,153
This. Right here.

786
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,657
You've just given me the
perfect example of unbridled jealousy.

787
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,992
I'm not jealous. I'm not.

788
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,662
The woman that you
loved was with someone else,

789
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,897
someone you thought
wasn't worthy of her.

790
00:30:57,965 --> 00:31:01,000
But no matter what you did...

791
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,603
she never saw you the
way you wanted her to.

792
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:06,272
That's...

793
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,874
That's pretty accurate.

794
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:09,609
Yeah.

795
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:11,544
You've just made me realize something.

796
00:31:12,813 --> 00:31:16,349
That my situation and yours are...

797
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,852
absolutely nothing alike.

798
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,720
I was right! Not jealous!

799
00:31:20,788 --> 00:31:22,355
Drop your weapon!

800
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,960
- Ow!
- Ooh.

801
00:31:31,165 --> 00:31:32,465
Did you seriously

802
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,067
just bite me?

803
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,603
He's the killer.

804
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:40,373
Yeah, you think?

805
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,328
So you were right about Linda.

806
00:32:02,396 --> 00:32:03,863
She helped me figure out the motive.

807
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:07,600
And then I realized
Jonathan and Dr. Shaw's offices

808
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:09,335
shared the same security system.

809
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:10,537
So I checked and...

810
00:32:10,604 --> 00:32:12,939
You're not listening to me, are you?

811
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:17,477
Afraid not.

812
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:19,746
You didn't see any similarity

813
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,548
between yourself and Jonathan?

814
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:24,317
So you heard some of that, did you?

815
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:25,985
Tail end.

816
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,357
I don't know.

817
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:32,592
Did you?

818
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,262
Mm-mm. No.

819
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,764
Completely different.

820
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,800
That's what I thought.

821
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:45,939
So... how's your secret
case with Dan going?

822
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,206
Secretly terrible.

823
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:48,508
Do you remember Malcolm?

824
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,543
Coma boy?

825
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:52,579
He woke up.

826
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:54,047
He claims he's innocent.

827
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,585
Something he said bothers me.

828
00:32:58,652 --> 00:33:00,153
Whoever shot him knew about Palmetto,

829
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,655
but he says that no one should
have known he was there.

830
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:04,824
Well, you found him there.

831
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:07,160
Yeah, I... He pointed that out, too.

832
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:09,896
So, whoever followed him could
have done what I did.

833
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:11,698
So how did you track him?

834
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:14,167
Partners on the force share
GPS locators in their gear

835
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:16,436
so that they can find
each other in emergencies.

836
00:33:16,503 --> 00:33:19,639
You hacked his partner's locator.

837
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,708
Which means...

838
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:24,243
Malcolm's partner
knew he was there, too.

839
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,814
Tony Paolucci knew.

840
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:51,170
That's Paolucci's car,
just like his GPS said.

841
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,338
But the bar's closed.

842
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:55,541
Maybe he decided to
keep the party going.

843
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,385
You have to stop doing that.

844
00:34:05,452 --> 00:34:07,120
It was unlocked.

845
00:34:17,564 --> 00:34:19,866
Paolucci, you in here?

846
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:50,129
At least you can see
what he was thinking.

847
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:05,546
Dan.

848
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:12,352
I found a suicide note.

849
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:14,555
In his handwriting?

850
00:35:15,423 --> 00:35:16,790
Sure looks like it.

851
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:18,759
Apparently, he was on the take.

852
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,195
Malcolm was onto
him, so Paolucci shot him.

853
00:35:21,262 --> 00:35:22,596
When Malcolm woke up,

854
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,565
Paolucci couldn't
take the guilt anymore.

855
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:32,506
You okay?

856
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:34,675
Paolucci was an ass,

857
00:35:34,742 --> 00:35:37,978
but this... I can't imagine this.

858
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:39,846
I know.

859
00:35:39,914 --> 00:35:41,648
I know.

860
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:02,069
Uh, come in.

861
00:36:02,136 --> 00:36:03,704
Hello, Doctor.

862
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:08,242
Thank you for coming.

863
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:12,012
Uh, I know we're not due for
a session for a few days.

864
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,480
No, my bad.

865
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:16,216
I realize I'm not up to date
on my payments, so...

866
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:19,253
Uh...

867
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,354
don't.

868
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,591
What's wrong? Nothing's wrong.

869
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:26,493
I realized a few things.

870
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:29,196
As I said,

871
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:32,699
we made a breakthrough.

872
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:37,037
And I think, with that in mind,

873
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:39,506
we should keep our
relationship professional from now on.

874
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:40,641
Oh.

875
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:41,775
Are you sure?

876
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:43,810
Very much so.

877
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,513
Very well.

878
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:49,149
If, uh... if you think it's best.

879
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:50,217
I do.

880
00:36:50,218 --> 00:36:51,551
Right.

881
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:55,989
Well, I'll, um... see
you at my next session, then.

882
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:07,234
- One last thing before I go.
- Yes?

883
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:10,170
Dr. Canaan down the
hall... what's he like?

884
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:13,340
Uh, thoughtful.

885
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:15,442
Spiritual. Why?

886
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,344
Little sanctimonious?

887
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:19,146
I don't know. I suppose.

888
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:21,748
Six-foot-two,
black, voice like an angel?

889
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:23,150
Oh, you know him.

890
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:27,954
All too well.

891
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,694
Trixie's finally down.

892
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,996
She conned
you into reading the book

893
00:37:36,064 --> 00:37:38,198
about the sneezing panda, didn't she?

894
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:39,900
Five times.

895
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:48,208
Hey. Um...

896
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:49,976
thank you.

897
00:37:51,212 --> 00:37:52,279
For what?

898
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:56,683
You know, for having my back and...

899
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:58,051
for everything.

900
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:07,994
You're welcome.

901
00:38:09,464 --> 00:38:10,664
For everything.

902
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:26,880
You should go.

903
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:29,750
Yeah, I should.

904
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:31,885
I'm sorry.

905
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:34,755
No. Don't be sorry.

906
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,249
All right.

907
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:04,017
Okay.

908
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:05,318
Bye.

909
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:27,040
Evening, Dan.

910
00:39:29,277 --> 00:39:31,211
I got your text.

911
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:33,079
What do you want?

912
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,251
Just wanted to congratulate
you on closing Palmetto.

913
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:40,921
You and that smart, sexy lady of yours

914
00:39:40,988 --> 00:39:42,889
caught the guy who shot me.

915
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:48,228
That's what the confession said, right?

916
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:52,799
How long did it take you to write it?

917
00:39:54,202 --> 00:39:56,570
Forever. I mean, I'm so not a word guy.

918
00:39:56,637 --> 00:39:58,839
You know?

919
00:39:58,906 --> 00:40:01,575
What? You should be thanking me.

920
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:03,276
Why is that?

921
00:40:03,344 --> 00:40:06,680
Well, I could have
told everyone the truth...

922
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:09,082
that you shot me.

923
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:11,284
Why didn't you?

924
00:40:19,093 --> 00:40:20,594
'Cause I like you.

925
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:24,498
And I can't imagine what
would happen to your life

926
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:27,000
if people found out the truth.

927
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:28,668
Your colleagues, your ex...

928
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:31,338
- I swear to God, I will...
- What? Shoot me?

929
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:33,173
Ah, been there, done that.

930
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:35,208
Big fail.

931
00:40:35,276 --> 00:40:38,144
Besides, you wouldn't want anything

932
00:40:38,212 --> 00:40:39,913
to mess with your pretty little family

933
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:42,415
now that you're
working to fix things, right?

934
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,051
Whatever you want to do to me,

935
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,720
- you keep them out of it.
- Dan.

936
00:40:48,122 --> 00:40:49,923
Come on.

937
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:51,691
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

938
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,227
No.

939
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:56,029
No, no, no, no, no.

940
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:58,431
You... you and I...

941
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,434
we're gonna be best friends.

942
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:02,769
Yeah.

943
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:05,472
Because I got big plans for you.

944
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,040
Big plans.

945
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,311
Fun, right?

946
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:13,580
We're having fun now.

947
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,384
I just learned the strangest thing.

948
00:41:51,452 --> 00:41:55,255
Spoiler alert, Amenadiel
found Dr. Linda.

949
00:41:55,323 --> 00:41:58,558
He was an angel on her
shoulder, trying to control me.

950
00:41:58,626 --> 00:42:01,161
I wonder how my dear, angelic brother

951
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,763
got such a wickedly clever idea.

952
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,867
I did it to protect you.

953
00:42:07,935 --> 00:42:09,269
I told you,

954
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:11,805
whatever the danger, I'll
be there to stop it.

955
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:13,673
Whether you see it coming or not.

956
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,609
You betrayed me, Maze.

957
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:18,244
And not for my own good.

958
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:20,080
You did it for yourself.

959
00:42:21,649 --> 00:42:24,851
Who is this human world really
rubbing off on, eh?

960
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:26,886
Me or you?

961
00:42:27,788 --> 00:42:29,089
- Lucifer, I...
- Ah.

962
00:42:29,156 --> 00:42:31,458
Don't want to hear it.

963
00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:34,427
'Cause you and me, we're done.

964
