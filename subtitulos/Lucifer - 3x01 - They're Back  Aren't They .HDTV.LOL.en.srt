1
00:00:01,462 --> 00:00:04,086
- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
<i>- So, you are the Devil,</i>

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:05,829
and you've left Hell behind

3
00:00:05,854 --> 00:00:08,142
to take a vacation in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,742
Well, where else would I go?

5
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:11,535
I got it. I got it. The name.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,812
The whole Lucifer thing.

7
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:14,560
And desire's, like, your superpower.

8
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,387
Mm, it's more like a
gift from God, really.

9
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:18,580
My God. Your dad did that to you?

10
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:19,803
No, that's where I cut my wings off.

11
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:22,002
Mum's powers are returning,

12
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:24,428
and it won't be long before
we can't contain them.

13
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:26,272
I'm afraid that this ends now.

14
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:29,376
Bloody hell, it worked!

15
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:32,840
- Who are you?
- I should never have

16
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,100
got you involved in any
of this from the start.

17
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:36,950
I just realized something
that I need to do.

18
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:37,740
Detective,

19
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:39,399
I'm coming over now

20
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,016
to tell you the truth about me.

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,114
Are you blind?

22
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,219
The day I've had, I tell you.

23
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:52,189
Right. I'd like a ride
to Los Angeles, please.

24
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:53,423
I... oh.

25
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:54,558
Dearie me.

26
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,959
At least I'm healing fast.

27
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:57,662
Do you have any aloe vera?

28
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,430
I ain't going back to L.A.

29
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:01,499
What...

30
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:05,236
Hold on, you're not a real
armored truck driver, are you?

31
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:07,238
Wait.

32
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:09,240
Don't I know you from somewhere?

33
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:11,093
Oh, yes, yes.

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,427
You're that jewelry thief,

35
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,696
the one who left in
nothing but his manties.

36
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:15,830
You!

37
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:17,668
You got me put in jail!

38
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:19,837
Uh, well, I think that
one's on you, sir.

39
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:21,879
I wasn't the one with the
gun and the ski mask.

40
00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:24,395
I'm not gonna let you screw
this up for me again.

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,846
It's time for you to go.

42
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:27,728
Well, you are a tenacious one,

43
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:28,932
I'll give you that.

44
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:29,713
Respect.

45
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:31,627
You one crazy-ass bitch.

46
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,486
Now, get out of the truck.

47
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,793
Now.

48
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,227
Look...

49
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:38,329
I know you don't want
to shoot me, Mr....

50
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:39,397
What's your name?

51
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:42,024
- Said out, bitch.
- Mr. Said Out Bitch, tell me,

52
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:44,068
what is it you really desire?

53
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:50,875
I just want to get out of here, man.

54
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:53,009
Right, freedom, of course.

55
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:55,313
That hasn't changed.

56
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:59,116
Well, then we might be
able to help each other.

57
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:11,996
Suspect heading towards us.

58
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:13,861
Prepare the blockade.

59
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:35,775
I can't see though.

60
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:39,991
- Eyes on.
- Easy, easy.

61
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:49,088
Don't move!

62
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:51,042
Hello, there.

63
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,200
Hands in the air!

64
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:53,426
That won't be necessary.

65
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,146
I'm Lucifer Morningstar,

66
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:56,881
consultant for the LAPD.

67
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:58,807
I've apprehended this stolen vehicle

68
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:00,366
and all of its contents.

69
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,653
- You're welcome.
- Hands up!

70
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:04,869
- Down on the ground!
- Well, I'd really rather not.

71
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:06,498
I've just got into some clean clothes.

72
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:08,290
Partner name and badge number!

73
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,564
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Detective Decker.

74
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:12,765
I'm afraid I don't
know her badge number.

75
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,103
- Detective Decker.
- But I'd say with certainty

76
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,785
she's a 34-B, if that helps.

77
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:20,556
Hot as hell out here, isn't it?

78
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:22,313
Well, close, anyway.

79
00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:24,367
- Checks out.
- Well, of course

80
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:27,060
it does... I'm never wrong
when it comes to cup size.

81
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:28,415
Okay.

82
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,983
Hold on! What'd you do
with the real thief?

83
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:32,021
Well, unfortunately,

84
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:33,061
he got away.

85
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,028
But not to worry.

86
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,620
I don't think he'll be bothering you

87
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:38,447
for a very, very long time.

88
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,436
Ah. Good.

89
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,771
You're here.

90
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,607
Well, I wasn't sure what
you fancied, so I ordered

91
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:08,517
a little of everything.

92
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,143
Thank you, Benjamin.

93
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,947
Lucifer, what is all of this?

94
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,083
This is your new wellness regime.

95
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:18,804
I thought since I was responsible

96
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:20,896
for your current state, the
least I could do is heal you.

97
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,623
And yes, Benjamin is
part of the package.

98
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,491
He'll be back after dark.

99
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,461
Oh, well, don't worry, he'll be gentle.

100
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,562
Mm.

101
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,631
What? I just want to take care of you.

102
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,799
Is that so hard to believe?

103
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,984
Yes. Out with it.

104
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,216
What's going on?

105
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:44,995
Talk about insult to injury.

106
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,356
I-I-I didn't know that
they could grow back.

107
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:50,335
Are wings

108
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,833
like... body hair?

109
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:54,899
No. Don't be so ridiculous.

110
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:57,206
This is Dad's latest stunt.

111
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,685
A celestial spanking, if you will.

112
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,177
I suppose that's what I get for
giving Mum her own universe.

113
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:03,636
Holy crap!

114
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:04,763
Exactly.

115
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:07,497
Mm. But it's no biggie.

116
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:10,634
I cut them off once, and I
can cut them off again.

117
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:12,770
Now, I'd have Maze do it, but she's off

118
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,271
bounty hunting again, and...

119
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,107
well, I thought, what, with
your medical expertise

120
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:19,304
- and training...
- Even if I was

121
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,363
that kind of doctor, I'm pretty sure

122
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,218
they're not teaching
wing-ectomies in med school.

123
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:23,865
No, no, no,

124
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,101
it's quite simple... it's just
snip, snip, and Bob's your uncle.

125
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,825
Well, God's your Father, Lucifer.

126
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,417
And things are never simple with Him.

127
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,268
You don't know why for sure
your wings have returned.

128
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:33,818
They've returned

129
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,024
because Dad is a control freak.

130
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,625
He's pissed off that
He can't get Mum back,

131
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,418
so He stuck my wings back on.

132
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:43,196
But I am not His Mr. Potato Head.

133
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,795
And don't worry, I fully plan
to track down Dad's emissary

134
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,226
on Earth, and give him a return message.
But for now...

135
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:51,523
Emissary? You think God sent
someone to do this to you?

136
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:52,749
Never mind all that.

137
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:54,827
Right now I need you to help me.

138
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,167
So come on, chop-chop.

139
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:57,126
No.

140
00:06:57,898 --> 00:07:00,100
As your therapist, I'm sorry,

141
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,867
but I can't do this.

142
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:03,975
- Well, as a friend, then.
- Yes, as a friend

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,968
who got caught in the cross
fire, I beg you, please,

144
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:10,268
think this through before
you do something rash.

145
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:11,355
I...

146
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,549
I almost died because
of your family drama.

147
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:18,401
Right.

148
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,780
But you can definitely text
me Ben's number, though.

149
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,074
Okay.

150
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:33,748
Oh, gosh, it's hard enough
just to scratch your own back.

151
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:40,235
Right, it's okay, it's okay, you
can call off the search party.

152
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,361
I'm unharmed.

153
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:49,106
'Sup, wimp?

154
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,442
Detective, Detective, I am so sorry.

155
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,452
You must have been so
worried in my absence.

156
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:55,569
Your absence? I saw you two days ago.

157
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:57,628
I thought you were just avoiding
meeting the new lieutenant.

158
00:07:57,697 --> 00:07:59,156
New who? Never mind, I don't care.

159
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:01,251
We've got something much more
important we need to discuss.

160
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:03,010
Oh, is this about the message you left?

161
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:05,036
Message? Oh, right.

162
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,269
Uh, well, we will talk about that later,

163
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:10,073
but right now we need to
figure out who kidnapped me.

164
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,338
Kidnapped you?

165
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,429
Okay, I'll play. Who kidnapped you?

166
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:15,601
I don't know.

167
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:17,592
Well, what did they look like?

168
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,251
I don't know.

169
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:20,445
L-L-Look,

170
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:22,424
I'm fairly certain that
my Father's behind it.

171
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:24,311
Your father kidnapped you?

172
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,967
Well, no, not Him personally.

173
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:28,025
God never gets His own
hands dirty, does He?

174
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:29,385
Uh-huh.

175
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,677
You don't believe me.

176
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:32,069
Uh-huh. Sorry.

177
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,118
This is just a little
far-fetched, even for you. Right.

178
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:35,936
- Okay, fine.
- Mm-hmm.

179
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:37,811
I'll take you to the scene of the crime.

180
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:39,070
Come on. Come on!

181
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,506
Yes, I'm sure.

182
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:51,594
It's just... past this shrub.

183
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:53,867
Well, I don't see anything.

184
00:08:53,892 --> 00:08:55,871
What? I...

185
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:58,641
Ah! Ha-ha! Footprints.

186
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,168
Those are mine.

187
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:02,059
Oh. Well...

188
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:04,781
well, then the wind must have blown

189
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:05,982
the crime scene bare, Detective,

190
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,395
because I am not lying.

191
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:09,442
Someone kidnapped me. I
was outside the hospital,

192
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,001
leaving you a message, and
someone stashed me...

193
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:12,387
So this was about that message.

194
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:13,545
Look, Lucifer,

195
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,389
if you regret what you said,
if this kidnapping tale

196
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:19,227
is some elaborate distraction,
you can just stop.

197
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:21,280
All right? You don't need
to tell me anything.

198
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:23,883
- I'm no stranger to the drunken dial.
- Yes, I have been known

199
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:26,813
to avoid the issue at times,
but that is not the case here.

200
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:31,180
Detective, I swear, this is the
scene of a despicable crime.

201
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,683
What?

202
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,951
I...

203
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:38,086
I believe you.

204
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:53,065
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

205
00:09:54,713 --> 00:09:58,126
Soaked in sweat, parched and starving,

206
00:09:58,151 --> 00:10:01,520
he scraped, clawed his
way towards the light,

207
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:03,214
but, ironically,

208
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,674
the only thing stronger
than his desperate desire

209
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:07,024
to live was...

210
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,858
the sun... its relentless heat

211
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:11,844
literally cooking him, until one last...

212
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:13,536
breath...

213
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:15,195
and he's gone.

214
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:19,060
Tragic. But, now, can we
please get on with it?

215
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,243
Whoever killed this dehydrated sap

216
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:23,436
is clearly responsible
for my devil-napping.

217
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:25,629
I mean, the location's
far too coincidental.

218
00:10:25,654 --> 00:10:26,955
Who is he, and what does he

219
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,025
- have to do with me?
- Steve Banales.

220
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,851
Owner and CEO of Angelette Hotel.

221
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,866
Steve Banales. That's strange.

222
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:35,181
Never heard of him.

223
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:37,441
You'd think we'd have
some kind of connection.

224
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:40,402
I suppose we'll get more answers
once we find our assailant.

225
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:42,427
Hey, Jerry. I think I
found some footprints.

226
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:43,669
What?

227
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:44,865
No, those are mine.

228
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,967
Amateurs.

229
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:49,169
How did we get stuck with
the "B" team, anyway?

230
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:51,228
Lucifer, this is Lancaster PD.

231
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:53,088
The crime scene is on the L.A. border,

232
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:54,448
so they're here helping.

233
00:10:54,473 --> 00:10:56,518
I mean, I think they're
doing a great job.

234
00:10:56,543 --> 00:10:59,664
Geez. These Lancaster guys
are a bunch of tools.

235
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:01,333
Oh.

236
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:02,801
Speaking of tools, whoa, whoa.

237
00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:05,161
Whoa, hey, Detective? Detective?

238
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,718
- So, what'd you find?
- Looks like a key chain.

239
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:13,191
Hey, guys, look at this.

240
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,116
Finally. A clue.

241
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,408
An "A"?

242
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:18,404
- Right. Off we go, Ms. Lopez.
- Oh, uh,

243
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,544
hold up, bud. I need to do
one more lap of the scene.

244
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:22,652
Want to make sure we
didn't miss anything.

245
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:24,418
I mean, not that I
don't trust Lancaster.

246
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:26,990
I just don't want to
disappoint our new lieutenant.

247
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:28,847
Oh, my gosh, you guys, did I tell you

248
00:11:28,872 --> 00:11:31,177
that I saw Lieutenant Pierce
speak at a conference last year?

249
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,747
"The Red Tape Beyond the Yellow Tape."

250
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:35,039
Riveting.

251
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:36,139
- Sounds it.
- Yeah, you told us.

252
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:37,061
Yup, you did.

253
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:38,858
Anyway, big fan.

254
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:41,050
The guy is a serious rock star.

255
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,507
I can't believe he transferred here.

256
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:43,966
We are so lucky.

257
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:46,915
And I hear he's a total
sweetie pants to boot.

258
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,607
I'm Lieutenant Marcus Pierce.

259
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:13,106
All right, back to it.

260
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,466
Uh, Detective Daniel Espinoza.

261
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:20,994
Heard a lot about you, Lieutenant,

262
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:23,521
and I'm really excited to work with you.

263
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:25,579
I wish I could say the same.

264
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:28,121
Aren't you that corrupt
cop that got off easy?

265
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,213
Excuse me?

266
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:31,116
No. Excuse me.

267
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:33,574
You must be Lucifer.

268
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:36,255
Morningstar. Pleasure.

269
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,426
There was an investigation last year.

270
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:41,638
We interviewed... what was it...
92 of your sexual partners?

271
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:43,716
I think I'll refrain
from physical contact

272
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:44,830
if you don't mind.

273
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:48,248
You don't seem reckless.

274
00:12:48,721 --> 00:12:51,158
Narcissistic, hedonistic... that I see.

275
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:52,340
Well, thank you very much.

276
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:54,567
Not a compliment. Your file
is as long as my Johnson.

277
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:55,959
Oh. Quick read then?

278
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,532
- Hardly.
- Well, I, for one,

279
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:58,791
don't need a file to ascertain

280
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:01,424
you haven't even had a
snog in ages, have you?

281
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,870
Accurate.

282
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:04,118
Okay!

283
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:07,249
Hi. I am Detective Decker.

284
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:08,908
Lucifer's partner. I know.

285
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,511
Actually, he's mine.

286
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,712
Uh, uh, consultant, to be exact.

287
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:14,972
- That's what I said.
- But, uh...

288
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,068
Well?

289
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:18,736
Isn't he amazing?

290
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,112
We just had the best conversation

291
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:21,737
over the doughnuts I brought for him...

292
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,245
everyone, not just him. I'm not

293
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,620
kissing ass or anything.
Mm-hmm.

294
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:27,708
Doughnuts for everyone! Doughnuts!

295
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:28,832
- Right.
- Wow.

296
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:30,817
- Wow.
- Lucifer.

297
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,151
I've been looking all over for you.

298
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,060
Uh, through here. Go.

299
00:13:42,742 --> 00:13:44,115
So what happened?

300
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:45,873
It was terrible, Brother.

301
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:47,231
I was kidnapped.

302
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:50,425
No, Luci. I meant Mom.

303
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,646
Ah. Well, didn't you get my text?

304
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:56,944
What? You mean the string
of nonsensical emojis?

305
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,295
Fire, sword, doughnut, spaceman,

306
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,622
clock, dancing lady,
flashlight, thumbs up.

307
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,594
How am I supposed to
know what that means?

308
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:06,128
I ignited the flaming sword,

309
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,120
used it to cut a hole in space and time,

310
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:09,316
Mum's light flooded through it,

311
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:11,309
then it closed up behind her. All good!

312
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:18,262
Mom's... Mom is gone?

313
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:19,957
Yes.

314
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,602
Yes. I mean, she says good-bye forever,

315
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:26,159
she loves you very much,
et cetera, et cetera, but

316
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:28,185
the good news is...

317
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:30,645
you get your necklace back.

318
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,252
And we all know how
attached to that you are.

319
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:36,223
So, back to more current issues.

320
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:37,516
Me and my kidnapping.

321
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,292
Now, clearly Dad is behind it,

322
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:41,085
but the question is, who's his emissary,

323
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,110
and how were they able to
render me unconscious?

324
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:45,689
Either they used some
kind of celestial weapon,

325
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:47,111
or the detective was nearby.

326
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:47,900
And if it's the latter, then it has

327
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:50,348
to be someone who knows
she makes me vulnerable.

328
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:53,666
Hang on.

329
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:59,776
The "A" on the key chain is
for Amenadiel, isn't it?

330
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:02,100
- What?
- Of course.

331
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,599
It's you! Now that God's favorite son's

332
00:15:04,616 --> 00:15:07,882
regained his powers, he's back
to being his little bitch.

333
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,054
Luci, I didn't get my powers back.

334
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:13,643
Yes, I was able to slow time, but...

335
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:17,461
uh, that appears to have
been a one-time thing.

336
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:21,103
But... you have got
your wings back, huh?

337
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,595
No.

338
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,508
Not yet.

339
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,889
Well, isn't that ironic?

340
00:15:27,914 --> 00:15:30,316
You want your wings back and
didn't get them, and...

341
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:32,892
I...

342
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:36,605
get whacked over the head and
hauled out to the desert.

343
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:38,909
That's not ironic.

344
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:40,393
Well, not ironic ironic.

345
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:42,206
More... Alanis Morissette ironic.

346
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,534
Anyway, the point is,

347
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,815
I'm sure your full powers
will come back in no time.

348
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,042
You probably just need... a good nap.

349
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,135
Or eat some mangos. I've
heard they work wonders.

350
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,995
- What?
- We got a suspect.

351
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,612
Prints on the key chain.

352
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:55,323
First, it looked like
it had been wiped down.

353
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:58,984
Then, I whipped out the color
fluorescent film, and whammo.

354
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,630
- Well done, Miss Lopez...
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:03,964
Oh, sorry. We haven't
officially met yet.

356
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:05,632
I'm Ella.

357
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:08,741
- Amenadiel.
- I mean,

358
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:12,681
I've seen you around, doing your
handsome broody thing, but...

359
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:17,605
Anyway, any bro of Lucifer's
is a bro of mine.

360
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:20,756
Whoa.

361
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,149
Someone works out.

362
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:24,633
Now I know who carries

363
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:26,702
- the guns in the family.
- Right, yes.

364
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:28,781
Enough of that. We have a suspect.
Shall we?

365
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:30,244
Oh, Brother?

366
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,705
About your problem... Yeah.

367
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,163
I think I might have just the remedy.

368
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:38,127
I'll text you the info later.

369
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,127
Words this time, please!

370
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,654
Josh Hamid, the victim's
business partner.

371
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,013
The two own this hotel.

372
00:16:57,038 --> 00:16:58,185
Well, this is a mug shot.

373
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,201
Has he got a record?

374
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,286
Yeah. Possession of an exotic animal.

375
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,403
A tiger, I think.

376
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:04,207
Oh, that's illegal? Too bad.

377
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,560
Yeah, anyhow, looks like

378
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:08,047
Josh and Steve both
come from family money.

379
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:10,454
Basically bought this hotel
just to have a place to party.

380
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,111
Imagine, buying your own establishment

381
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,712
just to justify your decadent lifestyle.

382
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:16,420
It's absurd.

383
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:18,446
Yeah. Absurd.

384
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,505
Thank you.

385
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:34,722
Josh Hamid?

386
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,152
Who wants to know?

387
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:39,145
Detective Decker, LAPD.

388
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,249
I imagine you recognize me.

389
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:45,142
You got a nice set of cans for a cop.

390
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,454
Right. Whilst I don't disagree,

391
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,946
that is incredibly disrespectful.

392
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:49,571
Perhaps I should teach you some manners.

393
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:51,397
Lucifer, I got this.

394
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:54,039
Got a nice ass, too.

395
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:56,414
Yeah? Well, I also got these,

396
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:59,766
and your sorry ass is a suspect
in the Steve Banales murder.

397
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,560
I told you Steve was up to something.

398
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:04,099
You want to cuff me, honey?

399
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:06,197
You're gonna have to catch me.

400
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:07,932
Excuse me.

401
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:22,334
Oh, you've got a gun.

402
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,592
Scary.

403
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:26,452
Hey, you tell Steve I am
officially impressed.

404
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:28,100
You think this is funny?!

405
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,209
Lucifer!

406
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,397
Well, maybe it's a bit funny.

407
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,574
So, Josh...

408
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,201
Why did you kidnap me?!

409
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:58,889
I swear, I've never seen you

410
00:18:58,913 --> 00:19:00,716
before you tried to kill me today!

411
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:02,240
Really, Joshy.

412
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:03,779
Excuse us.

413
00:19:06,473 --> 00:19:08,074
What?

414
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:09,341
- What are you doing?
- Consulting.

415
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:10,900
Then consult less.

416
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,191
So you say you don't recognize Lucifer,

417
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:16,825
but you do admit to knowing
Steve Banales, correct?

418
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,886
Then did you do this to him?

419
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:22,988
This is a joke, right?

420
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:24,872
We found this at the crime scene

421
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,232
with your fingerprints all over it.

422
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:28,936
I didn't kill Steve, man! I would never!

423
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:31,959
That's the key I gave
to the fake kidnappers.

424
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:33,284
- Fake?
- Yeah.

425
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:35,278
They get paid to abduct people.

426
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:36,971
I hired them for Steve.

427
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:38,430
- It's our thing.
- What?

428
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:41,645
- To torture each other?
- No! To pull pranks.

429
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,643
The more money we made,
the crazier the prank.

430
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:46,488
The fake kidnapping was retaliation

431
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:49,926
for the tiger Steve...
put in my backyard.

432
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,417
What's the name of the company?

433
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:52,742
Snatched.

434
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:54,718
Super under the radar.

435
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,177
I-I got the deluxe package.

436
00:19:56,202 --> 00:19:57,869
Ah. Well, they delivered.

437
00:19:57,894 --> 00:20:00,253
They were supposed to
nab Steve for 48 hours,

438
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:02,314
tie him up in a warehouse,

439
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:04,517
stick him in the desert,
and then drop him back

440
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,222
at the hotel. When he didn't show,

441
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,583
I just assumed he was...
busy planning payback.

442
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,909
It's why I thought you
weren't real cops.

443
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,422
I mean, a guy named Lucifer and
the chick from Hot Tub Hotel?

444
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,189
- High School.
- Hot Tub High School.

445
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:18,353
She wasn't in the sequel.

446
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:21,181
I'm sorry. Anyway, can you blame me?

447
00:20:21,206 --> 00:20:23,532
Look, here's the thing, Joshy.

448
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,457
I can assure you we are quite real,

449
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:27,316
and by the looks of it,
so are your kidnappers,

450
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:29,438
so tell us what you know
about this Snatched.

451
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:41,441
All right, Luci, I got your text.

452
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:44,245
What's this magical remedy of yours?

453
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:52,582
Hi. I'm Remedy.

454
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:55,635
I'm here to rub you.

455
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:59,180
Uh, give you a massage.

456
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:01,831
Oh.

457
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:07,332
Well, why not?

458
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:10,593
Lovely. Um, please remove your clothing

459
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,561
and get under the towel.

460
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:14,927
We're gonna need a bigger towel.

461
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,067
I know where they are.

462
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:20,163
I'll be right back.

463
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:51,600
Oh, man. I searched the IP address,

464
00:21:51,668 --> 00:21:53,458
like, a zillion times
and it keeps pinging

465
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:55,249
to some random Russian server.

466
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,724
Surely there's some other way
to track these miscreants.

467
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,412
Something we missed at
the crime scene perhaps?

468
00:21:59,437 --> 00:22:01,951
I wish. All we found
there was that key chain

469
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,155
and our second victim.

470
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,594
- Wait. Second victim?
- Leo.

471
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:07,753
Once a vibrant rock squirrel.

472
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:10,880
Now... roadkill.

473
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,913
Judging from his time of death,

474
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:16,407
about 16 hours before Steve
died of dehydration.

475
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:18,017
It's pretty likely the kidnappers

476
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:19,165
are the ones who ran him over. Mmhmm.

477
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,884
Poor guy never even saw it coming.

478
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:23,102
So, did you lift any tire treads?

479
00:22:23,127 --> 00:22:24,337
Sure did.

480
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:28,061
Leo was squashed by a
Ryuk Road Crusher tire.

481
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:29,107
Commercial grade.

482
00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:31,736
Only 850,000 sets produced.

483
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:33,218
- In the world?
- Nope.

484
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:36,064
- In L.A.
- Oh, for goodness' sakes.

485
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,041
You know, there still is one angle

486
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,933
that we haven't quite explored yet.

487
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,987
And that is your connection to the case.

488
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,511
Oh, and I wasn't sure you
thought there was one.

489
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:49,017
Well, I'm still not sure
I do, but we're stuck,

490
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:53,111
so do you think your kidnapping
was intended as a prank?

491
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:54,954
Or to actually hurt you, like Steve?

492
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:56,179
Definitely the latter.

493
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:57,871
My Father is not a jokester.

494
00:22:57,896 --> 00:22:59,430
Right.

495
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,723
Right. So, say your father

496
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,219
did hire these fake kidnappers...

497
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:05,012
- He did.
- to...

498
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:07,594
- Hmm.
- Any idea why?

499
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,207
Of course. He's angry that I
gave Mum her own universe.

500
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:13,490
I mean, nothing pisses God off
more than exercising free will.

501
00:23:13,515 --> 00:23:15,919
- I am trying to believe you here.
- Something horrid

502
00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:18,264
happened to me and I woke up in
the desert with my bloody...

503
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:19,664
wi...

504
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,086
What?

505
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:25,386
Okay, Detective. I
understand your confusion.

506
00:23:25,411 --> 00:23:27,497
And, although I've told you
the truth from the beginning,

507
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:28,980
you're a woman of logic and reason.

508
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:33,061
And... that-that is why I
left you that message.

509
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:34,717
You require proof.

510
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:38,292
And I suppose now is as good a
time as any to give it to you.

511
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,529
So perhaps you should sit.

512
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,448
Okay.

513
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:46,607
Mm-hmm.

514
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:55,144
Oh, right.

515
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:57,671
Yeah. Maybe I should... leave.

516
00:23:57,738 --> 00:24:00,319
You know, uh, third wheel.

517
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:02,479
Watch out.

518
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,166
Okay.

519
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:10,422
Lucifer, just show me
what you need to show me.

520
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:11,916
You know, I don't need
anything to drink.

521
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:14,008
Well, I do.

522
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,375
I have tried to be honest with you,

523
00:24:20,457 --> 00:24:23,158
but if I'm being honest with myself,

524
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:25,794
and I have held the real
truth back from you,

525
00:24:25,862 --> 00:24:28,664
and you, of all people, deserve
to know that, Detective.

526
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:32,635
Which is why I want to show you.

527
00:24:33,747 --> 00:24:36,480
Lucifer, whatever it is

528
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:38,522
that you want to show me

529
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:42,787
or that you want to tell me, it's okay.

530
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,882
I'm here for you.

531
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:47,097
Okay.

532
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:50,466
Then, once and for all,

533
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:53,093
I'd like to show you who I really am.

534
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,762
Okay.

535
00:24:57,277 --> 00:24:58,811
You ready?

536
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:03,003
Yeah.

537
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:19,994
Oh, my God. What? Are you gassy?

538
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,158
Why is it not working?

539
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:26,689
Why isn't what working?

540
00:25:26,714 --> 00:25:28,838
What? I don't understand.

541
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:31,082
I do.

542
00:25:31,553 --> 00:25:33,487
You know, I keep caring,

543
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:36,506
and you... you just...

544
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,609
Just...

545
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:41,542
No, Detective! I...

546
00:25:42,949 --> 00:25:45,334
I...

547
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:48,360
really am the Devil.

548
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,961
Well, that sucks.

549
00:25:56,641 --> 00:25:58,776
Dead ends piss me off.

550
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:01,900
Which is why I don't believe in them.

551
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,352
Now, these kidnappers might be
fake but they're not invisible.

552
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:05,677
There has to be a way to find them.

553
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:07,148
You're right.

554
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,492
If Muhammad won't come to the mountain,

555
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:09,824
the mountain must go to Muhammad.

556
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:11,501
I have no idea what that means, Decker.

557
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,194
Well, someone needs to get kidnapped.

558
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:14,453
Now, there's an idea.

559
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,834
That I was just suggesting.

560
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:17,093
No one likes a credit hog, Decker.

561
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,311
Now, who would be the bait?

562
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:19,536
Well, I'd like to volunteer.

563
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:20,780
Uh, it's not a good idea.

564
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:22,421
If these are the same
guys that abducted,

565
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:24,347
allegedly, Lucifer, they're
gonna recognize him.

566
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,174
Right. We need somebody
who's a lot less, well...

567
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,357
everything.

568
00:26:29,382 --> 00:26:30,678
Esperanza.

569
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:32,414
Es-Espinoza.

570
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:34,609
And, sure, that makes, uh, makes sense.

571
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,109
I have the most experience in the field,

572
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:37,328
so if something goes wrong, then...

573
00:26:37,353 --> 00:26:38,553
You're expendable.

574
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:39,578
Exactly.

575
00:26:39,603 --> 00:26:41,130
Thank you.

576
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:43,961
Now go get kidnapped, Esperanza.

577
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:54,027
Hey, excuse me, I was
wondering if I could get a...

578
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:55,050
We're closed.

579
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:56,910
We ran out of meat.

580
00:26:57,105 --> 00:26:58,372
All right, Daniel.

581
00:26:58,397 --> 00:26:59,898
You're not allergic to gerbils, are you?

582
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:01,320
Just making some last-minute adjustments

583
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:02,704
to the questionnaire.

584
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:04,601
Hilarious.

585
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,728
Hey, Lucifer, did you set
up the pickup point?

586
00:27:06,753 --> 00:27:08,472
Yes. Tour bus pickup.

587
00:27:08,497 --> 00:27:09,507
Olvera Street.

588
00:27:09,532 --> 00:27:10,907
Exactly one half hour from now.

589
00:27:10,932 --> 00:27:12,699
All right, good.

590
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:15,911
Hey. You know the team

591
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:18,387
will intervene before
anyone gets hurt, yeah?

592
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:20,703
Yeah.

593
00:27:20,728 --> 00:27:22,686
Okay.

594
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:24,584
Look, if you're upset about
what the lieutenant said,

595
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,572
you're not alone.

596
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:27,080
He's not a fan of mine, either.

597
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,545
And I still can't believe he
called me "Lucifer's partner."

598
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,104
You are my partner!

599
00:27:32,688 --> 00:27:34,756
You know, the truth is, I
am feeling expendable.

600
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:36,746
- Why?
- It's not because Pierce said it.

601
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:38,839
It's because of Charlotte.

602
00:27:38,938 --> 00:27:40,372
Oh.

603
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,728
Yeah, after everything that
happened at the beach,

604
00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:44,854
she's acting like she
doesn't even know me.

605
00:27:45,168 --> 00:27:47,403
I'm not an idiot, I know
she was using me at first,

606
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:51,023
but... but then it seemed
like she actually cared.

607
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:53,656
Well, um... Whatever.

608
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:55,182
I'll get over it.

609
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,374
I'm sorry, Dan.

610
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,813
Yes, I'm sorry, too, Daniel,

611
00:27:57,838 --> 00:28:00,012
that I can't hear you. Could
you speak up, please?

612
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:02,325
T minus 20, people.

613
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,984
Take your mark, Espinoza.

614
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:06,144
Right, I'll check in with
McMillian at the lookout point.

615
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:07,938
Okay.

616
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:12,755
Uh, Daniel.

617
00:28:14,578 --> 00:28:16,851
- Listen, uh...
- Come on.

618
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:19,044
Oh, right. Undercover, yes.

619
00:28:19,112 --> 00:28:21,757
Listen, I know you were
talking about Charlotte.

620
00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:25,398
And as douchey as you may be,
and I know you can't help it,

621
00:28:25,423 --> 00:28:28,179
her current behavior has
nothing to do with you, okay?

622
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:29,905
And as much as I
appreciate the pep talk,

623
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,865
Lucifer, it was kinda you that got me

624
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,725
in the whole Charlotte
mess in the first place.

625
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,264
So maybe you should just

626
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:37,843
take care of your side of the
street for a change, all right?

627
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:39,927
Good talk.

628
00:28:40,983 --> 00:28:43,404
My side of the street.

629
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:45,974
That's a good idea.

630
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,326
Leo?

631
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:03,081
Oh.

632
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:08,052
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you,

633
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:09,668
but do you have any idea
where my brother went?

634
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:11,511
He's ignoring my phone calls.

635
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:14,735
Oh, bud, no, no, no. He's
totally not ignoring you.

636
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,189
He's just in the middle
of this sting operation.

637
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,714
Oh.

638
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:19,884
Can I help?

639
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:22,070
That's very nice of you, but no.

640
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,996
It's personal.

641
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,306
You a believer?

642
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:34,773
Well, then, whatever it
is you're going through,

643
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:37,233
I'm sure it's all part of His plan.

644
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:38,908
I mean, even the most

645
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,022
pathetic, sad sack, powerless
of creatures serve a purpose.

646
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,866
Like Leo here.

647
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:51,135
A van may have cracked his nuts
in the middle of the desert,

648
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,626
but he's still valuable evidence.

649
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:56,143
That's the thing. You never know

650
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:59,119
when your rock-bottom
pain and humiliation

651
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:00,978
can end up helping others.

652
00:30:01,003 --> 00:30:03,648
I mean, God works in mysterious ways.

653
00:30:03,673 --> 00:30:06,949
So you just got to believe that
when He crushes your nuts,

654
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:08,544
He does it for a reason.

655
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:09,770
Has this, um,

656
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:13,732
Leo provided you with
a break in your case?

657
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,693
Not yet.

658
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:19,239
But you got to have faith, right?

659
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:24,239
Right. Right.

660
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:29,947
The kidnappers are seven minutes late.

661
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:32,607
Yeah, well, we didn't give them a
lot of prep time; don't worry.

662
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:34,232
I'm worried.

663
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:35,290
Where are they?

664
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:36,921
They'll be here.

665
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,967
Come on.

666
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,625
Come on, be here. Be here.

667
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:49,807
Oh, lovely. Right on time.

668
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,468
Hello. Right. How do we do...

669
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,357
Oh, careful. I bruise like a peach.

670
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:57,607
Easy.

671
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:05,745
_

672
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:13,169
Seriously?

673
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:24,757
Ah, there you are.

674
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,429
I have to say, the leaky
pipe is a nice touch.

675
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:29,689
Very Blood Simple.

676
00:31:29,882 --> 00:31:31,983
Coen Brothers movie?

677
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:33,509
No?

678
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:35,469
Oh.

679
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,360
Well,

680
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:39,341
hello, kidnappers.

681
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:42,950
Finally, I have you
right where I want you.

682
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:49,301
Let's see, so many questions,

683
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,995
how did you abduct me the first time?

684
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,153
Hmm? How did you render me unconscious?

685
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,692
Ow. What are you doing?

686
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:58,036
Stop it, that tickles.

687
00:32:02,661 --> 00:32:04,161
We used this last week, right?

688
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:05,120
Yeah.

689
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:07,770
Did you forget to charge it?

690
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:09,489
No. I didn't forget to charge it.

691
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:11,448
Dude.

692
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:13,618
- Not cool.
- I just don't get it.

693
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:15,144
I don't know. I hate to interrupt.

694
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:20,106
Where were we?

695
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:25,194
Remind me not to leave Lucifer
in the front seat unattended.

696
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:26,753
And remind me to kick his ass

697
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,352
for humiliating me in front of Pierce.

698
00:32:28,377 --> 00:32:29,991
Well, I'll help you if we can find him.

699
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:31,250
Look...

700
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:32,834
don't worry, Chloe.

701
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,616
Lucifer can take care of himself.

702
00:32:34,641 --> 00:32:36,062
Found Lucifer's phone...

703
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,875
in some bushes on Alameda Street.

704
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:39,353
Kidnappers must have tossed it.

705
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:40,611
What about, uh, traffic cams?

706
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:42,518
- Maybe we can pull a plate number.
- No.

707
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,220
I checked everything within
a mile radius. Nada.

708
00:32:45,245 --> 00:32:47,064
Must have grabbed him in a blind spot.

709
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:48,605
Unfortunately,

710
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,564
I think we're dealing with
some pretty crafty bad guys.

711
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:51,460
I...

712
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:53,374
can't... breathe!

713
00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:57,617
Please don't crush him.
We've only just begun.

714
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,277
No. Come on, man. Ask us anything!

715
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:03,461
All right.

716
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:05,727
My face... how did you do it?

717
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:07,805
What?! Well, the wings are one thing,

718
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,407
but my Devil face...
how did you take that?

719
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:13,442
We've never seen you before, man!

720
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:14,409
Yeah, man.

721
00:33:14,434 --> 00:33:16,245
Never heard of you before today.

722
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,805
I just got a name... Daniel LaDoosh...
a pickup point,

723
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,502
and that you got a thing for gerbils.

724
00:33:22,411 --> 00:33:24,877
I suppose you also deny abducting Mr.
Banales

725
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,261
and leaving him to perish
in the desert, do you?

726
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:29,350
He's the client from last week, man!

727
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,552
Right, man.

728
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:32,030
His friend got him the deluxe package.

729
00:33:32,055 --> 00:33:33,780
We did the detail work here,

730
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:35,350
and then our partner Sam picked him up,

731
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,176
took him to the spider
hole for a few hours,

732
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:38,678
and dropped him back off at the hotel.

733
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:39,236
Well, then,

734
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:41,161
it seems your colleague took a detour.

735
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,380
Where does this Sam live?

736
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:43,439
Koreatown!

737
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:45,442
It's a pink building on Leeward.

738
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:48,693
- Apartment?
- 5B, man! 5B!

739
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:50,946
Lovely. Thanks for your help.

740
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:52,526
Hey, man!

741
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,119
Will you let us go, man?

742
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:58,804
So, prints off the key
chain led to Josh.

743
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,460
Right. Tire treads on the
roadkill led to nothing.

744
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:03,210
There's got to be
something we're missing.

745
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:04,902
Maybe Lancaster has something.

746
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:06,742
We're screwed.

747
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:07,656
Or not.

748
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,715
Remember the detective
who found the key chain?

749
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,245
He doesn't exist, at least
not at Lancaster PD.

750
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,870
They only sent patrol
units to the scene.

751
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:16,398
Whoa. You think that was our guy?

752
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:18,539
Killers often return to
the scene of the crime.

753
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:19,398
Which means

754
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:20,423
he wasn't finding evidence.

755
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:21,682
He was trying to steal it.

756
00:34:21,707 --> 00:34:22,698
Should have known.

757
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:23,964
Why should you have known?

758
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,433
Lancaster doesn't know
us, we don't know them.

759
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,621
Look, let's just look through
these photos, try and find him

760
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:30,433
in the background, okay? -Yes,
and then we can nail his ass

761
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,862
with facial recognition software.

762
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:34,554
Here he is.

763
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:36,446
But his back's to us.

764
00:34:37,524 --> 00:34:40,059
You guys... oh, my gosh.

765
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:42,036
I knew... I knew he didn't die in vain.

766
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:44,195
- What?
- Who?

767
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,293
Leo. See, look.

768
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:48,481
There's our suspect,
right, leaving the scene,

769
00:34:48,506 --> 00:34:50,640
walking towards that van.

770
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:53,060
Ryuk Road Crusher tires.

771
00:34:53,127 --> 00:34:54,266
Commercial grade.

772
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,266
That's the van that ran over Leo.

773
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,429
I mean, this pretty much confirms

774
00:34:58,454 --> 00:35:00,133
- that this guy's our killer.
- Okay.

775
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,293
So maybe we can get an ID.

776
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:03,486
Let's run the license plate.

777
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:37,576
Remember me?

778
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,864
It's you.

779
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:44,256
Yes.

780
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:47,358
You know me as the Devil you
so rudely turned into an angel

781
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:48,850
and then dumped in the
middle of the desert,

782
00:35:48,918 --> 00:35:50,477
but I don't know you, so, come on,

783
00:35:50,502 --> 00:35:51,656
introduce yourself.

784
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:53,431
- I'm Sam.
- Yes, yes,

785
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:55,157
I know that, but what are you?

786
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:57,133
And how did my Father
get his hooks into you?

787
00:35:57,158 --> 00:35:58,321
Your father?

788
00:35:58,346 --> 00:36:00,021
Oh, come on, don't be coy.

789
00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:01,351
Let me see.

790
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,944
Unless Dad got jiggy
with some celestial babe

791
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:06,352
after Mum, then you're not my sibling,

792
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:08,882
so... demon. Hmm?

793
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:09,973
Changeling?

794
00:36:09,998 --> 00:36:12,617
I work for an extreme
kidnapping company.

795
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:13,575
Snatched.

796
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,271
Oh, do you now? Well, do you know what?

797
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,998
It doesn't matter what
you are because...

798
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:18,456
this should take care of you.

799
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:19,852
Whoa! Whoa!

800
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,444
Whoa! I... I'm sorry.

801
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:22,930
I'm sorry I left you in the desert.

802
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:24,086
I really am.

803
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:26,559
And I'm sorry I left that
Steve guy there, too.

804
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,489
I... He was just a routine gig.

805
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:30,945
I was gonna swap him for you,

806
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,972
but when I went to pull
you out of the van,

807
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:36,432
you... you had friggin' wings, man!

808
00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:38,776
Well, duh! Wings that you put there

809
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:40,678
at the behest of my Father!

810
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:42,253
- Now stop lying!
- I'm not!

811
00:36:42,278 --> 00:36:44,479
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

812
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:45,910
I swear.

813
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:47,569
And believe me, I didn't want to run,

814
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:49,128
but you scared the hell out of me.

815
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:50,386
Right, you listen, Sammy,

816
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:51,878
I know you're just the messenger,

817
00:36:51,903 --> 00:36:54,805
so why don't you deliver
a message on my behalf?

818
00:36:56,546 --> 00:37:00,200
I define who I am, not Him.

819
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:01,473
Me!

820
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,475
Oh, bloody hell.

821
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:08,933
They're back, aren't they?

822
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:10,659
How?

823
00:37:10,684 --> 00:37:12,536
How are you doing this?

824
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:14,545
Did my Father give you
some kind of totem?

825
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,461
A talisman?

826
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:17,249
- What?
- I'm telling you, I don't...

827
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:19,542
I don't know what's happening.

828
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:21,515
And I don't know your dad.

829
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,452
Unless, is your, is
your dad the Sinnerman?

830
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,780
Quite the opposite. Who's the Sinnerman?

831
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:31,054
That's, that's who,

832
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,001
who hired me to kidnap you.

833
00:37:33,026 --> 00:37:35,979
He's, he's, he's a scary dude.

834
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,423
Huge crime boss. I owed him big time.

835
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:40,349
But because I didn't finish the job,

836
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:42,037
I'm as good as dead now.

837
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:43,195
That's why I was running.

838
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,146
And where do I find this Sinnerman?

839
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:46,529
You don't.

840
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:47,821
He finds you.

841
00:37:47,846 --> 00:37:49,977
Lucifer?

842
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,739
Get up.

843
00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:54,797
Up.

844
00:37:54,822 --> 00:37:57,233
Come on, get up.

845
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:00,195
Put your hands behind your back.

846
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:04,634
- What happened to you?
- I...

847
00:38:06,582 --> 00:38:08,349
I don't know.

848
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:21,946
Decker, it ain't good.

849
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:24,446
Lieutenant, look, I-I know
what you're gonna say.

850
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,983
And, even though we caught our guy,

851
00:38:26,008 --> 00:38:29,040
Lucifer was way out of line,
and I-I don't disagree,

852
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:30,399
but here's what you got to know

853
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:32,158
about our unorthodox methods...

854
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:34,599
- Detective, you...
- I am Lucifer's partner,

855
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:37,024
yes, you're right, but you know what?

856
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:38,550
He's mine, too.

857
00:38:38,575 --> 00:38:42,141
And, for whatever reason,
we make an effective team.

858
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:45,492
And will be even more so
when I stop investing

859
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:48,898
on a, um... personal level.

860
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:50,757
I am here to solve crimes.

861
00:38:50,782 --> 00:38:53,664
Not to see his... his thing

862
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,781
or whatever, which is...

863
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:58,539
not something that you need to know.

864
00:38:58,564 --> 00:39:00,563
Right. Look, point is,

865
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,486
you can say what you want, but
I know I'm a good detective

866
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:06,103
and I have a damn good
solve rate to prove that.

867
00:39:06,198 --> 00:39:07,898
Okay.

868
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:10,830
Okay.

869
00:39:10,855 --> 00:39:12,089
Okay.

870
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:14,565
I just came down here

871
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,791
to let you know that your perp
has been released on bail.

872
00:39:16,816 --> 00:39:17,916
Oh.

873
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:19,589
W-Wait, how is that possible?

874
00:39:19,614 --> 00:39:20,770
Don't know.

875
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:22,170
Friends in high places, I guess.

876
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:23,338
But there's got to be something.

877
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:25,006
I mean, don't-don't you care?

878
00:39:25,074 --> 00:39:26,708
You do what you can, Decker.

879
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:28,376
You can't save them all.

880
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:29,944
Oh.

881
00:39:30,012 --> 00:39:32,655
But, um, good luck with Lucifer's...
thing

882
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,686
or whatever.

883
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,915
Oh, hello, Brother.

884
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:03,419
So, did Remedy cure what ails you?

885
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:05,145
Did her massage make anything

886
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,133
pop out?

887
00:40:06,158 --> 00:40:07,690
Talking about your wings, of course.

888
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:09,825
No, mine are still absent.

889
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:13,452
But yours, on the other hand...

890
00:40:15,268 --> 00:40:17,736
Oh.

891
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:19,402
Lucifer, I'm not angry with you

892
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:21,695
that you somehow got your wings back,

893
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,388
or even that you cut them off again,

894
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:26,270
as foul as that may be.

895
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,125
I'm angry with myself.

896
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:32,305
Because somehow I made you feel

897
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,498
like you couldn't confide in me.

898
00:40:34,523 --> 00:40:37,677
Well, comparing body parts is
never good for the male ego,

899
00:40:37,745 --> 00:40:39,264
especially between brothers.

900
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:41,092
But that's just it, Luci.

901
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:45,393
My ego should never be an issue.

902
00:40:45,518 --> 00:40:47,446
I am an angel.

903
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:50,332
A soldier of God.

904
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:52,492
His favorite son.

905
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,618
Oh, that's gonna be a thing, isn't it?

906
00:40:57,715 --> 00:41:00,650
Listen, Father, He...

907
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:03,003
works in mysterious ways.

908
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:06,477
I was tested once and I failed.

909
00:41:06,502 --> 00:41:08,469
I'm not gonna fail again.

910
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:10,695
Because this time, I have faith.

911
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,232
Excellent.

912
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:16,783
And I suppose this won't bother you.

913
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:24,449
But you...

914
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:26,668
you cut them off.

915
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,510
I did, but the pesky things
seem to be a bit more tenacious

916
00:41:29,535 --> 00:41:31,115
this time around.

917
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,589
Well, like I said, I have faith.

918
00:41:33,614 --> 00:41:35,882
I'm sure it's all a part of God's plan.

919
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,434
Yes!

920
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,761
If you mean his plan to
continually manipulate

921
00:41:39,786 --> 00:41:41,820
and control me, then agreed.

922
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:43,126
Because, by the way,

923
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:45,337
he didn't just give my wings back,

924
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:48,090
he took my Devil face as well.

925
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:52,176
Luci, do you realize what this means?

926
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:54,879
Perhaps Father is trying
to show you that,

927
00:41:54,904 --> 00:41:56,605
that you've been forgiven.

928
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,898
What if I don't want His forgiveness?

929
00:41:58,942 --> 00:42:02,254
But, Brother, if you can be redeemed,

930
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:04,356
that means that anyone can.

931
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:08,023
Now, isn't that divine?

932
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:14,032
I'm not sure that this is
divinity at work here.

933
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:22,104
Have you ever heard of
someone named the Sinnerman?

934
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:25,522
The Sinnerman?

935
00:42:28,057 --> 00:42:29,724
No.

936
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,387
Why?

937
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:35,928
That's who kidnapped me.

938
00:42:46,945 --> 00:42:48,417
At first, I thought it was a...

939
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:50,076
an emissary on Earth

940
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,953
working on Dad's behalf, but
then, the more I think about it,

941
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:53,912
the more I think...

942
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:58,229
maybe this isn't our Father
who art in Heaven at all.

943
00:43:04,087 --> 00:43:05,818
But something much,

944
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:08,420
much darker.
