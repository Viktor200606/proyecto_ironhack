1
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:21,252
I never felt like that before.

2
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:23,841
That was...

3
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,175
Exhilarating.

4
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:29,408
That man was so terrible.

5
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,010
Truly evil.

6
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:34,474
We made him pay.

7
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:36,119
Please.

8
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:37,979
Who can we punish next?

9
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,025
I want to feel like that again.

10
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:47,530
Yes, it's quite the rush,
finally being who I'm meant to be.

11
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:53,078
But, sadly, my dear, criminals
don't line up to be punished.

12
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:58,873
So that's why you work with the LAPD.

13
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,752
It all makes so much sense now.

14
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:05,539
You use them to find the bad guys.

15
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,843
Well, I want in.

16
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:12,844
Ah!

17
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:14,625
- Do you now, darling?
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,435
Maybe we could do it together.

19
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:22,065
Find the worst of the worst
and give them what they deserve.

20
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,532
So, Julian, you admit to...

21
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:36,285
human trafficking and to
the murder of Gary Van Blunt

22
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:38,079
and officer John Reyes.

23
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,260
Yes.

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,626
You're going to jail for a
really long time, cop killer.

25
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:45,922
- At least I'll be safe there.
- What?

26
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:49,233
If you didn't break your
back falling down a hill,

27
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,550
we need to know about that now.

28
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:51,718
I fell down the hill.

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,848
I f... fell down the
hill, I sw... I swear!

30
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:57,306
Chloe.

31
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:01,477
What's up?

32
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,564
Julian's reaction.

33
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,816
Does it look familiar to you?

34
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,859
- Huh?
- Like people we've seen before

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,361
after a certain consultant
has been left alone with them.

36
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,573
What do you mean?

37
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:14,240
- I think Lucifer did this.
- That's crazy.

38
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:16,576
You know what's crazy? How
much Lucifer gets away with.

39
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:17,702
I'm sick of it. Aren't you?

40
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,038
Lucifer wouldn't do this.
He wouldn't go this far.

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,081
He would never take
justice into his own hands?

42
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,417
Especially as a cop was killed
because of his stupid recklessness.

43
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,419
You need to cut him some slack.

44
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:29,674
You have had a target
on his back ever since...

45
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:33,099
well...

46
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:34,512
Charlotte.

47
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:40,308
I'm just not sure if you're
looking at this objectively.

48
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:41,881
That's all.

49
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:43,188
Like you are?

50
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,269
I could understand Lucifer
callously ignoring our duty

51
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:58,834
to keep humans and the divine separate.

52
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:00,244
But you?

53
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,493
How could you do this?

54
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:02,789
A child...

55
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,875
with a human?

56
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:05,254
Wonderful human.

57
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:09,462
I know how difficult this
must be for you. All right?

58
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:11,422
I used to be just like you.

59
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,969
Looking down on humans
as if they were ants.

60
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:18,139
But we need to realize
that we are not above them.

61
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:20,306
I am above them.

62
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:22,235
But you...

63
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:24,680
You don't even have your
powers anymore, do you?

64
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:27,771
No, I can no longer
slow time and I'm glad.

65
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,525
My powers, they kept me at a distance,

66
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:32,798
kept me disconnected from humanity.

67
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,422
And I think that's why they're gone now.

68
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,266
Because I don't want that anymore.

69
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:37,852
You were the one who taught me

70
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:40,451
that celestials and
humans need to be separate.

71
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:44,664
Yes, Remy, I did, and
now I am telling you

72
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,792
that I was wrong.

73
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,969
Let me show you.

74
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,394
Hey, Ella, who do we have?

75
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,727
Hey, Chloe.

76
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:10,106
Victim died from a gunshot straight
to the head up on that bridge.

77
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:12,275
But apparently murdering wasn't enough.

78
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:14,819
So they tossed his body over
the bridge like day-old garbage.

79
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,947
Broke nearly every bone in
his body from the looks of it.

80
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:19,238
Hmm.

81
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:21,909
Are you okay?

82
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:24,078
Just death. People die.

83
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,288
Mm-hmm.

84
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,457
Well, we just deal with it.

85
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,251
Anyhow, what do we know about this guy?

86
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:31,419
Sam Zofrelli.

87
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:34,088
Rap sheet filled with
drug possession charges.

88
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,382
Oh! We also found traces of cocaine

89
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,509
in his pockets, but
no sign of drug use.

90
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,219
So I'm thinking probably dealer.

91
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:43,806
- So you think this was about drugs?
- Maybe. Pockets were empty.

92
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:46,100
Keys, wallet, all gone.

93
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,666
But the body was here for hours

94
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,979
so could have been taken
by anyone brave enough

95
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,647
to frisk a corpse this effed-up.

96
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:53,482
But why throw a body over a bridge

97
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:54,650
that's already dead?

98
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:55,985
Where's Lucifer?

99
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:58,948
Oh, he's been ignoring me actually.

100
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,950
Oh, he's with Eve.

101
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:05,828
Yes, probably with Eve.
What you think of her?

102
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,885
I think that she's rubbing off on
him and not necessarily in a good way.

103
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,545
Good morning, Detective.

104
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:16,428
Please don't tell me she's behind me.

105
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:17,926
She's behind you.

106
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:21,632
Hello.

107
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:22,803
Lucifer.

108
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,264
This is a crime scene. No
visitors. No offense, Eve.

109
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:26,783
Eve wants the same thing we do.

110
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,266
- Catch a killer.
- Yes.

111
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:30,580
I am here to learn from you, Chloe.

112
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:34,147
I want to know everything there is
to know about catching criminals.

113
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,064
Especially the very, very bad ones.

114
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,885
Can I talk to you, alone?

115
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:42,306
Of course.

116
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,141
This isn't gonna work.

117
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:49,969
I agree. A gingham pocket square can

118
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:51,619
be a bit aggressive, but I'm feeling it.

119
00:05:51,622 --> 00:05:54,212
- No. Eve being here, not OK.
- Why not?

120
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,964
You can't just join a
case for the fun of it.

121
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,892
We are solving a
murder. This is serious.

122
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:01,758
Oh, I agree. Very serious.

123
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,694
If that's how you feel,
I completely understand.

124
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,140
Where are you going?

125
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,689
If you don't want us here,
we'll find the killer on our own.

126
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,020
You can't do that.

127
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:13,051
Oh, yes we can.

128
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,317
Okay, fine.

129
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,694
Fine. Eve can ride
along just for this case.

130
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:21,862
Exciting!

131
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:26,411
This is going to be so much fun.

132

133
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:38,354
Lucifer, this guy looks really guilty.

134
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:40,986
What about this guy?

135
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:43,594
That's one mean looking face.

136
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:49,265
- We should punish them.
- One criminal at a time, dear.

137
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,146
Decker.

138
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:57,066
No, I will not accept his call.

139
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,320
Who was that?

140
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,780
Nobody.

141
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:07,827
Ah-ah-ah!

142
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:11,495
Lucifer's bringing his
girlfriend on cases now, huh?

143
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,133
She's actually really sweet.

144
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:14,749
Anyway, you know what?

145
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,626
Why not do whatever makes you happy?

146
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:20,338
Because any second, bam! You can get hit

147
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,242
by a chunk of blue ice from an airplane

148
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:25,914
or get blown up into a million
pieces by some crazed killer.

149
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:28,621
Or you could mysteriously
break your spinal cord

150
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:31,406
and become, you know, paralyzed.

151
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,833
Yeah.

152
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:36,379
Is anybody investigating what
happened to Julian McCaffrey?

153
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:38,714
Nobody's buying his "I fell
down the hill" story, right?

154
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:41,217
He didn't file any charges, so
there's nothing to investigate.

155
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,969
Even if we wanted to,

156
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:46,516
remember that house he lived in? It's
probably been professionally cleaned.

157
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,557
You're right.

158
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,812
You're absolutely right.

159
00:07:53,648 --> 00:07:56,107
Oh, that's Daniel.

160
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,566
He's a douche again.

161
00:07:57,568 --> 00:07:59,485
Oh, shall we punish him too?

162
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,029
Believe me, his existence
is punishment enough.

163
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,786
Hey, Ella. What do we have?

164
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:11,747
Well, we still don't know why Sam's
body was tossed off the bridge.

165
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:14,669
Because the killer is a maniacal
monster who needs to be taken down.

166
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,295
Er... maybe.

167
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,590
But I did discover that the killer

168
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:21,590
pistol-whipped poor Sam before he died.

169
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,801
- Sounds like it could be personal.
- And aggressive.

170
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,398
And cruel.

171
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:29,473
And a mistake, because I
was able to recover something

172
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,309
from the gun marks on his face.

173
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,205
Gold flakes.

174
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,062
- Gold flakes?
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:38,107
In there? That's amazing.

176
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:41,402
Ah! Well, you know,
I'm just doing my job.

177
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:44,071
Do you get to be there
for the punishment too?

178
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:46,282
Er, no.

179
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:48,366
Golden gun.

180
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,245
It's unique and it sounds familiar.

181
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:53,039
Yes, Roger Moore's Bond films.

182
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,752
Perhaps our killer's Scaramanga,
the man with three nipples.

183
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:57,611
Maybe.

184
00:08:57,614 --> 00:08:59,962
Ella, do you remember
there was a hitman...

185
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:02,631
or something who carries a golden
pistol. Do you remember that?

186
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,592
Ah, let me see.

187
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,385
Er... ooh, right here.

188
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:09,180
Greg Grabowski...

189
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,058
and goes by the nickname "Pony Boy".

190
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,393
Pony Boy? Stay gold indeed.

191
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:16,937
And you're never able to pin
him down because he's so good.

192
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:18,814
But if this wasn't a
hit and it was personal,

193
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,858
it would explain why he was so sloppy.

194
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,901
He sounds terrible.

195
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:25,073
- Let's go punish him!
- You mean, bring him to justice.

196
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:27,033
That's what I said.

197
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,911
Oh! That clears that up. Come on.

198
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,583
When I was a newborn demon...

199
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,920
I was smaller than my opponents.

200
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:41,339
But I was fast.

201
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:45,093
So I used my speed, kept low...

202
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,011
and always went for the major arteries.

203
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:52,306
With my first vanquished
foe on his knees,

204
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:54,642
I slit my blade across his throat.

205
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:58,398
I felt the heat from his
blood dripping down my face.

206
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:05,277
And then a stranger heat in my loins.

207
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,031
Okay.

208
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:10,692
When I mentioned that
the baby could hear

209
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,201
everything from inside the womb

210
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:14,495
I imagined introducing
him to things like

211
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:16,050
classical music...

212
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:18,222
and stories...

213
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:23,434
that aren't about graphic murders.

214
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:26,732
Why would you want to hear a
story not about graphic murder?

215
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:29,804
We can talk about that later.

216
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,138
- I have to go to work.
- Great.

217
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,641
Give me a second to get my knives.

218
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,771
Maze, sweetie.

219
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:42,148
You can't come to work with me.

220
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,192
I have to!

221
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,307
Do you know all the things that could

222
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,111
happen to you or your baby out there?

223
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,072
Er... heartburn?

224
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,868
You could get gunned down in
a drive-by shooting, Linda.

225
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,496
Or kidnapped by a cartel
who use women as drug mules,

226
00:10:57,498 --> 00:11:00,832
not to mention what an angel baby
will fetch on the black market.

227
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:01,917
How comforting.

228
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,295
You said I'm part of this family, Linda.

229
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,880
So I'm going to protect you.

230
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,299
Maze, the people I am
seeing this afternoon

231
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,095
are a vegan chef who
compulsively shoplifts...

232
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,221
and a record producer who wets the bed.

233
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:15,681
- But I...
- Maze...

234
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:17,018
I don't need protecting.

235
00:11:36,537 --> 00:11:37,912
What you doing?

236
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,290
Oh, hey. Er...

237
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,919
I paid off the cleaning
crew in Julian's house.

238
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,670
What? I'm looking for
something in his trash to prove

239
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,716
that somebody was there
the night he was paralyzed.

240
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:53,971
Well, I don't know about any of
that, but I can help if you want.

241
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,015
Lucifer's brand.

242
00:11:57,018 --> 00:11:58,890
What did you say?

243
00:11:58,893 --> 00:12:00,538
Er, nothing.

244
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,319
I, uh,

245
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,729
found what I needed.

246
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:08,069
Oh, er... Don't worry about
me, Dan. I can clean up.

247
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,325
Damn, these guys are huge.

248
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:18,035
We can take them, right, honey?

249
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,037
Of course I can, darling, I'm the Devil.

250
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,154
In that case, I hope
this guy we're after

251
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:24,250
is the biggest, meanest one there is.

252
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:25,459
We don't want that.

253
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:26,456
I do.

254
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,213
Makes it more satisfying
when Lucifer beats them up.

255
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,298
We don't beat people up in
the middle of the street.

256
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,093
Oh. Do we take them back
to Lucifer's penthouse?

257
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:36,595
Anyway. We don't beat
people up anywhere.

258
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:39,181
Unless they resist and
then it's Devil by TKO.

259
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:41,435
Don't worry, they always resist.

260
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,104
There's Pony Boy.

261
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,107
Look at those arms.

262
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:49,610
Let's not get carried away.

263
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:56,156
Greg "Pony Boy" Grabowski,
LAPD. You're under arrest

264
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:57,616
- for the murder...
- Okay.

265
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:59,243
- What?
- What?

266
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,453
What was that? I thought
they always resisted.

267
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,666
Look. I've been through
this a hundred times.

268
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,125
I'm just gonna wait for my lawyer.

269
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:07,994
Lucifer, you should torture the truth

270
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,462
out of him until his lawyer shows up.

271
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:12,600
Eve, that's not how this works.

272
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:16,427
Everybody calm down. Eve just
wants to see the devil do his thing.

273
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,229
And there is one thing
you haven't seen me do.

274
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:19,765
Tell me...

275
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:21,934
My little Pony Boy,

276
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,145
what is it you desire?

277
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:25,770
I...

278
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:29,317
I wish...

279
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:31,317
I wish...

280
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,529
wish my boss had let me kill Sam.

281
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:36,130
- Oh.
- Hmm.

282
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:38,824
Sorry, darling, we can't
punish him after all.

283
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:39,992
The man's innocent.

284
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:41,560
Are you crazy?

285
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:44,388
Watching the devil
do this thing is so...

286
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,705
hot.

287
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,293
So you wished your
boss let you kill him.

288
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,330
Then who's your boss
and if it wasn't you,

289
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,713
who used your golden gun to do it?

290
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,294
Lawyer. Now.

291
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,622
I mean...

292
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,684
Turn around.

293
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:08,348
It's fun, isn't it?

294
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:10,677
Hey, Chloe.

295
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,568
I know that look.

296
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,028
You found something.

297
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,404
I hope so.

298
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:20,032
Hitmen are often paid
as corporate employees

299
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:21,825
through shell companies
to hide the money.

300
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,329
But it also sometimes means that
they get the corporate perks.

301
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,165
Like covering their gym membership fees.

302
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,751
So who's paying for Pony
Boy to get so jacked?

303
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:33,587
It looks like it all tracks
back to Jacob Tiernan here.

304
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:34,965
That paralyzed dude's dad?

305
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,675
Does this have something
to do with that case?

306
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,260
Tiernan's son shows up
paralyzed from the chest down.

307
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:42,721
Then this guy dies.
So it has to be, right?

308
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:45,683
I think Sam's bones were
broken before he was killed

309
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,102
in the exact same
spot that Julian's was.

310
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,478
Julian McCaffrey?

311
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,772
- Yeah.
- What does this have to do with him?

312
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:54,316
Maybe Tiernan thought that
Sam broke Julian's back.

313
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:56,443
Normally he'd hire Pony
Boy to do his dirty work,

314
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:59,154
- but it's his son so...
- He wanted to enact revenge himself

315
00:14:59,156 --> 00:15:01,115
and borrowed Pony Boy's gun to do it.

316
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,075
- Yes.
- I'll get you the ME report.

317
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:04,256
Great.

318
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:09,498
Hey. Luce.

319
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,501
I did that.

320
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:14,296
I broke Julian's back.
Tiernan killed an innocent man.

321
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:16,424
What does that mean?

322
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:20,843
It means, my dear,
that now more than ever

323
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:23,222
that monster needs to be punished.

324
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,308
Mr. Tiernan, I don't know if you heard

325
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,561
but a drug dealer was
killed this morning.

326
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,273
What does that have to do with me?

327
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,816
Well, that's the interesting part.

328
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:39,695
He had the exact same
spinal injury as your son.

329
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:43,407
So it would seem that possibly
someone is out for revenge.

330
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,160
My son worked with a lot of bad people.

331
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:49,079
In fact, Julian wasn't
exactly a good person himself,

332
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,822
which is why I had to
excise him from my business.

333
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:56,503
You... you love your children,
but at a certain point

334
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:58,883
- you have to let them...
- Stand on their own two legs.

335
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:03,551
Mr Tiernan, do you know a
man named Greg Grabowski?

336
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:07,431
Goes by the colorful moniker "Pony Boy".

337
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,081
No.

338
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:10,767
Hmm. That's odd,

339
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,562
because one of your
companies pays his bills.

340
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:16,273
I have a lot of companies paying
a lot of people a lot of money.

341
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,150
I don't keep track of every penny.

342
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:20,652
You kept track of your
son, though, didn't you?

343
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:23,447
Which is why you consistently
bailed him out of jail.

344
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,940
Always getting him out of trouble.

345
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,785
He never learned, did he?

346
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,290
In fact, some might say it's your fault

347
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:33,456
he became a killer, a human trafficker.

348
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,355
A broken little doll.

349
00:16:38,672 --> 00:16:40,923
My son had a lot of friends.

350
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,043
Maybe one of them decided to make

351
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,761
the piece of garbage
who crippled him pay.

352
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:47,316
Really?

353
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,681
Because I had a little chat with Julian

354
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:52,184
right before he shot a
police officer in cold blood.

355
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:55,979
He said that you were an
even worse person than he was.

356
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,566
Mm. That must make you a true monster.

357
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:02,402
Unless you have actual cause
to charge me with something,

358
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:03,862
this little chat is over.

359
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:06,531
Oh, I'm the devil, Tiernan,

360
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:08,160
I have all the cause I need.

361
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,495
Detective, I think it's time you left

362
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,832
so I can do what I do
best and punish this man.

363
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,191
Get out.

364
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:19,336
Lucifer. He will be punished.

365
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:25,133
Lucifer. Lucifer, stop.

366
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:27,427
Lucifer, do it.

367
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:28,762
Get out!

368
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,389
Detective...

369
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:32,183
leave.

370
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:33,691
Stop.

371
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,292
This isn't over.

372
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:57,124
Tiernan killed Sam,
but we have no proof.

373
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,132
So?

374
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:00,252
So Tiernan's gonna
double his legal defense

375
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:02,667
now that you've hulked
out in his office.

376
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,255
Devil is as devil does.

377
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:08,218
What about this other guy? Uh, Pony Boy.

378
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,861
Pony Boy already posted bail.

379
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:11,680
Or Tiernan posted it for him.

380
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:16,181
You're saying that we don't
get to punish anybody?

381
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:18,519
Honey... you promised.

382
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,283
Can we... give us a moment. Thanks.

383
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:23,400
What the hell is up with you?

384
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,611
I finally figured out
who I am, that's all.

385
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:28,115
Lucifer, this is not who you are.

386
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:30,826
I think Eve is a bad influence on you.

387
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:33,869
This has nothing to do with her.

388
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:36,622
It's who I am, I punish people.

389
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:41,084
So do I, but like I said, there is
a right way and there is a wrong way.

390
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,337
What makes you the
authority on right and wrong?

391
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,756
I'm a cop and it's the law.

392
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,384
Well, I'm the devil.

393
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:50,545
I ruled Hell.

394
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,555
Bad people were sent to me so
they could get what they deserved.

395
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:57,478
It is my job to do the same here
on Earth because when I don't...

396
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,193
When I don't, bad things happen.

397
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:10,324
That is why I broke Julian's back.

398
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:17,998
And that is why I won't let
Tiernan get away with it.

399
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,668
You broke Julian's back.

400
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,754
What am I supposed to
do with that, Lucifer?

401
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:27,967
It's not your place to
do anything about it.

402
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:30,321
Then why?

403
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:34,680
Why ask me to leave when we
were in Tiernan's office?

404
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:37,265
You were going to hurt him
and you wanted me to leave

405
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,059
because you knew it was wrong.

406
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:41,812
No. Because you've made it plainly clear

407
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,983
that you can't handle who I am.

408
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:02,708
Mr Tiernan, the cops are back.

409
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,671
- I have nothing more to say.
- I'm here about your son.

410
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:11,427
Thank you, Margaret.

411
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:17,725
He didn't just fall down that hill.

412
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:21,520
Someone deliberately broke his back.

413
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:23,439
And I know who it was.

414
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,565
Why haven't you arrested this man?

415
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:29,026
I don't have enough proof
to put him in jail...

416
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,902
but he needs to be
accountable for his actions,

417
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,322
and I know you're a powerful man...

418
00:20:33,824 --> 00:20:34,992
a man who ruins his enemies.

419
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,536
I'm listening.

420
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,371
Look.

421
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:46,086
You could finally give him a taste
of the punishment he deserves.

422
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:48,464
What is this man's name?

423
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:51,884
Lucifer Morningstar.

424
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:59,890
Since we know the murder was personal,

425
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,725
I looked back over the autopsy report

426
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,270
and I was hoping we could
find spit or urine or something

427
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:06,688
we could use to track DNA.

428
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,607
It's amazing how many dudes do that.

429
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,317
I really don't get why.

430
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,985
Do you get why?

431
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:13,653
Anyway, no luck there,

432
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:17,491
but I did notice that one
of his fingers was broken.

433
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,659
Still post-mortem,
but not from the fall.

434
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:22,412
It looks like someone broke
his finger to pry a ring off.

435
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,873
Probably whoever stole
all his money and drugs.

436
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,084
Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

437
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,670
Er, you okay?

438
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:33,342
Do you think there is such
a thing as celestial justice?

439
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:37,761
Because if celestial justice does exist,

440
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,471
like heaven and hell,

441
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:43,102
then what we've been doing
here, say arresting criminals...

442
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,020
why even bother?

443
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:50,651
I know you're religious and I thought
you may have some thoughts on it.

444
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:55,654
Well, I was religious

445
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:57,030
- and...
- Oh.

446
00:21:57,032 --> 00:22:00,867
...when I used to
believe in all that stuff,

447
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:04,329
I really thought that
I was doing my part

448
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:06,498
to uphold right and wrong on Earth

449
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,376
and everyone would get
their comeuppance eventually,

450
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:11,213
but we still needed to keep people safe.

451
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:15,715
But now I believe we
are all anybody's got

452
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:18,301
and if we don't hold people
accountable, nobody will

453
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,179
because heaven and
hell, they don't exist.

454
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,014
But what if they do exist?

455
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:25,225
- Say, the devil.
- He's not real.

456
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:26,560
Chloe, look at the Bible.

457
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:28,353
It is so full of contradictions.

458
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,480
Fine. Take the devil, for example.

459
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,818
The devil's supposed
to be pure evil, right?

460
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,610
But he started out as an angel.

461
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:39,823
You can't start good
and the turn all evil.

462
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,741
I mean, that's what
they want us to believe?

463
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:42,619
You're right.

464
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:44,872
He's an angel.

465
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:48,250
No, my point is that it's all bullshit.

466
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,670
I...

467
00:22:57,426 --> 00:23:00,302
This is where I came with
the mother of my child

468
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:02,804
right after we found out that
we were going to be parents.

469
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:04,266
We both realized...

470
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:07,475
just how wonderful it would be.

471
00:23:07,477 --> 00:23:09,269
All I see is weakness.

472
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:10,369
They're pathetic.

473
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:14,041
If you raise your son surrounded by
them, he will become like they are.

474
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:17,360
They may be flawed, yes, but so are we

475
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,018
and flawed doesn't mean weak.

476
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:22,153
Sounds like something
a weak person would say.

477
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:25,974
Amenadiel, I just want
the best for your child.

478
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:27,177
So do I.

479
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,876
I'm taking the baby.

480
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,713
No, Remy, you're not.

481
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,797
I'll never let you
find him or his mother.

482
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,090
Too late.

483
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:40,884
I picked up the scent this morning.

484
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,261
I've listened to you out
of respect, Amenadiel,

485
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:44,930
for what you once were.

486
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:47,418
But I'm convinced more than
ever of what I need to do.

487
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:49,433
Remy.

488
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:51,978
I won't let you take my child.

489
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,438
Try and stop me.

490
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:42,404
Oh, my. Maze!

491
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:44,349
What is it?

492
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:46,365
I thought someone was following me.

493
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:49,619
- Who?
- You. You are following me.

494
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,745
Why are you following me?

495
00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:52,580
I'm protecting you when
you leave the house.

496
00:24:52,582 --> 00:24:54,666
Don't you have anything else to do?

497
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:56,376
Like hunting bounty.

498
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:57,794
I cleared my entire schedule.

499
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,462
I am never leaving your side.

500
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,840
I don't need you to always be around.

501
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:04,092
I need you to back off.

502
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:06,023
But...

503
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:08,515
how else am I supposed
to protect our baby?

504
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,804
Our?

505
00:25:12,686 --> 00:25:14,969
Maze, this isn't...

506
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,148
I just need some space. Okay?

507
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:21,361
Sure. Since we're here, do you
want to grab a coconut water?

508
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:38,626
I will never let you
anywhere near Linda or my son!

509
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:41,254
Who's gonna stop me? You?

510
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:43,008
There's only one way to find out.

511
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:54,058
Can't have anyone saying
it wasn't a fair fight.

512
00:25:58,921 --> 00:26:00,879
I'm not going to let
you raise this baby here,

513
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:03,389
where everything special
about him will be leached away.

514
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,159
He will be special
because he's raised here!

515
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,029
With his family.

516
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,451
Funny, I thought I was your family.

517
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:22,365
You are my family, Remy.

518
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:23,492
But this is my son!

519
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:45,460
Earth hasn't made me weak, Remy.

520
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,733
It's made me stronger.

521
00:26:57,889 --> 00:26:59,891
A true warrior admits their defeat.

522
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:02,912
So you'll respect my wishes?

523
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:06,174
I will... reluctantly.

524
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:09,050
But be careful, brother.

525
00:27:09,052 --> 00:27:11,218
I still fear one day...

526
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:13,014
you'll come to regret your decision.

527
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,730
Hey, Linda.

528
00:27:22,732 --> 00:27:26,319
So I'm just calling because
I'm a little worried...

529
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,655
about Lucifer, and
thought that you might know

530
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:33,119
what's going on with him. When you
get a chance, call me back. Thanks.

531
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:35,912
What's wrong with Lucifer?

532
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,125
Is he okay?

533
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,503
Yeah, Lucifer's okay.

534
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,254
I think he's just...

535
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:48,423
He's just going through
something right now.

536
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:51,426
Don't you always say that when
somebody's going through something,

537
00:27:51,428 --> 00:27:53,346
that's when they need
their friends the most?

538
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,434
You know what? You're right, monkey.

539
00:27:58,643 --> 00:27:59,823
But...

540
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:04,733
I'm just not sure that I'm the
friend that Lucifer needs right now.

541
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,364
You do your homework.

542
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,661
Could tie Tiernan to the
anchor of one of his ships.

543
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:21,772
- Mm-hmm.
- Or a million paper cuts

544
00:28:21,775 --> 00:28:23,583
from his own hundred-dollar bills.

545
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:24,542
Great.

546
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:26,252
Oh, no, actually...

547
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:27,882
I know a man who owns an emu farm.

548
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:29,881
They're surprisingly
bloodthirsty animals.

549
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:32,884
Just pick a punishment and
let's go. What's the hold-up?

550
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:35,096
All in good time, my darling.

551
00:28:36,056 --> 00:28:39,494
You know how satisfying delayed
gratification is in bed, right?

552
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:42,894
I think you're stalling.

553
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:45,563
What?

554
00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:46,650
Because of Chloe.

555
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:49,319
Look...

556
00:28:51,238 --> 00:28:52,790
I like Chloe.

557
00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:54,739
I do, she's great.

558
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:56,603
But to be honest...

559
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:00,662
I think she's a bad influence on you.

560
00:29:00,664 --> 00:29:02,249
Oh.

561
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:05,250
This has nothing to
do with the detective.

562
00:29:05,252 --> 00:29:07,377
It's just better when
you punish them properly.

563
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:08,579
Lucifer...

564
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,092
I just want you to be the
best version of yourself.

565
00:29:14,094 --> 00:29:15,176
You know?

566
00:29:15,178 --> 00:29:18,658
That devil I met in the garden.

567
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:24,811
I held myself back for so long
and I can see you doing the same...

568
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:26,204
because of her.

569
00:29:27,158 --> 00:29:31,079
I just think she might be a
little too involved in your life.

570
00:29:31,695 --> 00:29:33,780
That is preposterous.

571
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:36,656
Hi, Lucifer.

572
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:37,772
Who's this?

573
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:40,245
That is the detective's offspring.

574
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,497
You have a piano up here?

575
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:45,081
Yes, but no! Please!

576
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,625
Please don't touch that. I
don't know where you've been.

577
00:29:47,627 --> 00:29:49,127
Look at all those books!

578
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:50,939
Yes, emphasis on the look...

579
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:53,047
Whoa, a pony.

580
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:55,337
Be careful with that, that
was a gift from Napoleon.

581
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:58,900
- Do you have a pet?
- Yeah... No, not really.

582
00:29:58,903 --> 00:30:01,595
You have stairs to get to your bedroom.

583
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,559
Like a princess.

584
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:06,102
Like a what?

585
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:09,105
How dare you?

586
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,192
You have a hot tub on your balcony?

587
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:14,280
No! Please don't jump
on that, it's Italian.

588
00:30:14,283 --> 00:30:16,404
This is the coolest place ever!

589
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:18,114
Does your mother know you're...

590
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,658
Does your mother know you're here?

591
00:30:21,244 --> 00:30:22,784
Yes?

592
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,868
Well, what are you doing here?

593
00:30:24,871 --> 00:30:27,083
I came here to make sure you're okay.

594
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:31,241
My mom said you needed a friend.

595
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:37,927
But it looks like you already have one.

596
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,673
Hi.

597
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:41,814
I'm Eve.

598
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:50,940
Hey. Trixie ready?

599
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,276
Trix, Dad's here.

600
00:30:54,665 --> 00:30:55,904
How's the case going?

601
00:30:58,073 --> 00:30:59,866
We know who the killer is but...

602
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:02,033
we don't have proof.

603
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:03,117
Who is it?

604
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,622
Er, Julian's dad, Jacob Tiernan.

605
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:08,747
Jacob Tiernan.

606
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,333
What, he killed somebody?

607
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,252
He thought that Sam was the one
who broke Julian's back, so...

608
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:15,963
- Simple revenge motive.
- You're sure about that?

609
00:31:15,965 --> 00:31:17,759
I mean, I didn't think
he was capable of...

610
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:20,385
- of that.
- Trix.

611
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:21,469
Trix?

612
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:22,578
Come on.

613
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:25,642
Dan.

614
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,810
Dan!

615
00:31:28,812 --> 00:31:30,064
Yeah?

616
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:35,402
- Trixie snuck out and went to Lucifer's.
- What?

617
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:37,735
Well...

618
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:39,213
We've got to go find her.

619
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:40,490
Now.

620
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:45,370
Where do you live?

621
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:48,245
Here.

622
00:31:48,248 --> 00:31:51,499
- Where are you from?
- Far away. I came here for Lucifer.

623
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,533
Keep the commentary to yourself, lady.

624
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,066
- Have you ever been married?
- Yes, it didn't work out.

625
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:57,695
- How come?
- We weren't right for each other.

626
00:31:57,697 --> 00:31:59,632
- What do you do for work?
- I don't.

627
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,416
Pretty much just get to be me.

628
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,971
Well, that's kind of cool.

629
00:32:03,974 --> 00:32:06,116
- Favorite color?
- Red. What's yours?

630
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,973
I'm asking the questions.

631
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:11,728
Would you excuse me whilst I do
something less mind-numbingly boring

632
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,205
like color-sort my suits?

633
00:32:17,193 --> 00:32:19,738
Are you the kind of friend
Lucifer needs right now?

634
00:32:23,116 --> 00:32:24,431
I hope so.

635
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,954
I care about him very much.

636
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:35,501
Oh, my... Lucifer!

637
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:38,002
I didn't think there'd be
anyone else here, but...

638
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,673
can't have any witnesses.

639
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:42,424
Oh, please...

640
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:46,179
Let's go! Let's go!

641
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,484
What are you?

642
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:04,781
Tiernan sent you, didn't he?

643
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:05,990
Yeah.

644
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:07,992
Where is she?

645
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:09,119
Where's Trixie?

646
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:11,697
She's safe. She's through there.

647
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:15,958
Mommy! Daddy!

648
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,619
Sorry.

649
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:21,299
Monkey, you're okay.

650
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,994
You're okay.

651
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:28,306
I love you, honey.

652
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:49,244
I hope you know I would...

653
00:33:50,703 --> 00:33:53,498
I would do anything to
protect that little urchin.

654
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:58,458
I know.

655
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:01,336
I also know what you're
thinking of doing to Tiernan.

656
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:03,453
Especially now.

657
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:06,662
And you, detective.

658
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,516
Don't you want to punish him?
He almost killed your child.

659
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,808
Yes.

660
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,725
I do, yeah.

661
00:34:14,727 --> 00:34:17,311
But I'm gonna do it
by following the rules

662
00:34:17,313 --> 00:34:19,312
because...

663
00:34:19,315 --> 00:34:22,486
I believe in right and wrong and...

664
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:24,617
and deep down I think that...

665
00:34:26,155 --> 00:34:27,282
you do too.

666
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,236
You're the devil.

667
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:36,165
But you're also an angel.

668
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:40,712
I'm not sure that I am an angel anymore.

669
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:42,088
What do you mean?

670
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,634
After I killed Pierce when
my devil face returned...

671
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,888
I never checked to see if
my wings were still there.

672
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:52,515
I still haven't.

673
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:56,017
Afraid that they're gone.

674
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:57,228
For good reason.

675
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,149
Well, you know...

676
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:03,818
I think you should look.

677
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,573
Maybe you'll be surprised
at what you find.

678
00:35:11,534 --> 00:35:12,911
The police are done.

679
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:24,172
Thank you.

680
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:27,091
Thank you for Trixie.

681
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:29,928
You're welcome.

682
00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:44,400
We're going to get this guy, right?

683
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,569
I mean...

684
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,445
we've been looking for
the worst of the worst.

685
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,782
Here it is.

686
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:55,954
You're right.

687
00:35:57,538 --> 00:36:00,208
It's time for Tiernan to
get what he deserves, but...

688
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:03,586
I need to do this on my own.

689
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:06,337
It's important to me.

690
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,008
Okay.

691
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,556
You know, I...

692
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,234
I only want us...

693
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:21,368
you...

694
00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:23,111
to be happy.

695
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:38,845
We have you dead to
rights on attempted murder.

696
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:41,706
So if you don't help us take down
who really killed Sam Zofrelli...

697
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:44,375
Well. It was your golden
gun used on the murder

698
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:46,876
so you might be looking
pretty damn good for that, too.

699
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:52,049
Look, I love Julian.

700
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:54,176
That's why I wanted to
be the one to kill Sam.

701
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,387
But Julian's an idiot.

702
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:58,307
He gets into trouble all the time...

703
00:36:59,058 --> 00:37:00,474
owed Sam a bunch of money.

704
00:37:00,476 --> 00:37:03,644
Is that why Tiernan thought Sam
was the one to break Julian's spine?

705
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,064
Tiernan wouldn't give Julian
any money to pay back Sam.

706
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:09,859
So Julian had to give
Sam whatever he could,

707
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:11,902
his car, his watch,

708
00:37:11,904 --> 00:37:13,070
family heirlooms.

709
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:14,157
Family heirlooms?

710
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,198
Yeah.

711
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,369
It pissed Tiernan off,
but he still loved the kid.

712
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,494
He's his son after all.

713
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:22,288
But even after all that,

714
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,623
Julian still couldn't come up
with enough to pay back Sam.

715
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,295
Right, so after Julian's
spine was broken...

716
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:30,757
Tiernan thought Sam must have
been the one who did it...

717
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,966
asked for the gun and
then got revenge himself?

718
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:35,887
Too bad somebody else crippled Julian.

719
00:37:38,014 --> 00:37:39,221
What do you mean?

720
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,892
Tiernan found out Lucifer did it.

721
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,218
That's why he sent me to kill him.

722
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,975
We thought that Tiernan
was upset because

723
00:37:45,978 --> 00:37:47,521
of Lucifer's behavior in the office.

724
00:37:47,523 --> 00:37:48,882
Where did he get the idea that

725
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:50,695
Lucifer was the one to break his back?

726
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,118
No idea.

727
00:37:59,952 --> 00:38:03,037
All right. You said
family heirlooms, right?

728
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,124
Would that also include a family ring?

729
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:08,784
All right.

730
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,713
Have you heard from Pony Boy?

731
00:38:12,715 --> 00:38:14,170
Not yet.

732
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,717
It's time to get to the jet.

733
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,222
Leave town for a while.

734
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,190
What the hell was that?

735
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:33,651
Hello again, Tiernan.

736
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:35,363
I told you this wasn't over.

737
00:38:38,077 --> 00:38:39,659
Finally.

738
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:44,622
It's time for you to receive
the punishment that you deserve.

739
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,465
What about that ring?

740
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:57,784
No, the ring that Tiernan had
on had a family crest on it.

741
00:38:57,787 --> 00:38:59,666
Do you guys really think he would wear

742
00:38:59,669 --> 00:39:01,595
it after taking it off a dead body?

743
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:02,805
It was a family ring,

744
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,808
so I t think Tiernan saw it as
something that was taken from him.

745
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,646
So if we can prove that Sam had the

746
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:09,687
ring on his finger before he was killed

747
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:12,362
and that it's now on Tiernan's
hand, we can arrest him.

748
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:15,067
Before anyone else gets to him.

749
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:16,320
I think I've found it.

750
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,780
Yes, that's it.

751
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:22,160
- Taken before the night he was killed.
- Let's go get him.

752
00:39:35,631 --> 00:39:36,964
Flanders.

753
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,736
I believe you're looking for this man.

754
00:39:44,973 --> 00:39:48,433
I happened to be walking
past Tiernan's office,

755
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:50,895
and I overheard him
talking about leaving town.

756
00:39:50,897 --> 00:39:54,846
As a concerned citizen, I felt it
was my civic duty to bring him in...

757
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:58,029
so he can properly face
the punishment he deserves.

758
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:01,824
Why did you do it?

759
00:40:03,242 --> 00:40:07,079
Something made me realize I might
have gone a bit too far recently.

760
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,708
Hopefully it's not too late.

761
00:40:13,753 --> 00:40:14,921
You looked.

762
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:18,633
You looked, didn't you?

763
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:23,763
At your wings.

764
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:27,363
I did.

765
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:30,476
You did the right thing, Lucifer.

766
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:31,979
It's never too late for that.

767
00:40:56,212 --> 00:40:57,599
Maze?

768
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:02,841
Maze?

769
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:04,146
What are you doing?

770
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:09,809
Giving you your space.

771
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:13,936
I know your heart's in the right place

772
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,264
and it makes me happy knowing

773
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,672
my son's Auntie Maze is in his corner...

774
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:21,010
but I have to ask.

775
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,363
Are you in love with me?

776
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:27,076
What?

777
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,327
I mean...

778
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:34,292
you do have that good things come
in small packages vibe about you.

779
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:36,792
But, no, we're just friends.

780
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:40,087
That's what I thought!

781
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:46,512
You know, Maze, I think you're
looking for something more...

782
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:50,681
than what this baby or I can be.

783
00:41:50,683 --> 00:41:54,228
I think you're looking
for your own connection.

784
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:57,064
For a partner.

785
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:21,420
Hey.

786
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:23,088
Oh, hey.

787
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,007
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

788
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,051
Oh, no, it's fine.

789
00:42:27,053 --> 00:42:29,011
Working pretty late tonight.

790
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,181
Oh, yeah, I was just...

791
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:33,309
wrapping up.

792
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:37,396
Hey, Ella, do you...

793
00:42:40,149 --> 00:42:42,485
do you ever feel just completely...

794
00:42:44,118 --> 00:42:45,829
Lost?

795
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:47,156
Yeah.

796
00:42:51,827 --> 00:42:53,162
You want to talk about it?

797
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:55,782
No.

798
00:42:57,249 --> 00:43:00,086
No, honestly, not really.

799
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:05,424
- You want to talk about it?
- No.

800
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:11,639
But I just don't know...

801
00:43:13,432 --> 00:43:14,892
what to do, you know.

802
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:20,771
Well, I don't recommend a downward
spiral into drugs and alcohol.

803
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:25,025
Tried that, did not help.

804
00:44:02,648 --> 00:44:03,902
Detective Decker.

805
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:09,196
Thank you for coming.

806
00:44:12,575 --> 00:44:17,369
I only came to tell you to stop
putting in requests to speak to me.

807
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:19,519
We have nothing to talk about.

808
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:22,995
I'm sorry... I don't have much time.

809
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,254
They're going to transfer
me back to Rome...

810
00:44:27,256 --> 00:44:28,672
to be tried there.

811
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:30,548
Oh.

812
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:32,511
I can't say I'm sad to see you go.

813
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,221
There's something you need to know.

814
00:44:35,224 --> 00:44:38,431
No, there is something you need to know.

815
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:40,975
You were wrong about Lucifer.

816
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,689
He is a good man.

817
00:44:45,585 --> 00:44:48,004
One might say that he's even an angel.

818
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,364
Lucifer?

819
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:58,454
I came over as soon as I got your text.

820
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:03,790
It's late.

821
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,338
Is everything okay?

822
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,239
You have to help me, doctor.

823
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:16,942
I don't want to be a monster.

824
00:45:18,224 --> 00:45:19,640
What's wrong?

825
00:45:19,642 --> 00:45:20,893
It's my wings.

826
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:27,897
I hadn't checked them since
my devil face returned.

827
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,734
I was afraid they might have gone.

828
00:45:30,736 --> 00:45:32,528
I was afraid what that might mean.

829
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,247
What that might say about me.

830
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:37,076
But earlier this evening I looked.

831
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,512
And?

832
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:41,830
They're still there.

833
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,627
That's good. Isn't it?

834
00:45:49,004 --> 00:45:50,587
I need to warn you

835
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:52,347
about the prophecy.

836
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,800
Prophecy?

837
00:45:53,803 --> 00:45:57,993
You see, I thought that the
prophecy was about you, Chloe.

838
00:45:57,996 --> 00:46:00,305
But I realize now that
I could have been wrong.

839
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:05,271
If it's not you, then who else
could be Lucifer's first love?

840
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:16,910
I saw them.

841
00:46:18,951 --> 00:46:20,242
It was bad.

842
00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:23,652
It was really bad.

843
00:46:27,876 --> 00:46:29,712
You know who it is, don't you?

844
00:46:36,552 --> 00:46:37,803
Is she here?

845
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,175
I thought I could fix it so...

846
00:46:42,975 --> 00:46:45,675
So I didn't hurt him. I stopped myself.

847
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:49,812
- So I don't understand why. Why?
- Why what?

848
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:53,569
I just need you to hear the prophecy.

849
00:46:56,871 --> 00:46:58,115
All right.

850
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:03,535
When the devil walks the earth
and finds his first love...

851
00:47:03,537 --> 00:47:06,370
Why are they still like this?!

852
00:47:06,373 --> 00:47:08,167
...evil shall be released.
