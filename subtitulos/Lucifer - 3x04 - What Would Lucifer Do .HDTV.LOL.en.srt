1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:03,007
Previously, on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,923
Doctor, someone is
forcing those wings on me.

3
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:07,367
They took away my devil face.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,650
I won't stand for someone
making me something I'm not.

5
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:10,539
But your wings,

6
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:11,968
- they grew back?
- They did.

7
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,154
Look, if you're upset about
what the lieutenant said,

8
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:16,558
you're not alone... He's
not a fan of mine, either.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,078
And I still can't believe he
called me "Lucifer's partner."

10
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,751
And even though he doesn't realize it,

11
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:24,109
everything he does seems
designed to hurt me.

12
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:25,203
To test you?

13
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:26,997
My test is Lucifer.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,960
It's always been Lucifer.

15
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,896
I'm Lucifer bloody Morningstar.

16
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:33,281
I do favors better than anyone else.

17
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,883
Or at least I used to.

18
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:36,418
And I think that maybe

19
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,585
it's about time I got back in the game.

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,723
So, tell me, what's your
deepest, darkest fantasy?

21
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:53,194
To have sex in the ball
pit at a Chuck E. Cheese.

22
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:56,397
- Not what I was expecting.
- I mean,

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,535
the thought of getting
caught, it just turns me on.

24
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:02,070
All right, well, I'd rather
eat a plate of warm mayonnaise

25
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:04,839
than visit that child-laden
cesspool, but, um...

26
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:06,841
you are a persuasive one,

27
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:08,776
- aren't you?
- Yay.

28
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:10,820
Ooh, let's practice.

29
00:01:10,823 --> 00:01:11,746
Why not?

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,683
Lexy, darling?

31
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:16,985
- I'm home.
- Oh, no.

32
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:18,184
No, no, no, no, no.

33
00:01:18,187 --> 00:01:20,255
He's not supposed to
be back until tomorrow.

34
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:23,402
Quick. Hide.

35
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:24,671
Lexy.

36
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:26,606
Relax.

37
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:29,030
I'll handle this.

38
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:36,237
What the hell?

39
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,606
Rest easy. I'm not a thief.

40
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:41,012
Your valuables are
untouched... unless, of course,

41
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:42,447
you consider your wife a valuable.

42
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,821
In that case, I've
touched her several times.

43
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:46,525
Twice this morning.

44
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:50,119
Who the hell do you think you are?

45
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:54,120
Lucifer Morningstar, Your Honor.

46
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:57,224
My apologies. I had no idea
I was dealing with a man

47
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:59,893
of such stature. In my defense,

48
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:01,162
when we came in last night,

49
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:03,826
I was blindfolded by your
wife's underwear, so...

50
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:08,127
You're messin' with the wrong guy, pal.

51
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,905
Ah, violence... now we're
getting somewhere interesting.

52
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:12,529
Come on, let it flow. Tell me,

53
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,311
is kicking my ass what you truly desire?

54
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:19,412
No.

55
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,782
No, I just...

56
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:25,153
I... I want a friggin' nap.

57
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,457
Look, I know I'm a cliché.

58
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,291
I married the yoga instructor.

59
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:32,974
But you wouldn't believe
the body on that girl.

60
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:35,311
Wouldn't I?

61
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:36,914
Right.

62
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:38,349
So you get it.

63
00:02:38,352 --> 00:02:39,852
- Mm-hmm.
- In the beginning,

64
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:42,289
it was great... partying
all the time, there was...

65
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,458
Tons of sex.

66
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,960
You must have felt like a new man.

67
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:47,197
But then... let me guess... It became...

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,257
Exhausting.

69
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,425
All of that.

70
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:51,693
Sex, partying,

71
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:54,107
and... Coachella.

72
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,131
- Ooh.
- That's not who I am.

73
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,466
In all honesty, I just...

74
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,365
I just want to chill with my ex, Marsha.

75
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:02,171
She engaged my mind.

76
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:04,706
Well, truth be told,
I've been experiencing

77
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,143
an identity conundrum myself.

78
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,753
Well, that was until I
realized that the best way

79
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,628
to remind myself of the Devil I am today

80
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:15,517
is to fully embrace
the Devil I used to be.

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,959
Are you saying I should call my ex?

82
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:19,220
Absolutely.

83
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:21,023
And I can help you.

84
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:21,957
How?

85
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,792
By graciously keeping your new bride

86
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:27,162
sexually satisfied while you
reconnect with your old wife.

87
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:29,164
Yeah?

88
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,499
Deal?

89
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,267
Uh, deal.

90
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,002
But don't forget...

91
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:37,106
now I've done you a
favor, you owe me one.

92
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:39,408
Of course.

93
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,343
Wh-Whatever you want.

94
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:42,978
Lovely.

95
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,113
Right.

96
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:45,581
Mm.

97
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,017
I, uh, better get on with
my end of the bargain.

98
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:50,819
Lexy, darling,

99
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:53,022
the Devil's back.

100
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,941
Hey, Lieutenant. You busy?

101
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,569
Depends what you're gonna ask me next.

102
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:10,215
Well, uh, in an effort to strengthen

103
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:13,386
my own professional identity
within the department,

104
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:15,644
I'd like to take on some
added responsibility.

105
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:19,649
I'd like to be put up for
the open union rep position.

106
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,819
Request denied.

107
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,616
Can I ask why?

108
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:28,543
See, one of the few benefits

109
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:30,826
of having the "L" and the
"T" in front of my name

110
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,629
is I don't have to explain myself.

111
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,697
Anything else?

112
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,000
No.

113
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,694
Detective.

114
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,165
New body just dropped.

115
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:43,301
Since you're here,

116
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,071
you might as well take it.

117
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:52,805
Whoa.

118
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:54,449
What was that about?

119
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:57,199
- You could tell just by watching?
- Oh, my God, yeah.

120
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:59,021
He is so into you.

121
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:01,124
- You're joking.
- Uh, no.

122
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:03,725
Scorching fire. Five-alarm.

123
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,436
But all I'm gonna say.

124
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,306
I, uh, heard we caught a body.

125
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:08,909
I'll grab my kit.

126
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,686
Lucifer. Where have you been?

127
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,991
Saving a marriage.

128
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:24,795
Listen, I've been waiting
here to tell you that

129
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:27,344
I finally figured out
what my task is from Father

130
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:29,280
- to get my powers back.
- Ah? Well,

131
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:30,784
this should be the
opposite of interesting.

132
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:32,119
It's you, Brother.

133
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,321
You...

134
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:34,756
are my task.

135
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:36,491
Slightly more interesting.

136
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:38,860
How am I your task?

137
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:40,896
I have no idea.

138
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:43,835
I mean, am I supposed
to help you, teach you?

139
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:46,472
You see, I was sent down here
to be with you for a reason.

140
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:49,503
Now, maybe... maybe that means
I'm supposed to learn from you.

141
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:53,609
Well, if you really need
to understand me, Brother,

142
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:55,592
then you must first...

143
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:58,630
walk a mile in my Italian loafers.

144
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,499
Walk a mile in your shoes?

145
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:01,883
Mm-hmm.

146
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:03,685
All right.

147
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,687
Well, tell me how to...

148
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,723
- "Lucifer."
- Oh, baby steps.

149
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:09,958
It took eons to perfect this.

150
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,462
All right, first off, a... a makeover.

151
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:15,430
Clothes.

152
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:17,132
Shoes.

153
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,468
Here's an idea: try smiling.

154
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,889
Right.

155
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:22,100
We can work on that.

156
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:24,339
Through there, my closet, I grant you...

157
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,707
entrée to all things me.

158
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,175
And give me your phone.

159
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:28,911
Okay.

160
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,246
Right.

161
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:34,116
Now you have access to all
my social media accounts:

162
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:36,118
Instagram, Snapchat, Grindr.

163
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,985
Go.

164
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:38,287
Release your inner Devil.

165
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:39,835
But what should I do first?

166
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:41,568
Oh, I don't know.

167
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:43,492
Get laid. Play the piano.

168
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:45,127
Punish evil.

169
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:47,763
Just, whenever you're
faced with a choice,

170
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:50,952
ask yourself the question: WWLD?

171
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,438
What Would Lucifer Do?

172
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:19,142
Hey. Got an ID?

173
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:22,497
Yep. Meet Emily Goddard.

174
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:24,366
23.

175
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:25,600
Counselor here.

176
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:27,269
Body was found in the trough.

177
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:30,238
"Firehawk Ranch.
Transformational Center."

178
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,506
Yeah, it's a high-end reform program

179
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:34,309
for juvenile drug offenders and addicts.

180
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:35,310
Oh.

181
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:36,337
Really?

182
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,646
So, what, she drown?

183
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:38,680
No.

184
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:40,015
Stabbed.

185
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,834
In her office, upstairs.

186
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,940
Then took a tumble
out the window, and...

187
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:45,342
splashdown.

188
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,689
We have a murder weapon?

189
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:50,158
Nothing yet.

190
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,295
But... from the depth of the wound,

191
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:56,031
blunting on one side...

192
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,533
I'd say we're looking for either a knife

193
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:00,068
or a tool with a...

194
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,237
four-to five-inch serrated blade.

195
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:05,107
So this, uh, so-called "reform program,"

196
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,575
it claims to transform
bad kids into good ones?

197
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:10,172
Only reform program I ever knew was

198
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:11,613
my abuelita's boot.

199
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:12,714
It was pretty effective.

200
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:13,949
I'm sure.

201
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,817
Oh, there's the guy in charge.

202
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:17,119
Hi.

203
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,221
Detective Chloe Decker. And he is...

204
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:20,288
Very skeptical.

205
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,859
Jerry Blackcrow...
Founder of Firehawk Ranch.

206
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:26,128
- This is terrible.
- Do you know anyone

207
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,863
who may have wanted to hurt Ms. Goddard?

208
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:30,432
No. She was one of my best counselors.

209
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:33,635
Everyone adored her.

210
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:36,304
Any idea what happened, then?

211
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:38,607
Someone must have snuck onto
the property and done this.

212
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:42,216
Well, we're surrounded
by ne'er-do-wells,

213
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,346
and he thinks the culprit
came from the outside.

214
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:45,447
Delusional.

215
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:47,215
Killer's obviously here.

216
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:48,183
Probably him.

217
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:50,852
Shifty eyes. Or... no, sorry... her.

218
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:52,328
The ginger... She's got

219
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,537
that "I like to watch the
life drain out of people" look.

220
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,892
- Okay.
- Like I'm the only one who sees it!

221
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:58,894
No way one of my kids did this.

222
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:00,929
They all walk the Firehawk Path.

223
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,631
This is a place of transformation.

224
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,800
Uh, no. This is a scam.

225
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:06,301
People can't be changed.

226
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,636
Trust me, I know.

227
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:10,071
Perhaps they just need the
right kind of motivation.

228
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:12,195
As a former addict and ex-con,

229
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,098
I'm living proof that people can change.

230
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:17,212
Our kids graduate to better lives.

231
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:19,347
Sorry to get all interrupty,
but they just found

232
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,211
this tool belt in the victim's office.

233
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:22,708
Looks like an item's missing.

234
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:24,453
Pruning saw's gone.

235
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:27,255
Let me guess... four to
five inches, serrated blade?

236
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:29,591
It's our missing murder
weapon. Whose tool belt is that?

237
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:31,726
One of the residents.

238
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,662
Only they receive them.

239
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:36,317
Oh, well, game, set, match moi.

240
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,866
It appears one of your pupils

241
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,403
has just graduated to murder one.

242
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:47,179
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

243
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:54,677
- "Nine five four four."
- We keep strict records

244
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,708
of all the equipment issued to the kids.

245
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,976
Taking care of your gear

246
00:09:57,978 --> 00:09:59,110
is the sixth stepping stone

247
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:00,545
on the Firehawk Path to healing.

248
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:02,875
Ah, is stepping stone
seven, "Use said gear

249
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:04,781
to kill someone you hate"?

250
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:06,050
Uh, excuse me.

251
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,285
What is that? The badge.

252
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:11,380
Uh, those are Colin's Firehawk wings.

253
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:12,531
Highest honor here.

254
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:14,826
Wings as an honor?

255
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:15,813
Is this a joke?

256
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,982
No. It's part of the reward system.

257
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,699
The better the residents behave,
the more benefits they earn.

258
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,735
Wings are only given to
those who have truly reformed.

259
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:26,104
They get the most sought-after
privileges, like...

260
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:28,840
- computer time, phone calls...
- So, h-hold on.

261
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:31,872
You curtail the free will
of these rebellious souls

262
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,211
by making them follow your rules,

263
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:34,368
and then you trick them into thinking

264
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,412
they've changed by giving them wings?

265
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:39,985
A most vile manipulation.

266
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:41,887
And completely unoriginal, I might add.

267
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,421
- Lucifer...
- Tyson Chase.

268
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:46,158
The tool belt... it was
assigned to Tyson Chase.

269
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:50,629
Where can we find Tyson?

270
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,117
Well, it appears Tyson used
his wings to fly the coop.

271
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,912
Still think people can change?

272
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,313
Tell me, what is it you desire?

273
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:45,850
For you to move so I
can talk to my boyfriend.

274
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:48,271
Oh. S-S...

275
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,930
Sorry about that.

276
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:03,235
Hello, there.

277
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:07,205
- Guess what?
- What?

278
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,174
You get to have sex with me.

279
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,612
Didn't go as planned.

280
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,245
Hi.

281
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:28,994
You want to buy me a drink?

282
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:35,870
Tyson's father

283
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:38,370
in jail, mother's dead. Foster care.

284
00:12:38,372 --> 00:12:40,138
In and out of juvie since he was seven.

285
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,773
Record is sealed.

286
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:43,675
Judging by the size of his file,

287
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:46,344
Firehawk Ranch was probably
Tyson Chase's last stop

288
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:48,866
before a long stay at
Chino or San Quentin.

289
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,782
Hmm. You get something from MTA?

290
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:53,118
Yup. Camera caught him
exiting a station in Hollywood.

291
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,786
No sign of him after that.

292
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,824
Hey, Decker, how's it going
with the Firehawk case?

293
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,272
Very well, sir.

294
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:03,275
Uh, murder weapon still missing.

295
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:05,144
Although, we've identified the suspect.

296
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:07,198
Tyson Chase. He's a resident.

297
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,234
There's a BOLO out.

298
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:10,502
So no one's in custody yet?

299
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:11,824
Not yet.

300
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,873
Thought you'd be further along.

301
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,347
Wow.

302
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:24,616
Why is Pierce such a dick to me?

303
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:26,484
Who cares? He's a dick to everybody.

304
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:27,694
No, but I seem to be getting

305
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:29,954
extra helpings of his dickishness.

306
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:31,589
I know he's considered a rock star

307
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:33,992
downtown with the suits, but
if he's got a problem with me,

308
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:36,417
I want to find out, I want to fix it,

309
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,730
and I don't want it
messing with my career.

310
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:40,881
Maybe you're not the problem.

311
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:43,701
Lucifer!

312
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:45,089
Mm.

313
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:50,576
Well, looks like someone could
use a single malt cappuccino.

314
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:52,877
Single malt latte?

315
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,936
I'd prefer

316
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:55,646
if you helped us find Tyson Chase.

317
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,949
Your focus has been all
over the map on this case.

318
00:13:57,952 --> 00:14:00,852
Well, I forget how much you've
come to rely on me these days.

319
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:03,321
Allow me to consult.
Catching this little

320
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:04,811
degenerate is quite simple.

321
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:07,591
Whatever Tyson's sin was in
the past, he's back at it.

322
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:08,760
And you know why?

323
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:10,595
People don't change.

324
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:13,074
We don't know his crimes.
His record is sealed.

325
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:14,136
Tyson's a minor.

326
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,117
Well, I'll call a
judge, get it unsealed.

327
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,519
It may take a few days.

328
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:20,205
Or not. I may have a
way to cut a few corners.

329
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:22,542
Getting caught cutting
corners is the last thing

330
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:23,980
I need right now, Lucifer.

331
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:26,811
It'll be better if I handle it alone.

332
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:29,949
Go fish.

333
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:34,052
Ah. Hello, Judgey.

334
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:35,815
And this must be Marsha.

335
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:36,921
Uh, Lucifer.

336
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:38,990
- What do you want?
- That favor returned.

337
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:40,492
I need your help proving

338
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:42,660
a young deplorable hasn't
reformed and never will.

339
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:45,096
So... your turn to pick

340
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:47,499
from the pile, I think.

341
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,432
Bravo.

342
00:14:57,435 --> 00:14:59,310
Quick. I mean, not Vin Diesel quick,

343
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,325
but impressive nonetheless. Scoot over.

344
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,455
Well. Tyson Chase.

345
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,487
Your record said you liked to steal cars

346
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:10,505
to pay for your drugs.

347
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,156
Vintage muscle cars, to be precise.

348
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,725
And you've been arrested here twice.

349
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:16,960
I guess third time's a charm,
and by charm, I mean me.

350
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:19,330
Yeah, but my record's
sealed. How'd you know?

351
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,665
I called in a favor.

352
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,455
'Cause I need to prove to that
charlatan at Firehawk Ranch

353
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,277
that you are and always
will be a criminal.

354
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,901
Whatever, man.

355
00:15:27,904 --> 00:15:30,608
Look, if you a cop,
I got nothing to say.

356
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,644
Nothing matters anymore anyway.

357
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:34,579
I'd rather die than go back.

358
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:36,690
Well, that can be arranged.

359
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:38,683
Oh!

360
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:40,585
Whoa! Oh, oh, oh.

361
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:42,372
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man! Okay, okay.

362
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,355
Chill out. Chill out.
Chill out! Slow down.

363
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,357
- Slow down.
- I'm not gonna slow down, Tyson.

364
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,155
You said you wanted to die.
Do you want a quick death,

365
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:51,862
- or a slow death?
- No! I take it back. Stop. Stop.

366
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:55,800
Hey, man, what... what you doing?

367
00:15:57,838 --> 00:16:00,753
Okay, look, I take it back,
all right? I take it back.

368
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:03,347
I don't want to die. I'll come
with you, tell you anything.

369
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,049
Smells like you might need a change

370
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:06,776
of underpants first, Tyson.

371
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:16,055
I present to you one unreformable gnat

372
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,425
- to answer for his crimes.
- Where did you find him?

373
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:20,828
I witnessed the little
reprobate stealing a getaway car,

374
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,696
so I carried out a citizen's arrest.

375
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:25,833
Like I said, once bad, always bad.

376
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:27,593
Look, get this psycho dude away from me!

377
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:28,771
He almost killed me!

378
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:30,504
Hello, kettle.

379
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:31,972
Pot calling.

380
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:36,710
However, I must commend you on
your choice of murder weapon.

381
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:38,812
- Murder weapon?
- We found your tool belt

382
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:39,991
in Emily Goddard's office,

383
00:16:39,994 --> 00:16:42,316
minus the pruning saw
that you used to kill her.

384
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:44,318
Wait. Emily's dead?

385
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,121
Oh, my God.

386
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:50,391
- You think I killed her?
- Yes.

387
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:53,394
No. Look, I loved Emily.

388
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:54,858
I'd never hurt her.

389
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:56,397
People heard you fighting, Tyson.

390
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,132
Because she wouldn't talk to me.

391
00:16:58,134 --> 00:16:59,800
I just wanted to talk.

392
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:01,139
About what?

393
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,006
Look, I turned 18,

394
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:08,242
and didn't have to stay
at the ranch anymore.

395
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:10,244
I wanted her to come with me.

396
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:14,081
Look, we kissed one time...

397
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,617
but she said it was... she...

398
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,753
she said it a mistake.

399
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:22,623
She wouldn't leave.

400
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,158
Oh, no.

401
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,526
She rejected you?

402
00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:27,238
So you killed her!

403
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:28,762
This is all my fault.

404
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,698
Oh, finally, we're getting somewhere.

405
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:35,897
No. Look, if-if I hadn't left,
Emily would still be alive.

406
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,440
- I could've protected her.
- From who?

407
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:41,508
Uh, she was worried about

408
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,952
expelling a resident.

409
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:44,378
Said everything had gone to hell.

410
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,413
That's why she wouldn't talk with me.

411
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:49,583
That's why we fought.

412
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:53,253
Look, please, you have to believe me.

413
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:54,931
- Filthy liar.
- I believe him.

414
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:56,667
My gut tells me it's not him.

415
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,192
And I want to explore this mystery

416
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:00,056
resident that Emily wanted to expel.

417
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,428
How much walking and talking

418
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,923
like a murderous,
sociopathic duck is necessary

419
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:06,734
for us to realize the killer
is sitting in our laps?

420
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:11,171
Something you'd like
to add here, Espinoza?

421
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,008
Uh, no. Sorry. I just...

422
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,043
I need to go help a
friend who's in trouble.

423
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:18,178
Well, don't let your day job keep you.

424
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,939
I'll have the victim's files sent over.

425
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,755
Maybe we can get a lead on
whoever she wanted to expel.

426
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,255
I doubt I could be less impressed

427
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,823
by the lack of consensus here.

428
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:33,627
All we have now is no murder
weapon and a possible motive?

429
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:35,462
We got to cut him loose.

430
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:36,764
Without a murder weapon,

431
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,565
we don't have enough
evidence to keep him.

432
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,902
Hello, Tyson. Just me again.

433
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:45,916
Now, why can't you embrace
your true self, hmm?

434
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,166
You're a bad seed.

435
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,144
Just celebrate the darkness inside.

436
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:51,964
- No, please! Just leave me alone!
- I won't leave you alone until

437
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,323
- you tell me the truth.
- Look, please don't hurt me.

438
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:54,848
I promise I've changed.

439
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,850
Lucifer, let him go!

440
00:18:56,852 --> 00:19:00,654
I take full responsibility
for his actions.

441
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:03,390
- This won't happen again.
- Why not?

442
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,259
Kid turns out not to be the murderer,

443
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:06,872
your friend just scared him straight.

444
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,229
Well done, Lucifer.

445
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,331
Way to be a good influence.

446
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,439
How dare you say that?

447
00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:15,936
Do you see what you've done now?

448
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:24,011
I'll show them a good influence.

449
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:35,519
Good morning. Good morning.

450
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:37,658
Right, gather 'round,
children. Gather 'round.

451
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,992
Come on.

452
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:40,438
Don't be shy.

453
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:41,941
Don't be shy. I don't bite.

454
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:44,364
Ah.

455
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,706
- Who's the suit?
- Lucifer Morningstar,

456
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:50,370
your substitute counselor
and resident bad influence.

457
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:52,005
Is this some kind of reverse psychology?

458
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,211
I assure you,

459
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:56,314
my budding miscreant,
nothing of the sort.

460
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:58,784
No, the lesson I'm about to teach you

461
00:19:58,787 --> 00:20:01,363
is pure deviance. Yes, come on.

462
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,386
Room for everyone. Come
on, you at the back. Right.

463
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:09,723
Okay, before I start, I'd
humbly like to ask you guys

464
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:12,993
a little about yourselves, so, tell me,

465
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,995
what is it you all desire?

466
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:16,753
- Get rich.
- Instagram model.

467
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:17,998
- Make people feel good.
- Oh.

468
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,266
- I just want to be alone, man.
- Be my own boss.

469
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:20,480
Play video games!

470
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:21,535
My father's love.

471
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:22,736
- Oh.
- Easy money!

472
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:24,071
I just want to get high, man.

473
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:26,831
I hear you. I hear you. Right.

474
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,300
So what I'm getting

475
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:31,071
is that you all want to get
back to your true selves.

476
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:35,769
I mean, yes, micro-nutrients

477
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,551
in the soil are important,

478
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:38,786
but the key here, people,

479
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:42,167
the key here is vertical integration.

480
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,238
And it all starts with
solid distribution.

481
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:48,425
Right. Now, I'm partial
to the Paraguay corridor,

482
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:49,463
mainly because...

483
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:50,464
Oh, oh, uh?

484
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,432
Pl... Yes. Hair boy.

485
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,868
Uh, but what about hands-on experience?

486
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,855
Oh, right.

487
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:59,392
Well, I do happen to
know some wonderful CEOs

488
00:20:59,394 --> 00:21:01,238
down in Sinaloa, Mexico.

489
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:03,463
Perhaps I could arrange
some internships.

490
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:05,198
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, well.

491
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,436
The way to hell really is paved
with bad acne-prone intentions.

492
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:10,602
So much potential here! But...

493
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:12,972
Sorry. Am I boring you, darling?

494
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:16,222
Yeah. Screw Paraguay
and micro-nutrients.

495
00:21:16,225 --> 00:21:18,945
The only things you
need to be your own CEO

496
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,547
is irrigation and a south-facing slope.

497
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,694
Ah.

498
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:29,156
Here's your drug empire, Teach.

499
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:37,486
Well, then.

500
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:40,474
It appears someone's
gunning for extra credit.

501
00:22:15,238 --> 00:22:17,880
Don't get high on your own supply.

502
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:20,399
Don't get high on your own supply.

503
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:22,581
Snitches end up in ditches.

504
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:25,094
Snitches end up in ditches.

505
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:26,797
Hugs, not drugs.

506
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,789
No... Sorry, sorry. Reverse that one.

507
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,658
Drugs, not hugs.

508
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,293
Drugs, not hugs.

509
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:34,661
Lucifer?

510
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:36,279
Detective.

511
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:38,698
What is going on here?

512
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,880
And how did you get that horse?

513
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:42,335
What horse?

514
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:43,670
Ugh.

515
00:22:43,672 --> 00:22:45,739
Bye!

516
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,074
Ah, they should award him his wings.

517
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,943
Then he'd look like Pegasus.

518
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:52,697
What are you so upset about?

519
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
I mean, it was a
valuable teaching moment

520
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:55,834
for the children.

521
00:22:55,837 --> 00:22:57,951
They are our future, after all.

522
00:22:57,953 --> 00:22:59,735
You're teaching them to grow drugs.

523
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:02,105
No, no, no, I'm teaching
them to sell drugs.

524
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:04,256
Regardless, what brings you here?

525
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,159
Our job.

526
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:09,963
Which is to find the kid
that Emily was about to expel.

527
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:11,498
In her files, it said

528
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,397
that she had recently
busted one of the residents

529
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:15,902
for apparently running a drug operation.

530
00:23:15,904 --> 00:23:17,570
No.

531
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:18,838
Oh.

532
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,240
Right. So... Well, it appears

533
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:21,808
I've been doing our job, too.

534
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,177
Carly, front and center.

535
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,912
My prized pupil.

536
00:23:25,914 --> 00:23:28,243
She had her own weed operation
already up and running.

537
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:30,950
Oh. So, this is all yours?

538
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,653
Not saying a word without my lawyer.

539
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:35,855
Sorry, I taught her that.

540
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:37,257
But I have to say, Detective,

541
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:39,859
this young lady really is going places.

542
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:42,830
Mm-hmm. Yeah. All the way to jail.

543
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,160
Yo, buddy.

544
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:49,802
What the hell happened, man?

545
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,805
Detective Espinoza.

546
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,473
It's good to see you.

547
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,716
When I heard the charges, I mean...

548
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:58,323
Listen, we had just
performed the act of love,

549
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:00,560
and then she demanded money.

550
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:03,149
At first, I assumed it was for bus fare,

551
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,084
but then she wanted
quite a large amount.

552
00:24:05,086 --> 00:24:07,153
And then her cousin showed up,

553
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,689
who shared very little familial
resemblance, by the way,

554
00:24:09,691 --> 00:24:11,291
and then he also demanded money.

555
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:13,880
Right, right. So when
he wouldn't take no

556
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:16,427
for an answer, you got into
a fight, and you beat him up.

557
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,764
Uh-huh.

558
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:19,399
You do realize she's a call girl, right?

559
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:21,522
I know what a prostitute is!

560
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:27,120
I just didn't know she was one.

561
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:29,894
And then, her cousin... well,
he wouldn't listen to reason.

562
00:24:29,897 --> 00:24:33,179
You mean... her pimp?

563
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,582
Yes, of course.

564
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,051
Look, I don't need any
of the details, all right?

565
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:39,886
The important thing is,
the watch commander's

566
00:24:39,888 --> 00:24:42,675
my old training officer,
so I pulled some strings.

567
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:45,988
You're cut loose. Don't worry.

568
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:48,262
Don't worry. I didn't
say a word to Lucifer.

569
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,266
How we doing on the investigation?

570
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:53,433
Well, this investigation has...

571
00:24:53,435 --> 00:24:55,168
smoked out

572
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,644
Carly Glantz. Rap sheet a mile long.

573
00:24:57,647 --> 00:24:59,808
Made no progress at reform.

574
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:01,608
Working theory is that she found out

575
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,456
Emily was about to expel her.

576
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:05,892
So she killed her to protect
herself and her drug operation.

577
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:08,128
And then, Carly lawyered up
before we could get to her.

578
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,898
- Still no murder weapon?
- And no evidence tying her to the scene.

579
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:12,034
Lucifer, any thoughts?

580
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:13,686
Lucifer is not

581
00:25:13,688 --> 00:25:14,988
in the state of mind

582
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,217
to offer any constructive
advice right now.

583
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,519
Reach for the unexpected

584
00:25:18,522 --> 00:25:21,088
and allow yourself to be surprised.

585
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:22,691
Like crisps and chocolate.

586
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:26,601
The results can be quite pleasing. Mm.

587
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:29,005
That's good advice. Decker,
throw out the manual.

588
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:30,139
Think outside the box.

589
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:31,456
- Yes, Lieutenant.
- What?

590
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,175
I'm sorry. What are you asking me to do?

591
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:35,042
Because Carly isn't gonna talk.

592
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,607
I want to talk.

593
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:44,553
Ah. Allow yourself to
be surprised indeed.

594
00:25:44,555 --> 00:25:47,096
So, you want to make a statement?

595
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:50,026
Yeah. So...

596
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:53,129
I guess I've been enlightened
by the Firehawk Path.

597
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:55,164
And I know I can't find my happiness

598
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,899
if I don't present my truth.

599
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:59,292
The night of the
murder, I saw Tyson Chase

600
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:01,604
digging by the sundial,
burying something.

601
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:03,372
- Burying what?
- Don't know.

602
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:06,042
It was dark, and I was
looking through a window.

603
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:08,940
Geez, do I have to do
all your work for you?

604
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,591
Carly, tone.

605
00:26:10,594 --> 00:26:12,915
Should I roll over and fetch, too, Dad?

606
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:15,117
Parents. Am I right?

607
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,653
So, how do I know you didn't kill Emily?

608
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:18,888
Because Carly has

609
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,990
an iron-clad alibi.

610
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:23,542
During the murder, she
was in the shared room...

611
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:25,861
on the computer,

612
00:26:25,863 --> 00:26:27,931
video chatting with her boyfriend.

613
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:34,136
Now, instead of harassing
my daughter any further,

614
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:37,074
I suggest you go see
what's under that sundial.

615
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,066
I don't mean to backseat

616
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,370
dig, but aren't you a
bit far from the sundial?

617
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:48,135
I've got it. Thanks.

618
00:26:48,138 --> 00:26:49,963
At least, I hope I do.

619
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:55,385
Hey, Ella, you're kind of, sort
of friendly with the lieutenant.

620
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:56,921
What's his deal?

621
00:26:56,923 --> 00:26:58,523
Regarding what?

622
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:01,912
Well, no matter what I
do, it seems Pierce wants

623
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:03,827
to be a complete jerk to me.

624
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,065
Oh, this isn't about that
crazy vibe between you two?

625
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,893
No, this is about professional
respect, which I've earned.

626
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,337
I have the best close
rate in the department,

627
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:15,302
and it seems like, no
matter where I turn,

628
00:27:15,305 --> 00:27:17,439
Pierce is there,
questioning my judgment.

629
00:27:17,442 --> 00:27:19,242
Are you talking about
the new lieutenant?

630
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:21,011
I like him. Very good judgment.

631
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,810
Totally agree. Spot on.

632
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,284
What? It's true.

633
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:28,005
Okay, you got it all wrong.

634
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:28,851
Look,

635
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:31,929
at first, I didn't think Pierce
liked me, either, but then,

636
00:27:31,932 --> 00:27:33,899
a couple of days ago in the kitchen,

637
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,851
he hands me the creamer

638
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,078
and the sugar.

639
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:41,383
And I didn't even ask for it.

640
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:43,234
I know, right?

641
00:27:43,236 --> 00:27:44,500
Right.

642
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:48,305
See, Pierce had noticed
how I liked my coffee.

643
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:52,710
Just pay attention to his
actions, not his words.

644
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:58,031
And regardless, Decker,
you are a total badass.

645
00:27:58,034 --> 00:27:59,433
Thank you, Ella.

646
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,658
You got something?

647
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,374
"Nine five four four."

648
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:18,644
It's Tyson Chase's number.

649
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:20,313
I guess he is our killer.

650
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:23,840
See? What did I tell
you? Once a bad guy,

651
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:25,445
always a bad guy.

652
00:28:34,574 --> 00:28:38,476
The blood on Tyson Chase's
pruning saw matches the victim.

653
00:28:38,478 --> 00:28:40,683
Carly Glantz puts the bloody saw

654
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,514
in his hands after the murder.

655
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:46,586
So Tyson Chase equals homicidal maniac.

656
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:48,353
- What am I missing?
- Nothing.

657
00:28:49,498 --> 00:28:52,357
Oh, sorry. It's just exhausting
being right all the time,

658
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,894
isn't it? I'm kidding.

659
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:54,925
It's amazing.

660
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:57,027
Wait a minute. What if
Lucifer really is right?

661
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,113
Oh, go on.

662
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:00,742
Then if, per Lucifer,
people really don't reform,

663
00:29:00,745 --> 00:29:02,532
that would also apply to Carly Glantz.

664
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:04,194
Once bad, always bad, right?

665
00:29:04,197 --> 00:29:06,004
Right. Finally you get it.

666
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:08,326
So, then, how the hell did
the worst kid in the program,

667
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,873
on the verge of expulsion,

668
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:12,277
earn highly-coveted computer privileges

669
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,873
to video chat with her boyfriend?

670
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:16,210
I don't know. Sexual favors?

671
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,373
Well, I want to go back
and talk to Jerry Blackcrow,

672
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:20,751
ask him some more questions.
Something doesn't add up.

673
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:22,120
You think Blackcrow's involved?

674
00:29:22,122 --> 00:29:23,522
I don't know. Maybe.

675
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:25,764
I want to know why Carly
is getting these privileges.

676
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:26,936
Lucifer, you coming?

677
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:29,560
Oh, I can't. Sorry. Duty calls.

678
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:31,062
Oh. What's duty's name?

679
00:29:31,064 --> 00:29:34,299
Lexy, if you must know, a
judge's soon to be ex-wife.

680
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:35,533
It's a long story.

681
00:29:35,535 --> 00:29:37,045
Great. Are you really not coming?

682
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:38,836
I made a promise, Detective.

683
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:41,539
And who am I if I'm not a
devil of my word? Besides,

684
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,474
we both know this
case is already solved.

685
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:44,676
Lucifer, go.

686
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:46,711
You've earned some private time.

687
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:49,280
Ah, well, thank you, Lieutenant. See?

688
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:50,982
Great judgment.

689
00:29:50,984 --> 00:29:53,518
I don't care what you say.
I'm gonna keep digging on this.

690
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,219
I think it's time I ride along with you.

691
00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:58,690
Frankly, Lieutenant, just
because you and I disagree

692
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:00,591
does not mean I need a baby-sitter.

693
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:01,908
You coming, Decker?

694
00:30:18,144 --> 00:30:21,813
My father is trying to teach
me a lesson about Lucifer.

695
00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:24,753
Problem is, I don't know what it is.

696
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,050
And he didn't tell you?

697
00:30:26,052 --> 00:30:28,219
He's a bit, uh...

698
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:30,588
- enigmatic, my dad.
- Ah.

699
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,315
Sounds complicated.

700
00:30:32,318 --> 00:30:34,792
You have no idea.

701
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:39,335
So I've been, um, walking
a mile in Lucifer's shoes

702
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,700
to learn more about him,
to try and understand him.

703
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:45,101
Bro, what's there to understand?
The guy does what he wants,

704
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:46,938
he says what he wants,
he gets away with it.

705
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,242
He parties constantly, he apparently

706
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:53,311
has an endless supply of cash,
drives a sick-ass ride. Thanks.

707
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:57,851
And he gets to have sex with a
different hot girl every night.

708
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:01,971
What a terrible, lonely existence.

709
00:31:01,974 --> 00:31:04,743
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sounds awful.

710
00:31:06,326 --> 00:31:08,328
Anyway, Dan, thanks for bailing me out.

711
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:09,727
No problem, man.

712
00:31:09,729 --> 00:31:12,253
We all need someone to have
our backs every now and then.

713
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:15,870
You're right. We do.

714
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:24,876
You sure this is the right way?

715
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:26,081
Positive.

716
00:31:30,483 --> 00:31:32,483
I'm a badass, you know.

717
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:33,956
Excuse me?

718
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,292
Even though you don't trust me.

719
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:37,028
What makes you think I don't trust you?

720
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:38,213
Oh, let's see.

721
00:31:38,216 --> 00:31:41,088
You've only been breathing
down my neck this entire case.

722
00:31:41,091 --> 00:31:44,495
Any time Lucifer sneezes,
you praise him, you berate me.

723
00:31:44,497 --> 00:31:46,798
You chose to ride along just
so you could check up on me.

724
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,267
Oh, and you shot down my
request to be union rep

725
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,701
without even considering it.

726
00:31:50,703 --> 00:31:52,634
What? You think this is all a joke?

727
00:31:52,637 --> 00:31:54,772
I'm laughing because you
think me turning you down

728
00:31:54,774 --> 00:31:56,474
for that union rep job was a bad thing.

729
00:31:56,476 --> 00:31:58,042
How is it a good thing?

730
00:31:58,045 --> 00:32:00,032
That job is for has-beens.

731
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:02,213
I'm not gonna waste one
of my best detectives

732
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:03,981
while you attend useless meetings.

733
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:06,323
And the only reason I came
here was so I could finally

734
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:07,994
see you in action firsthand.

735
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:10,470
You think that I'm one
of your best detectives?

736
00:32:10,473 --> 00:32:12,023
Decker, gun!

737
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:51,855
Lieutenant, come on.

738
00:32:51,858 --> 00:32:53,997
Stay with me.

739
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,767
Unit 831. Officer down!

740
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,067
Officer down!

741
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:11,227
Get their statement and
get back to me, please.

742
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:12,829
- Detective?
- Thank you.

743
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,631
Are you okay?

744
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,299
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

745
00:33:16,301 --> 00:33:18,168
I mean, thanks to Lieutenant Pierce.

746
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,302
He saved my life.

747
00:33:19,304 --> 00:33:20,904
Jerry Blackcrow tried to kill you.

748
00:33:20,906 --> 00:33:22,038
I don't believe it.

749
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,507
Wait. What am I saying?

750
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,848
Didn't he say he was an ex-con himself?

751
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:29,065
More proof there's no such
thing as transformation.

752
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:30,501
Hey, can we talk about this later?

753
00:33:30,504 --> 00:33:33,650
- I got to get to the hospital.
- I...

754
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:37,854
Have 'em notify Union Station, too.

755
00:33:37,856 --> 00:33:39,856
Daniel?

756
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:41,001
Yeah.

757
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:42,659
Have you located the reform guru?

758
00:33:42,661 --> 00:33:44,561
- I'd like to have a word.
- Yeah? Well, get in line, pal.

759
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:45,962
We put out a statewide APB,

760
00:33:45,964 --> 00:33:47,684
we're checking bus stations, airports.

761
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:49,499
So far, nothing.

762
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:52,860
Look, man, Chloe's fine.

763
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:54,170
Luckily, Pierce was with her.

764
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,260
But I wasn't.

765
00:34:00,263 --> 00:34:03,857
Hey, guys, I want you to
check all local ATM cameras.

766
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,174
If Blackcrow is fleeing,
he's gonna need cash.

767
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,218
That's the only way to
get any at this hour.

768
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,161
Unless he's got a stash somewhere.

769
00:34:34,713 --> 00:34:39,149
So, this is where the
Firehawk Path leads.

770
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:41,519
A soggy stash of coke-dusted twenties

771
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:43,255
and a boat ride to Mexico.

772
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:44,924
How did you find me?

773
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:47,857
My prized pupil mentioned
using her dad's beach condo

774
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:49,220
as a stash house.

775
00:34:49,223 --> 00:34:51,791
Of course her partner would know that.

776
00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:55,498
What do you want, Mr. Morningstar?

777
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,868
To see the look on your
face when you finally admit

778
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,775
it was all a scam,

779
00:35:00,778 --> 00:35:04,474
a ploy to bilk desperate
parents into falsely believing

780
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:07,101
that you could fix their
malevolent offspring.

781
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:09,149
I did a lot of good for those kids.

782
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:11,586
So I was right about
people not changing,

783
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:13,116
just wrong about who.

784
00:35:13,118 --> 00:35:15,618
I warned Emily,

785
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,154
but she wouldn't listen to reason.

786
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:20,023
It was her own fault.

787
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:21,424
What about the detective?

788
00:35:21,426 --> 00:35:23,874
She was just in my way, man.

789
00:35:23,877 --> 00:35:25,738
I'm not going back to jail!

790
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:36,940
Your punishment will
be far worse than jail.

791
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,060
Lucifer, stop!

792
00:35:57,062 --> 00:35:58,094
You're gonna kill him.

793
00:35:58,096 --> 00:36:00,296
So what?

794
00:36:00,298 --> 00:36:02,665
Once evil, always evil, right?!

795
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:05,132
No, Luci. You're not evil.

796
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:07,003
You're the Devil.

797
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:08,471
You punish evil.

798
00:36:10,596 --> 00:36:12,376
Your words.

799
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:36,577
You gonna say hello, Decker,

800
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,969
or just creep around the room?

801
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:41,916
Sorry, Lieutenant. I didn't know

802
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:43,697
if you were sleeping
or not. I wanted to say

803
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,924
thank you for what you did.

804
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:48,728
It's just part of the
job. It's no big deal.

805
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:51,775
No, it's a huge deal. You saved my life.

806
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:53,307
I'm so grateful.

807
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,743
And you saved mine.

808
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,313
We're even.

809
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,759
So have you ever been
injured on the job before?

810
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,663
I've had a few scrapes.

811
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:10,432
The possibility of
death has never felt...

812
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:12,433
so real before.

813
00:37:12,436 --> 00:37:14,069
Yeah.

814
00:37:14,072 --> 00:37:18,776
You know, when I was shot,
I was completely freaked out.

815
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:23,213
I kept thinking, like, how
could it all end so suddenly?

816
00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:27,424
But the best thing I did
was, I went back to work, and

817
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:29,494
I just kept at it, you know?

818
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,898
'Cause you really do
realize life is so short.

819
00:37:32,909 --> 00:37:36,145
And you have to just
live it while you can.

820
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,283
Speaking of work, I-I should get back

821
00:37:42,286 --> 00:37:45,120
and, uh, finish up
Blackcrow's arrest sheet.

822
00:37:45,123 --> 00:37:48,221
Um, I-I don't know if you
heard, but he turned up

823
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,088
half-beaten, hogtied in Malibu.

824
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:52,724
Karma, I guess.

825
00:37:52,727 --> 00:37:55,080
Anyhow,

826
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,517
thanks again for the...

827
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,158
whole lifesaving thing.

828
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:03,275
Couldn't let anything
happen to my best detective.

829
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:09,151
So now I'm your best detective?

830
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:13,076
I didn't want you to
get all full of yourself.

831
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:18,525
I can see why Lucifer's
so affected by you.

832
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:22,075
It's because you're special, Decker.

833
00:38:29,462 --> 00:38:31,428
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hi.

834
00:38:31,431 --> 00:38:33,463
Uh, Lieutenant, I just wanted to say

835
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:36,538
that, um, I hope you feel better soon.

836
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:37,983
Thanks, Espinoza.

837
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,861
I also wanted to thank
you for putting me up

838
00:38:39,864 --> 00:38:42,086
for the union rep
position. Sorry, Chloe.

839
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:44,838
I know you wanted that one, too.

840
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:46,296
And I...

841
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:47,704
I won't let you down, sir.

842
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:48,907
I know you won't.

843
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,476
You earned it, buddy.

844
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,739
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

845
00:39:05,787 --> 00:39:09,355
So, my guardian angel, I think
this calls for a celebration.

846
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,025
I was lucky you turned up when you did.

847
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:14,429
How did you find me, by the way?

848
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:17,515
Location service on
one of your dating apps.

849
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:22,888
Maybe luck had nothing to do
with when I showed up, Luci.

850
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,656
Maybe Father wanted me there.

851
00:39:24,658 --> 00:39:28,226
You give him way too
much credit, Brother.

852
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,210
What's so funny?

853
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:34,079
Well, nothing.

854
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:36,868
It's just, it took you
walking a mile in my shoes

855
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,370
to prove my point to me.

856
00:39:38,372 --> 00:39:40,172
Okay. And what point is that?

857
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:41,707
That I haven't changed.

858
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:43,057
Wings,

859
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,275
no wings, unable to show my true face...

860
00:39:45,278 --> 00:39:46,377
it doesn't matter.

861
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,613
I'm exactly who I always was.

862
00:39:48,615 --> 00:39:50,682
A punisher.

863
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:53,051
And for reminding me
of that, I salute you.

864
00:39:53,053 --> 00:39:55,053
Oh, that's very kind of you.

865
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:57,989
But, you see, I don't
think it was the human

866
00:39:57,991 --> 00:39:59,524
that you were trying to punish today.

867
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:01,416
Well, who else would
I be trying to punish?

868
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:02,820
Yourself, Luci.

869
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:07,072
For not being there for
Chloe when she was in danger

870
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:09,309
because you care about her deeply.

871
00:40:11,148 --> 00:40:13,337
And if that truly is the case,

872
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,943
then you really have changed
from the old Lord of Hell.

873
00:40:17,945 --> 00:40:20,378
But this is good, Luci.

874
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,415
This is so good.

875
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:26,765
Because I've finally figured
out how you are my test.

876
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:30,188
You see, Father wants me to just...

877
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,682
just be there for you.

878
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:34,358
To have your back.

879
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:36,260
Now that you're evolving.

880
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:50,076
There was this, uh, soul that
I used to torture back in Hell.

881
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:55,210
And like a good masochist,
he'd call the shots.

882
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:57,729
"Burn me." "Freeze me."

883
00:40:57,732 --> 00:40:59,165
"Hurt me."

884
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,134
So, I did.

885
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:03,721
And this went on for centuries

886
00:41:03,724 --> 00:41:06,494
until one day, for some reason,

887
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:10,465
he missed his daily punishment.

888
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,468
And when I returned...

889
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,596
he was crying.

890
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:19,814
"Please, my king," he said.

891
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:22,979
"Don't ever forget me again.

892
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,117
I promise I'll be good."

893
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:32,484
It was then that I realized he
was so full of self-loathing,

894
00:41:32,486 --> 00:41:35,821
void of any self-respect, that

895
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:39,124
no matter the depth of my cruelty,

896
00:41:39,126 --> 00:41:43,461
whatever miniscule attention I paid...

897
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:46,064
gave meaning to his...

898
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:48,166
pointless existence.

899
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:52,322
Why are you telling me this?

900
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:59,338
Because he reminds me of you.

901
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,916
And you think I've changed?

902
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:09,187
You... the former angel,

903
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:11,556
powerless and pathetic,

904
00:42:11,558 --> 00:42:14,626
a disgraced failure with no better way

905
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:18,463
to spend your days than
yipping at my heels for scraps

906
00:42:18,465 --> 00:42:22,221
to remind you of a time
of when you once mattered.

907
00:42:29,742 --> 00:42:31,642
Hmm.

908
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:33,579
I know what you're doing.

909
00:42:37,385 --> 00:42:40,439
And you can kill the
messenger if you must.

910
00:42:42,155 --> 00:42:44,385
But just know that I am here for you.

911
