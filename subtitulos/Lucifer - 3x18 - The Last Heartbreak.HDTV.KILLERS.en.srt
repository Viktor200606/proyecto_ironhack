1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,429
- Previosly on Lucifer...
- Mama's gone?

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:03,882
Yes. I mean, she says

3
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:06,018
good-bye forever. She
loves you very much.

4
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:07,287
I'm missing time.

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,723
It's like someone else

6
00:00:08,726 --> 00:00:10,159
was living my life.

7
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:11,928
The one man I've cared about...

8
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:13,497
I still gave him up.

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,419
That's how much I care
about our friendship.

10
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:16,875
Go... to...

11
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:17,977
Hell.

12
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,079
In the surveillance van,

13
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:20,491
when I asked you to stay in L.A.,

14
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:21,882
we did have a moment there.

15
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,567
Which is why I had to
tell you that I'm not

16
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,775
relationship material.

17
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:26,765
You're terrified of letting
someone get close to you

18
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:28,258
'cause you know they'll
eventually leave you.

19
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,135
- You'll outlive them.
- You got to have faith,

20
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:31,648
because life can surprise you.

21
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,906
Now, if my brother, the
Devil, can have that...

22
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,041
Maybe I can, too.

23
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:49,440
So, what brings you here?

24
00:00:49,443 --> 00:00:51,424
Work.

25
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:55,060
What you working on?

26
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:56,595
A case.

27
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,131
Well, you want to take a
break and buy me a drink?

28
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:00,666
Not really, no.

29
00:01:11,464 --> 00:01:13,231
Got to admit.

30
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:15,808
Watching these women trying
to get your attention...

31
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,077
Best part of my night.

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,435
I don't know what I'm gonna do

33
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:19,995
when you finally say yes to one of them.

34
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,586
Never gonna say yes.

35
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:23,957
Oh, yeah? 'Cause somebody
already stole your heart?

36
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,434
It's just not in the cards for me.

37
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:31,071
We got to go, Detective.

38
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,849
Um... duty calls.

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,173
All right.

40
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:52,851
Two more bodies were just found
in Griffith Park holding hands.

41
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:54,920
Looks like the Broken
Hearts Killer strikes again.

42
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:56,421
Stop calling him that.

43
00:01:56,423 --> 00:01:57,889
Why? What's the problem?

44
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:58,779
Because you never know

45
00:01:58,782 --> 00:02:00,849
when something stupid
like that's gonna stick.

46
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:02,860
Come on. That'll never stick.

47
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,604
Wow. Last night was so...

48
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:14,388
- That was quite the concert.
- Yes!

49
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:15,621
I can't remember the last time

50
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:17,408
I went to a show that was so, uh...

51
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:20,502
- Loud.
- So loud! I still can't hear anything.

52
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:22,647
They totally boned.

53
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:25,350
Miss Lopez, please don't be vulgar.

54
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,111
The detective doesn't... bone.

55
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:31,028
Seriously, do you not
see the epic fireworks?

56
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,097
There's more chemistry
over there than in my lab.

57
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,401
And they just went to the Axara concert.

58
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:37,260
It's a natural aphrodisiac.

59
00:02:37,263 --> 00:02:39,297
Well, if you're a pimply
millennial, perhaps,

60
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:40,950
but the detective is a grown woman

61
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,366
with sophisticated tastes.

62
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:45,137
Trust me, she's not so easily won over.

63
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,639
Oh, my God.

64
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:49,841
You are totally freaking out right now.

65
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:51,076
What?

66
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:53,545
About this coming between you and Chloe.

67
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:55,177
Don't be preposterous.

68
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,649
I'm not freaking out about anything.

69
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:00,285
It's okay. Okay, I-I get it.

70
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:02,521
You're afraid that

71
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:05,026
they're gonna start spending
all their time together.

72
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:07,459
You know, joining each
other at crime scenes,

73
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:08,960
bantering over dead bodies.

74
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:10,829
And where does that leave you, right?

75
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:13,598
I assure you, Miss Lopez, that
is the least of my worries.

76
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,001
The chemistry in there is just a...

77
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:17,235
a flash in the pan.

78
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:18,437
- Exactly.
- Mm.

79
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,588
A completely hot flash in the pan.

80
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:27,179
Lucifer, what you and Chloe
have is on a total other level.

81
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:29,748
Exactly. Nothing is changing.

82
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,690
Nope. Nope.

83
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:33,901
Anyhow, I just...

84
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:35,554
I wanted to say thank you for coming.

85
00:03:35,556 --> 00:03:37,541
I just... I had a really great time.

86
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:39,491
So when can we do it again?

87
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:41,669
Um... uh...

88
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:42,971
a con... a concert, or...?

89
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:45,163
I was thinking something quieter.

90
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,265
Maybe dinner?

91
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,494
I know a pretty good Italian
place if you're into that.

92
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:53,721
Uh, I mean, I love... Italian,

93
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:55,107
but, uh,

94
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,608
weren't you saying that
you didn't want to...?

95
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,317
Hey, Chloe, I just wanted to, uh...

96
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,815
I'm sorry.

97
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:01,213
I didn't mean to interrupt.

98
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:02,914
- My bad.
- No, no. You're good.

99
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,082
We were just, um...

100
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:05,485
Just...

101
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:09,229
What's up?

102
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:11,256
Well, uh, we have a
case... Double murder.

103
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:12,657
Some couple found in a convertible

104
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,092
at a lookout off Griffith Park.

105
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:16,068
Super creepy scene, by the sounds of it.

106
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:17,963
Mm-hmm. Okay, I'll be right there.

107
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:20,499
Espinoza, could I get
a copy of that file?

108
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,834
Sure thing.

109
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:35,147
What would I like?

110
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,015
Well...

111
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:41,348
sometimes the answer to
that is not so simple, is it?

112
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,885
I mean, I would like to know
what my father's next test is.

113
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:47,092
I feel pretty confident
that I passed the last one,

114
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:50,629
but... what's next?

115
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:52,963
And what am I supposed to do in between?

116
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:55,432
Or is that, in itself, a test?

117
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:57,235
Okay.

118
00:04:57,237 --> 00:05:00,338
How about a large mocha with extra whip?

119
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,221
Sure. Sure.

120
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:03,675
- Okay.
- Okay.

121
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,575
Large Americano for Charlotte.

122
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,776
Mom? Mom?!

123
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:18,113
I can't believe it's you.

124
00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:20,416
Uh, Lucifer said that you were gone,

125
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,360
that-that he used the Flaming Sword

126
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:24,830
and sent you into another universe.

127
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:28,346
What are you doing back here?

128
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:30,770
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

129
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:33,838
Uh...

130
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
no.

131
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:37,108
No, you don't.

132
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,643
I, um... I'm sorry.

133
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:40,111
I thought you were someone else.

134
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:43,086
No, wait. You know Lucifer,

135
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,190
so you do know me.

136
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:48,408
What did you mean, a "Flaming Sword"?

137
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:51,263
I'm really sorry, but I have to go.

138
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,424
For the record, Detective,
I'd like you to note

139
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,986
that I haven't once asked you
about your evening with Pierce.

140
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:03,690
I realize it's none of my business.

141
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:04,703
You're right. It's not.

142
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,561
But Miss Lopez thinks you boned.

143
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:07,697
What?

144
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,673
Her words, not mine.

145
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:11,113
I, uh, simply thought you should know.

146
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:13,010
We just went to a concert, you know?

147
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:13,833
It's not a big deal.

148
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,447
Right. That's what Dr. Linda said, too.

149
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,447
Well, for having this
not be your business,

150
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,264
you're certainly talking
to a lot of people about it.

151
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:21,299
I know. I just wish
people would stop prying.

152
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:23,171
But regardless, I've
come to the conclusion

153
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:25,330
that no matter what
happens with you and Pierce,

154
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,775
you and I are partners, Detective,

155
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:28,343
and nothing can come between that.

156
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:29,916
Prepare yourselves, people.

157
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,455
This is a different kind of case.

158
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:44,794
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

159
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,657
Lieutenant, what brings you here?

160
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,499
I had a gut feeling about this case.

161
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,251
I wanted to see if I was right.

162
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:54,928
As much as we appreciate your
digestive feelings, Lieutenant,

163
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:57,105
the detective and I have
this utterly under control,

164
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:59,420
- so, if you don't mind...
- I don't mind at all.

165
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:03,345
Ella, what do we have?

166
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:06,888
Meet Robbie Matthews and Rachel White.

167
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,517
Looks like they were
drugged unconscious,

168
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,019
and then someone literally
smashed their chests in.

169
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:12,352
Do we know how they were drugged?

170
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:15,055
Uh, best guess, maybe the killer
used some form of anesthetic.

171
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:16,235
Liquid or aerosol.

172
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:18,774
And then crushed their
ribs, their sternum.

173
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:20,694
And finally, their hearts.

174
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:22,898
Well, it's not hard to figure
out what the desire was here.

175
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,766
Well, the killer was clearly
trying to send a message.

176
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:26,968
That he couldn't stand
this couple's relationship.

177
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,134
So, what?

178
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,971
We think maybe she
had a jealous stalker?

179
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,174
Or an angry ex. We
need to talk to anyone

180
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:33,742
who had a problem
with this relationship.

181
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,183
See, we've got this, Lieutenant.

182
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,576
No need to mess with success.

183
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:38,213
Which one of them was married?

184
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:41,950
Well, no weddings rings, so,
neither of them, obviously.

185
00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:43,931
But good on you for participating.

186
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:45,987
Has anyone checked
their chest cavities yet?

187
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:47,756
What? Why would we do that?

188
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,125
In the 50s, there was a
guy named Clark Hoffman.

189
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:51,827
He was known for making his victims

190
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:53,360
swallow their wedding rings.

191
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:54,842
Right, the Broken Hearts Killer.

192
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:55,767
By the time they caught him,

193
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,431
he'd killed seven
cheating couples in L.A.

194
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,595
His crime scenes were
about as gruesome as this.

195
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:01,642
Wow, you really know a lot about this.

196
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:03,178
The cop who solved the case

197
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,920
was an old mentor of mine.

198
00:08:04,923 --> 00:08:07,912
And didn't Hoffman die
a few days ago in prison?

199
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:09,711
Making him a particularly
useless addition

200
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:10,759
to this conversation.

201
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,781
Unless his death inspired a copycat.

202
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,350
Or maybe they're using this
as an MO to throw us off.

203
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:16,751
Thank you.

204
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:19,321
- I hope that's all it is.
- All righty,

205
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:21,189
guess we'll get out
the old chest spreader

206
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,991
and go fishing for some wedding rings.

207
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:26,528
Or, according to their
social media profile,

208
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,897
Rachel was single,
and Robbie was married.

209
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,665
We need to talk to the spouse ASAP.

210
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,036
Yep. Don't worry.

211
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,339
Nothing's changing.

212
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:39,674
- Nothing at all.
- Hmm.

213
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:42,944
Okay, Monkey, you grab the backpack,

214
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:44,522
I'll grab the... brownies,

215
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,693
and we'll get you to school.

216
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:50,252
Maze, are you home?

217
00:08:50,254 --> 00:08:51,620
Hey...

218
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:52,954
Daddy...

219
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:55,435
- there's a man in my bed.
- What?

220
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,759
And he smells bad.

221
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,396
I see you found the band.

222
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,002
Go wait in the car.

223
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,603
Seriously, what were you thinking

224
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:11,263
letting a drunken rocker
sleep in Trixie's bed?

225
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,575
I was thinking he was too drunk

226
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:15,744
to make it up the stairs to Chloe's bed.

227
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:16,912
What's the big deal?

228
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:18,280
The big deal, Maze,

229
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:20,154
is that you live with a nine-year-old.

230
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:21,783
It's not okay.

231
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:25,071
Ooh... did I make Dan mad?

232
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,289
Why are you...

233
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,229
Are you going through something lately?

234
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:31,276
Other than the band, no.

235
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,994
Fine.

236
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:35,143
Whatever. Clean up.

237
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:37,232
I don't want to have to
tell Chloe about this.

238
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:38,935
She has enough on her plate right now.

239
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:40,570
You know, there are some things

240
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:42,540
I could tell Chloe, too.

241
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:44,572
Like what?

242
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:45,907
Like...

243
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:48,710
remember when we had a guy killed?

244
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,779
Yeah.

245
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:52,514
That was fun.

246
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:56,284
Seems we both have things
we'd rather Chloe not know.

247
00:09:56,286 --> 00:10:01,222
Look, I don't know what's
going on with you right now,

248
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:04,553
but whatever it is... figure it out.

249
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,633
Emma Mathews just got brought in.

250
00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:13,456
And Emma Matthews is...

251
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:14,573
The victim's wife.

252
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:16,050
Right. Yes, of course.

253
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:18,373
Well, mustn't keep the
murderous lady waiting.

254
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:19,675
Mind if I join?

255
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:21,743
You sure? You don't have to.

256
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:23,111
I know. I want to.

257
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:25,981
Great. The more the merrier.

258
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:28,847
Uh... I know what you're doing.

259
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,318
I'm getting ready to question a suspect.

260
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,865
And I hate to break it to you, Cain,

261
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:33,269
but there's only room for one immortal

262
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,226
in the detective's life,

263
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:36,502
- and that position's already been filled.
- By you.

264
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,706
The detective and I are a team...
A package deal, if you will.

265
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:42,190
Sadly, there's just no room for a third.

266
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:43,837
And I don't understand why

267
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,484
you're trying to spend
time with her anyway.

268
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:47,077
What happened to the
whole wanting to die thing?

269
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,245
I had a change of heart.

270
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,682
I'm sorry if I upset you.

271
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:51,119
I didn't think you two were a thing.

272
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:52,253
We're not a thing.

273
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:53,508
We're partners.

274
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,404
Well, if that's all it
is, then you've got nothing

275
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,472
to worry about, do you?

276
00:10:56,475 --> 00:10:58,413
Wait...

277
00:10:58,415 --> 00:10:59,848
Right.

278
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,384
Yeah.

279
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,458
Fine, fine.

280
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:09,491
I prefer standing anyway.

281
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:10,692
Emma,

282
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:12,694
four months ago, your
husband reported that

283
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:15,755
you slashed his tires.
Then two months ago,

284
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,692
neighbors saw you throwing
rocks through his window.

285
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:20,150
And then just last month,

286
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:22,319
you were seen threatening
him with a bat.

287
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:23,656
Can you explain that?

288
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:29,110
Look, I'm not proud of what happened.

289
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:31,052
But I was upset.

290
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:33,756
I just found out Robbie
was cheating on me.

291
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,325
Well, completely understandable.

292
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,618
I mean, what else are you supposed to do

293
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,754
when some parasite inserts
himself into your relationship?

294
00:11:39,756 --> 00:11:42,223
So is that why you did this?

295
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:44,259
What?

296
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:45,828
Is this for real?

297
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:51,623
I... admit I hated Rachel,

298
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:53,559
but I would never hurt Robbie.

299
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:55,403
I-I may have gone a little nuts

300
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:57,817
when I learned he was cheating, but...

301
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,200
after the courts forced me into therapy,

302
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:01,609
we started talking.

303
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,262
We chose to divorce amicably.

304
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,214
Oh, God.

305
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:07,598
I can't believe he's dead.

306
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,901
This is preposterous.

307
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:10,637
Do you really expect us to believe

308
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,657
that you were okay with
someone tearing you two apart?

309
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,325
- It's the truth.
- Does the name

310
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:17,895
Clark Hoffman mean anything to you?

311
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:19,360
Who?

312
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,329
I know we're gonna check out her alibi,

313
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:23,348
but my gut tells me to believe her.

314
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,384
Oh, please. Just 'cause
she spouted some drivel

315
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:26,797
about conscious uncoupling?

316
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,989
Because she has no idea who
the Broken Hearts Killer is

317
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,757
and she has no motive
to go after Robbie.

318
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,092
Well, she's obviously lying,

319
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:33,927
about her relationships and the murders.

320
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:35,562
Please tell me I'm not
the only one who sees that.

321
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:36,997
- Detective?
- I think we can't take

322
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,273
- Emma's word at face value.
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:40,867
We don't have to. Another couple

324
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:42,302
was just found dead holding hands.

325
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,645
This time at a cheap motel.

326
00:12:43,648 --> 00:12:45,072
The Safari Inn.

327
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:48,008
This isn't just a lovers' quarrel.

328
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,476
No, you're right.

329
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,978
The copycat's just getting started.

330
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,613
Lieutenant, we need you on this case.

331
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:57,586
And I normally love threesomes.

332
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:09,203
Meet Mary Lee and Dennis Horn.

333
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,244
Just like our first lovers,
they were drugged unconscious

334
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:14,548
before the killer took something
really big and really hard

335
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,485
and literally...

336
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:17,153
- Bludgeoned their hearts.
- Mm-hmm.

337
00:13:17,155 --> 00:13:19,761
And then moved them here
and staged this whole scene.

338
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:22,365
And just like the other
victims, one of them's married.

339
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,194
She's got a tan line on her ring finger.

340
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:25,595
We actually ended up finding

341
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,289
a wedding ring inside the first victim,

342
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:30,033
so good bet we'll probably
find one here, too.

343
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:31,167
Any other evidence?

344
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,948
More like lack thereof.

345
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:34,384
Place was wiped clean,

346
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,739
just like the first crime scene.

347
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:37,440
I mean, this killer, you guys,

348
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,366
whoever he... Or she... is,

349
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:41,501
total pro.

350
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,070
Well, Emma's alibi checks out.

351
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,241
There's no obvious connection
between the couples.

352
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:47,711
I just wonder how the
killer's picking his targets.

353
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:49,119
Well, Lieutenant,

354
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,227
as our resident Broken Hearts expert,

355
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,664
wouldn't you say it's time to
enlighten us with your wisdom?

356
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,773
No one knew how the original
killer chose his victims.

357
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:58,962
I guess we just got lucky
we caught him when we did.

358
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,096
"We"?

359
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:02,012
The LAPD.

360
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,982
We don't have time for
luck. We got to get back

361
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,485
to the station, figure out a connection

362
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:06,603
between these victims.

363
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:07,971
Yes, I couldn't agree more, Detective.

364
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,739
After all, the sooner
we finish this case,

365
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:12,843
the sooner things can
all go back to normal.

366
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:15,912
Oof.

367
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:17,932
Gnarly.

368
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:31,094
You're burning my table.

369
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:32,195
Hmm?

370
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,393
Oh, I'm sorry.

371
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:35,762
Um...

372
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:38,640
You don't ever take a
moment to stop, do you?

373
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:40,403
No rest for the wicked,

374
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:42,573
so no rest for me, either.

375
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,211
I've got you figured out, you know.

376
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:49,719
You do, huh?

377
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,214
You could work anywhere...

378
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:52,818
Your office, your home,

379
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:54,773
but you choose to work in this bar.

380
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:55,919
Why?

381
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:57,420
I like a stiff drink?

382
00:14:57,422 --> 00:15:00,256
Because you don't
actually want to be alone.

383
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:02,025
Then why do I sit by myself?

384
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,294
Maybe you feel like you
don't deserve the company.

385
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,878
Well, look who's a detective now.

386
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,266
So, what are you spending all these

387
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:12,769
lonesome hours on, anyway?

388
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:14,373
I'm working on trying to find the guy

389
00:15:14,376 --> 00:15:15,742
who kills cheating couples.

390
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,478
The Broken Hearts Killer?

391
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,172
That's what they call him.

392
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:21,813
Six crime scenes, not
one shred of evidence.

393
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:23,883
It's like I'm looking for
clues that don't exist.

394
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:25,789
It never ceases to amaze me,

395
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,120
the lengths people will go to

396
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,172
when they want to make
something just right.

397
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:31,054
What do you mean?

398
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,189
Like when people come into the bar

399
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:34,591
for a special occasion,

400
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:37,151
like a birthday or a proposal.

401
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:39,194
Sometimes they'll come
in here days ahead of time

402
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:40,914
just to make sure everything's perfect.

403
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,472
Maybe it's the same for

404
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,603
whoever this Broken Hearts guy is.

405
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:49,409
All right, Lieutenant, what
did you want to show us?

406
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:52,175
- I may have a lead.
- Ah, did you find it during A.V. Club?

407
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:53,676
We already know the killer disabled

408
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:55,311
the hotel's surveillance cameras.

409
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:56,813
On the day of the murders, yes,

410
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:58,915
but then I started
thinking what if the killer

411
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,414
scoped out the location a week before?

412
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:03,386
And I found this.

413
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:05,914
- Wait, is that...
- Our guy? Maybe.

414
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:09,383
The car's registered to a Neil
Berger, former schoolteacher.

415
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,077
Well, that's it, a chap snapping photos?

416
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,813
How do we know he's not scrapbooking?

417
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:16,365
I put an APB out on him, and...

418
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:17,972
We just got a hit.

419
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:20,104
He's been spotted in front of
the original killer's house.

420
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:21,172
Let's go.

421
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:23,239
We-Well, that's...

422
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:25,543
actually quite promising.

423
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,653
Hi.

424
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,489
Listen, I know we're not
exactly speaking right now,

425
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:41,204
but there's something
that I need to tell you.

426
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:42,592
Okay.

427
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:45,028
Now, don't freak out, but, uh,

428
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:46,898
Charlotte Richards is back.

429
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:47,964
Oh...

430
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,099
But you have absolutely
nothing to worry about, Linda.

431
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:52,669
She's not, uh...

432
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,537
You know, she's not Mom anymore.

433
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:56,940
Wow.

434
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:58,474
It's really kind of you

435
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,336
to come all the way over
here to tell me that.

436
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:04,414
I mean, especially... when
you must be dealing with...

437
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,848
such a shock yourself.

438
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,144
You knew, didn't you?

439
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:10,414
I may have run into Charlotte

440
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,415
a few times... I don't know,

441
00:17:12,418 --> 00:17:15,052
maybe... here.

442
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:16,344
You're treating her, Linda?

443
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:18,228
You didn't think,

444
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,230
just once,

445
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:23,148
that maybe I had the right
to know that she was alive?

446
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:24,919
I assumed you knew.

447
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,207
Well, maybe you can help me.

448
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:34,039
For the last time, man,

449
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,633
please, please quit taking
pictures of my house!

450
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:37,847
Your house?

451
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,616
You're lucky you get to live here, okay?

452
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:41,438
This place should be a
freakin' landmark by now!

453
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,469
Do you know who lived
here? A great artist, man.

454
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:45,355
- Who are you?!
- Seriously, last warning, dude.

455
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:46,828
Next time, I'm calling the cops.

456
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,212
Call the cops. They'll be on my side.

457
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:49,292
Oh, whatever.

458
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:51,949
- Neil Berger?
- Yeah.

459
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:54,820
Wow. Sorry you had to witness that.

460
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,289
Um, bah.

461
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,523
Okay, who's ready?

462
00:17:58,526 --> 00:17:59,883
Ready for what?

463
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:02,272
For the wonder that is
the Broken Hearts Tour.

464
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:04,875
Duh. You guys are my 3:00, right?

465
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:06,401
Uh-huh.

466
00:18:06,404 --> 00:18:08,515
All right, all right. Let's
get some ponchos on you.

467
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:11,634
When I ran into Charlotte,
I-I-I may have mentioned

468
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:13,265
a few things that I shouldn't have.

469
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:16,653
But by the time I realized
that she wasn't Mom...

470
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:17,854
it was too late.

471
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:19,088
Oh, no.

472
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,758
You know, she was just staring at me

473
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:22,825
with these... these lost eyes,

474
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:24,495
searching for answers.

475
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:27,992
What are you asking me, Amenadiel?

476
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:31,367
I think that maybe she
deserves to know the truth.

477
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:32,802
I understand that

478
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:33,936
you miss your mom

479
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,836
and that you didn't
get to say good-bye.

480
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,304
But Charlotte is a
woman who has literally

481
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:40,054
been to Hell and back.

482
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:41,811
She's fragile.

483
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:44,947
When I found out the
truth, it nearly broke me.

484
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:46,583
And I was stable.

485
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:48,719
So what are you saying?

486
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,766
I'm saying if you really
want to help Charlotte...

487
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,425
you'll stay away.

488
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,948
Originally built in 1909,

489
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:00,851
Hoffman's iconic Craftsman home

490
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:03,101
is just blocks away
from what I like to call

491
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:04,934
"The Last Heartbreak"...

492
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,453
The scene of the final murder,

493
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:07,870
and where the killer was ultimately

494
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:10,039
apprehended by police.

495
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,670
Why are we wasting our time

496
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:12,971
with these ridiculous shenanigans?

497
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:14,974
Let's just grab this
miscreant and be done with it.

498
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:16,442
Because, unfortunately, we don't have

499
00:19:16,444 --> 00:19:17,978
enough evidence to arrest him.

500
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:19,912
Serial killers love
talking about themselves.

501
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:21,347
The more Neil talks, the more likely

502
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:22,582
he'll incriminate himself.

503
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,684
I may as well be speaking to myself.

504
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:25,931
Uh, I'm listening.

505
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:28,303
Um, excuse me, uh, Neil, is it?

506
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:30,758
Yeah. Well, I was wondering
what you thought about

507
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:32,428
this new copycat killer who surfaced.

508
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:34,660
Ask me, it was only a matter
of time before someone picked up

509
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:36,763
where the original killer left
off. You know, someone special.

510
00:19:36,765 --> 00:19:38,429
Someone who knew there
was a need for what he did.

511
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:41,501
Right. The original
killer, he was an auteur.

512
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:42,834
But this new guy, he's just...

513
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:44,237
Sort of a cheap copy.

514
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:46,639
Whoa.

515
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:48,141
Hold on a second.

516
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,776
This new guy is not the original,

517
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:51,744
okay, but he is a damn sweet cover.

518
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:53,592
He is efficient, he is precise.

519
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:55,397
I mean, he gets the
little details right,

520
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,316
down to the interlocking fingers.

521
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:59,253
Detective Decker, LAPD.

522
00:20:01,623 --> 00:20:03,389
That information wasn't
public yet, was it?

523
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:04,897
No, it wasn't.

524
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,517
Finally, this bloody charade is over,

525
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,384
and things can all go back to normal.

526
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:14,872
I'll meet you back at the precinct.

527
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:18,071
Ow.

528
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:29,337
You're burning my table.

529
00:20:33,387 --> 00:20:35,954
Can I help you?

530
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:37,257
Kay?

531
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:45,336
Kay. Kay, how is this possible?

532
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:47,104
Is this a prank?

533
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:48,639
Did someone put you up to this?

534
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:49,855
Look, I get it.

535
00:20:49,858 --> 00:20:50,965
I look just like my grandmother,

536
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,576
but this is taking things too far.

537
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,879
Your grandmother, of course.

538
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,415
I'm sorry, I knew her back in the day.

539
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,017
The resemblance is incredible.

540
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:01,785
You knew her back in the day?

541
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:03,461
How old were you, like, two?

542
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:05,164
I'm older than I look.

543
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:09,693
Well, Mr. Older Than
You Look, I'm Maddie.

544
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:11,162
Hi. Pierce.

545
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:13,693
I used to come in here a lot,

546
00:21:13,696 --> 00:21:15,065
back when I was just a detective.

547
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,600
That's what we do here...

548
00:21:16,602 --> 00:21:18,969
Cheap drinks, good cooking and cops.

549
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:21,363
That's actually how my grandparents met.

550
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:22,873
Gramps was a cop,

551
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,608
and he met Nana when
she was waiting tables.

552
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,311
- "Raids" White is your grandfather?
- Yep.

553
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:28,712
Cops are always coming in here

554
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:29,980
and geeking out over him.

555
00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:31,615
Well, yeah. Kay married the cop

556
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,484
who solved the Broken
Hearts Killer case.

557
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:36,141
Well, he made the arrest,
but he never really solved it.

558
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:37,788
He caught the guy red-handed,

559
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,453
staging bodies in the Chavez Ravine.

560
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,992
True, but he never revealed
how he chose his victims.

561
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:44,428
It drove Gramps crazy, so he kept at it

562
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,821
even after he retired.

563
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:48,532
He would sit in that booth right there

564
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:51,535
with his old files when Nana worked.

565
00:21:51,537 --> 00:21:53,812
Where is Ray these days?

566
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:56,350
Forest Lawn Cemetery.

567
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,977
Uh, Gramps passed about six years ago.

568
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:02,079
And her?

569
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:04,816
Followed a little after.

570
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,532
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

571
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,021
They lived a long, happy life together,

572
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:13,557
and went peacefully, a few months apart.

573
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,699
That sounds nice.

574
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:23,734
All right, case closed, I assume.

575
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:26,203
And not a particularly
interesting one, in retrospect.

576
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:28,738
Let's find something that's
more challenging, you know?

577
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:30,621
More "us."

578
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:33,365
This case isn't over. We have
to get a confession out of Neil.

579
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:36,469
Oh, so you and Pierce can do
your dynamic duo thing again?

580
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:38,749
No. It's you and me
this time, no Pierce.

581
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:42,276
Oh. No Pierce, but we're still
following his lead in absentia.

582
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,845
We are following the case.

583
00:22:43,848 --> 00:22:45,416
Let's go solve this.

584
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:49,750
So Neil, from your tour,

585
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:52,086
I saw that you like
to tell a good story,

586
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:55,365
so tell me one now: how'd you do it?

587
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:56,500
Yeah.

588
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:58,836
Uh, well, it was early.

589
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:01,071
And, uh, we met at a bar.

590
00:23:01,073 --> 00:23:03,449
And then, I, uh, I gave him a sign.

591
00:23:03,452 --> 00:23:06,860
And he came over, at which
point, I think I said, "Hey,"

592
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:08,449
and then, he was all like...

593
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:10,280
- "Hey," and then...
- Right. Can you fast-forward

594
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:12,850
to the part where you smashed
the couples' chests in?

595
00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:14,985
Wait a minute.

596
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:17,438
You-you think I'm the copycat?

597
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:19,867
You fit the killer's
psychological profile to a T,

598
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,969
you know things about the case
that no one else could know.

599
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:24,505
Oh, my God.

600
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:26,641
This is gonna be so
amazing for the tour.

601
00:23:26,644 --> 00:23:28,632
Now I'm actually part
of the investigation.

602
00:23:28,634 --> 00:23:30,501
Oh, geez, I owe McMillan now.

603
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:32,013
Mc... McMillan?

604
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:33,949
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Officer
McMillan over in Vice.

605
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:35,352
He's helped me out throughout the years.

606
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:36,391
You know, he would slip me, uh,

607
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:37,574
copies of stuff for the tour.

608
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:39,042
And then, when these new
killings started happening,

609
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,238
well, I bought some photos off of him,

610
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,212
and it was the best 400
bucks I've ever spent.

611
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:45,574
Ha! So Pierce doesn't
know everything, after all.

612
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:50,855
Thank you.

613
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:57,194
Hey, Dan.

614
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:58,729
If you're looking for Twisted Ferret,

615
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:00,468
they've got a gig in Bakersfield.

616
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,400
They'll be back.

617
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:07,704
Because this gig is still
the best gig in town.

618
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:08,976
The school called.

619
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:10,638
Apparently, Trixie gave pot brownies

620
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:12,906
to Ms. Benson for
Teacher Appreciation Day.

621
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,895
Well, did she appreciate them?

622
00:24:14,898 --> 00:24:16,898
No, she didn't, Maze.

623
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:20,096
She didn't appreciate
being rushed to the hospital

624
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:21,979
when she couldn't feel her legs anymore.

625
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,682
The woman's 70 years old. What
the hell were you thinking?

626
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:29,276
Hey, not my fault the old hag
can't handle the good stuff.

627
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,112
It's not a joke, Maze!

628
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:33,003
Our one red line is our daughter,

629
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:34,893
and things like this cannot happen.

630
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:37,763
Or what, Douche?

631
00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:42,570
If you want to live in
the same home as my kid,

632
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:47,376
you can't keep pulling stunts like this.

633
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:48,845
Fine.

634
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:50,381
I'll move out.

635
00:24:50,384 --> 00:24:52,042
Since none of you want me here anyway.

636
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:53,200
That's not what I'm saying.

637
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:54,596
No.

638
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:58,367
No, you would all love me
to be something I'm not.

639
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,362
Well, I am not a babysitter.

640
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:03,093
I am not a roommate.

641
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:06,468
And I am sick of your
Goody Two-shoes ex-wife,

642
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,404
and that stupid little
brat of yours anyway.

643
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:11,292
Maze.

644
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:19,588
Classy.

645
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:23,062
So Neil isn't our killer.

646
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:25,553
No, he's just an obsessed tour guide

647
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:27,956
who legally obtained crime scene photos.

648
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:30,071
- So we don't have any suspects.
- Yeah, and our killer

649
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:31,359
could be trying to find his next victim.

650
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:32,837
We need a lead.

651
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,584
Hold on.

652
00:25:34,587 --> 00:25:37,610
You said your grandfather
kept copies of all his files.

653
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:38,812
Do you still have them?

654
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:40,235
Somewhere in the back, yeah.

655
00:25:40,237 --> 00:25:42,036
My mom didn't have the
heart to throw them out.

656
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:43,371
You mind if I take a look?

657
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:45,073
Sure.

658
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:48,476
Chloe, meet me at The Adams.

659
00:25:48,478 --> 00:25:49,944
I may have something.

660
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:51,417
Yeah. I'm on my way.

661
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,198
Ah. I know that look.

662
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:55,250
Either there are new sandwiches
in the vending machine,

663
00:25:55,252 --> 00:25:56,351
or you have a lead.

664
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:57,721
Actually, Pierce has a lead.

665
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,143
Oh, for goodness' sake.

666
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:00,909
He wants us to meet him. Why?

667
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:02,345
So we can watch him pontificate

668
00:26:02,348 --> 00:26:04,191
while leading us down
another blind alley?

669
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:06,294
What is your problem today?

670
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:09,364
My problem, Detective, is that
we don't need a third party

671
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:11,065
interfering with our partnership.

672
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:12,267
You know what? Maybe it's best

673
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:13,245
if I meet Pierce alone.

674
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:15,769
We don't have time to
make this about you.

675
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:17,939
There is a serial killer on the loose.

676
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:19,875
Uh... Detective.

677
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:27,733
To wrapping up your latest case.

678
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:29,158
Sayonara, Broken Hearts Killer.

679
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,593
Well, Ray was actually
the one to catch him,

680
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:33,063
but I'm happy to drink to that anyway.

681
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,546
Now, maybe you can
take me on a real date,

682
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,775
instead of just pie and drinks here.

683
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:52,615
Let me guess, you already
have your next case.

684
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:54,083
No, not this time.

685
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:57,419
Um...

686
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:59,421
I'm transferring.

687
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:00,556
Out of state.

688
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:02,391
Transferring?

689
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:03,425
Why?

690
00:27:03,427 --> 00:27:06,695
It's just... time.

691
00:27:06,697 --> 00:27:08,235
I don't understand.

692
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:10,699
This is what I do. I move
forward and I never look back.

693
00:27:10,701 --> 00:27:13,802
But I thought we... you and I were...

694
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:14,870
I deal with death every day,

695
00:27:14,872 --> 00:27:16,834
and someday, you're gonna
die, too, and I just...

696
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:18,274
You have these walls up,

697
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:21,670
and I thought it was part
of your whole tough guy act,

698
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:26,373
but now I see what it is: you're scared.

699
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,484
But you know what the sad truth is?

700
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:30,352
If you don't learn to open up,

701
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:33,857
nobody will ever love you.

702
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:37,840
I know.

703
00:27:37,843 --> 00:27:39,444
Pierce, look at this.

704
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:43,165
Hey.

705
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,500
Pierce.

706
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:45,701
Are you okay?

707
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:47,204
Yeah, sorry. Um...

708
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,740
What were you saying?

709
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:50,072
Your mentor,

710
00:27:50,074 --> 00:27:52,441
look at all this stuff
that he found, like,

711
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:54,009
look... these call logs.

712
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:56,685
They prove that the
original killer's victims

713
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:59,612
all had spouses that called
into the Dear Dottie radio show.

714
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:02,849
That was a radio show about
love and relationship advice.

715
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:03,919
Yeah.

716
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:05,545
Yeah. You really know your history.

717
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:07,415
A-Anyway,

718
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:10,168
it's the only connection that
was found between the victims.

719
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:11,671
But that show went
off the air years ago.

720
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:13,435
I'm not sure how it's gonna help us now.

721
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:15,938
Well, if the original killer
listened to the radio show

722
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:17,417
to find his victims, then maybe

723
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,154
the copycat's doing the same thing.

724
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,604
So the question is what
radio show would that be now?

725
00:28:21,606 --> 00:28:23,302
Oh, my God. Chance's Chocolates?

726
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:25,123
I'm obsessed.

727
00:28:25,126 --> 00:28:27,910
It's a radio show that
sets up cheating couples.

728
00:28:27,912 --> 00:28:30,013
See, Chance brings someone on who thinks

729
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:31,747
their spouse is cheating, and then,

730
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:35,365
he calls the cheater
pretending to be a candy shop

731
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:37,146
giving away free
chocolates as a promotion,

732
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,054
and asks who they should send it to.

733
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:41,023
- How thrilling.
- Right?

734
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:43,058
And then, the person
either names their partner

735
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,006
and "Aw, happy ending,"
or... they name someone else,

736
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,664
and expose their dirty,

737
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,732
cheating ways.

738
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:50,904
Oh, it's so juicy.

739
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:52,801
So it turns out, both couples

740
00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:54,771
had a significant other
that appeared on the show.

741
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,971
So we're assuming

742
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:58,540
that our killer listens
to this juvenile program?

743
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:00,209
We've narrowed our
suspects down to anyone

744
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:02,845
who doesn't have satellite
radio, and Ms. Lopez.

745
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:04,847
Actually, the addresses are beeped out.

746
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:07,249
Probably for reasons like this.

747
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:10,068
Okay, so the killer has to be
somebody that works on the show.

748
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:11,732
Someone with access to this info?

749
00:29:11,735 --> 00:29:14,423
Right. So we need to
make ourselves the target,

750
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:15,602
and flush the killer out.

751
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:17,558
Great idea. Decker and I will do it.

752
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:18,839
We'll give out my home address

753
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,107
and lure the killer there.

754
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,096
Sure.

755
00:29:21,098 --> 00:29:23,365
- That could work.
- Oh, man.

756
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,233
You guys are totally gonna
be the cheating lovers.

757
00:29:25,235 --> 00:29:27,802
Marvelous. Well, since
that's been sorted,

758
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:29,772
I assume my services
are no longer needed.

759
00:29:29,774 --> 00:29:31,106
Uh, actually,

760
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:33,121
there is one more piece

761
00:29:33,124 --> 00:29:34,623
of the sting we'll need.

762
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:37,452
And we are here with our
jilted lover, Lucifer.

763
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:38,888
Now, first off,

764
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:41,318
what is up with that
name? "Lucifer"? I-I...

765
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,318
You think maybe

766
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,416
that is part of the reason
that's driving a wedge

767
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:45,685
between you and your old lady?

768
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:48,401
Well, first off, I am
not a "jilted lover."

769
00:29:48,404 --> 00:29:50,904
No, no. No one ever wants
to believe that, do they?

770
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:53,134
But you wouldn't be here
if you probably didn't think

771
00:29:53,137 --> 00:29:54,670
something was going on, right?

772
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:56,665
And we're gonna find
out exactly what that is

773
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:58,100
when we come back.

774
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:00,929
You're doing great, by the way.

775
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,565
You're late!

776
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:05,532
Yeah, sorry I'm late.
Traffic was just awful.

777
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:07,076
Stop.

778
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,978
I ordered a pastrami.

779
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,188
Is this pastrami? No,
it is not pastrami!

780
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:13,615
Now get out of here!

781
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:16,459
And we are back with our guest Lucifer,

782
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:19,087
who is now gonna tell us
all about his girl Chloe.

783
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:24,540
Uh, right. Well, um, she's my partner.

784
00:30:24,543 --> 00:30:25,642
At work.

785
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:27,545
Oh, so it's a workplace thing, huh?

786
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:29,248
When did things change?

787
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:32,901
Well, she's been spending quite
a bit of time with our new boss.

788
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:34,961
Cheating on you with the boss?

789
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:36,263
Oh, that's low.

790
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:37,473
Well, it's quite a bit more complex

791
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:39,751
than your obnoxious
braying's making it out to be.

792
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,452
Well, let's find out, shall we?

793
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:43,686
Let's get Chloe on the line.

794
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:45,256
Uh, yes?

795
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:46,936
Uh, hello, uh, Chloe?

796
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:49,146
Uh, this is, uh, Pop Sugar.

797
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:52,009
We are a new Swiss
chocolate shop in Los Feliz,

798
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:54,279
and we are, uh, running a big promotion.

799
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:57,017
Yeah, we are going to send,
uh, a free box of chocolates

800
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,353
to, uh, your special someone,

801
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:01,256
if you have a special someone somewhere?

802
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,664
Oh, wow.

803
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,256
Wow, yeah, that's awesome. Um...

804
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,368
and-and actually, it's perfect timing.

805
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:08,943
Um, as we're having,
um, a date night tonight.

806
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:10,172
Oh! Wonderful.

807
00:31:10,174 --> 00:31:12,568
All we need, then, is
his name and address.

808
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:15,943
Yeah, his name is
Marcus, and he lives at...

809
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:19,865
Okay, Chloe, that is good.

810
00:31:19,868 --> 00:31:21,138
Listen, I'm just curious,

811
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:23,740
because we're all such romantics here,

812
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:26,670
what is it about, uh, t-this, uh, guy

813
00:31:26,673 --> 00:31:28,607
that gives you the goose bumps?

814
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,504
Uh...

815
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:32,873
um...

816
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,529
well, he's, um...

817
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:37,599
he's...

818
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,334
he's very handsome.

819
00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:42,404
Yeah, but isn't there anything,
uh, more than just looks?

820
00:31:42,406 --> 00:31:45,185
Um, well, he's very brave,

821
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:48,834
and we both care about
the same sorts of things,

822
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:51,045
like, well, doing what's right,

823
00:31:51,048 --> 00:31:53,415
and, uh, and helping other people.

824
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,854
I think he's a good person.

825
00:31:55,857 --> 00:31:57,390
Sounds like a hell of a guy.

826
00:31:57,393 --> 00:31:59,943
Uh, and we'll make sure
to get that package to him

827
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:02,491
uh, before the end of the night.

828
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:04,460
Okay, thanks.

829
00:32:04,462 --> 00:32:07,107
And there you have it, everyone.

830
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,629
Another cheater exposed.

831
00:32:09,632 --> 00:32:11,365
Sometimes, chocolate can be dark,

832
00:32:11,368 --> 00:32:12,615
but you know what?

833
00:32:12,618 --> 00:32:14,536
Isn't better to always
know the... truth?

834
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:16,282
Where the hell did he go?

835
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,850
Welcome to my humble abode.

836
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:27,352
Um...

837
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:28,521
I like rocks.

838
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:31,194
You have a rock collection?

839
00:32:31,197 --> 00:32:33,037
Well, the thing about
rocks is they're old.

840
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,690
They never change.

841
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:37,559
I've taken one from all
the places I've visited.

842
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:41,045
You've been a lot of places, huh?

843
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:43,866
Well, gather no moss and all that.

844
00:32:43,868 --> 00:32:45,868
I know I don't have a lot of things,

845
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,705
but what I love about this
place is the killer view.

846
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:53,342
Oh, my God.

847
00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:55,244
This is beautiful.

848
00:32:57,348 --> 00:32:58,716
Decker, listen.

849
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:01,639
I know that our, uh,
opportunity for a second date

850
00:33:01,642 --> 00:33:02,875
was interrupted earlier.

851
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:05,299
Hopefully this will make up for it.

852
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:07,115
Hey, you guys all set?

853
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,215
Hey, Dan. Yeah. We're all set here.

854
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:14,115
Coast is clear on my end.

855
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:17,480
Ah, excellent. Daniel. You're here.

856
00:33:17,483 --> 00:33:19,716
Hey, pal. I didn't know you
were coming in for this one.

857
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:23,621
I wasn't, but, um, I
wanted to ask you something.

858
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:24,990
Okay.

859
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,592
How did you move on from the detective

860
00:33:27,594 --> 00:33:29,302
when I showed up and replaced you?

861
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:31,930
And please, don't say improv.

862
00:33:31,932 --> 00:33:34,085
- You didn't replace me.
- Well, true, true.

863
00:33:34,088 --> 00:33:36,107
I suppose that would imply
we're on the same level.

864
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,970
Look, I get it. All right?

865
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:41,155
I get how you feel with this
whole Pierce and Chloe thing.

866
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:43,275
- Mm.
- And, yes,

867
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,654
I admit, I did feel a little
jealous when you showed up.

868
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,209
Well, justifiably so.

869
00:33:48,212 --> 00:33:51,006
But then I realized
you had nothing to do

870
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:52,243
with why my marriage ended.

871
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:53,779
You and I are different people.

872
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,687
We each have our own
relationship with Chloe.

873
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:57,690
Once I came to terms
with that, I was fine.

874
00:34:01,128 --> 00:34:02,627
I hope you don't mind.

875
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:05,430
I asked Lopez what
your favorite dish was.

876
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:09,457
No, it's, um, it's great.

877
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,704
Is something wrong?

878
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:14,239
Um...

879
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:17,776
um, Marcus, maybe we shouldn't do this.

880
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:19,678
Are we too visible?

881
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,513
No.

882
00:34:21,515 --> 00:34:23,315
- Is the plan too obvious?
- No, no, no.

883
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:24,849
I mean you and me.

884
00:34:24,852 --> 00:34:27,276
You know, we work together
and things could get weird.

885
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:28,545
That's all.

886
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:30,682
Look, you asked me out first, Decker.

887
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:35,593
I, uh... I did

888
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:37,395
and you turned me down.

889
00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:42,000
And I... I was disappointed,
but, you know, I got it.

890
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:44,636
And you're the one who
said you're, you know,

891
00:34:44,638 --> 00:34:46,105
"not relationship material."

892
00:34:47,441 --> 00:34:51,843
You're a good man and I really like you,

893
00:34:51,845 --> 00:34:56,514
but I, uh, I-I need
somebody who can let me in

894
00:34:56,516 --> 00:35:00,252
and I just don't know if that's... you.

895
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,963
Hello, shadowy figure.

896
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,133
Here to spoil the date?

897
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:19,471
God! God!

898
00:35:19,473 --> 00:35:22,040
LAPD. You're under arrest.

899
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:23,742
I know my rights, okay?

900
00:35:23,744 --> 00:35:26,608
Fair use, I want a lawyer.

901
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:28,543
Pastrami boy?

902
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:30,553
- You're the killer?
- Killer? What?

903
00:35:30,556 --> 00:35:32,832
What are you talking about?
Dude, I'm here for the show.

904
00:35:32,835 --> 00:35:34,715
- What show?
- The show, the show.

905
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:37,652
I-I-I try to film an angry
ex busting in on their spouse.

906
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:40,093
Like you and then I
put it up on my Web site

907
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,921
as a bootleg after show. Hey!

908
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:45,543
Hey, look, I'm trying
to be a producer, man.

909
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,098
The only reason I'm interning

910
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,344
is so I can get access to those tapes

911
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,817
and I post those tapes raw
and unedited on my Web site.

912
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,186
Unedited?

913
00:35:52,189 --> 00:35:53,683
Without the addresses censored out?

914
00:35:53,686 --> 00:35:55,660
Well, yeah, I mean,
that's what unedited means.

915
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:57,396
I'm showing life at its most raw.

916
00:35:59,487 --> 00:36:00,925
Ow.

917
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:03,190
The killer could be
listening to those tapes.

918
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:04,760
Could be anyone.

919
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:43,687
Maybe I should've
waited until after dinner

920
00:36:43,689 --> 00:36:45,456
to say all that.

921
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:46,970
No, you're right.

922
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:48,473
I do have walls up.

923
00:36:48,476 --> 00:36:51,128
I've had them up for a long, long time.

924
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,728
When I feel like someone's

925
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:54,865
getting past them, I run.

926
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:58,670
But with you, Chloe, I don't
want those walls up anymore.

927
00:36:58,673 --> 00:37:00,371
I don't want to run anymore.

928
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:02,973
You deserve someone
who's gonna let you in

929
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:05,209
and I want to do that if
you'll give me the chance.

930
00:37:05,211 --> 00:37:07,645
That's...

931
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:11,523
Chloe?

932
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:16,219
You all right?

933
00:37:16,222 --> 00:37:17,654
Chloe!

934
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,425
Chloe.

935
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:59,252
You shouldn't have hurt him.

936
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:04,230
Too bad.

937
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,967
If you'd started with him,
I would've let you swing.

938
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,339
You... you're the... you're
the guy from the radio.

939
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:11,001
Yes, and you're the chap

940
00:38:11,004 --> 00:38:12,676
who bought the original killer's house.

941
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:14,445
How remarkably method of you.

942
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,046
Don't-don't-don't you get it?

943
00:38:16,048 --> 00:38:17,748
I-I-I-I did this for you.

944
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,764
I-I... these-these two,
they-they-they betrayed you.

945
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,619
I didn't ask for this.

946
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:23,693
But you deserve it.

947
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:25,193
I found Hoffman's journals

948
00:38:25,196 --> 00:38:26,557
hidden in the attic.

949
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,428
He understood how hard it is
to lose someone you care about.

950
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:30,661
We wanted to show the world

951
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:32,759
that you-you can't just leave people.

952
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:38,274
You don't get to decide who
someone wants to be with.

953
00:38:42,107 --> 00:38:43,842
And neither do I.

954
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:48,313
Does this mean you're-you're
not, you're not gonna...

955
00:38:50,623 --> 00:38:52,591
Detective.

956
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:59,498
Oh, my God. Are they okay?

957
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:02,326
They're fine. They're fine.

958
00:39:02,328 --> 00:39:04,094
Come on. Wakey-wakey, Detective.

959
00:39:04,096 --> 00:39:06,096
Come on, pal.

960
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:08,833
Lieutenant Pierce.

961
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:18,705
I've got a wake-up for Charlotte.

962
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:33,178
You are following me.

963
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:36,256
No, this-this is, this is just
where I come to read the paper.

964
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:38,600
I know when people are lying to me.

965
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:42,032
Honestly, this is just,
um, all... it's really...

966
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:43,743
all a big misunderstanding.

967
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:49,310
So all the crazy stuff
you said earlier...

968
00:39:49,313 --> 00:39:51,076
is a misunderstanding?

969
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:53,745
Please, I just...

970
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,715
You don't understand what it's like

971
00:39:59,718 --> 00:40:01,607
not remembering what you did,

972
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,421
not knowing who you were.

973
00:40:04,423 --> 00:40:09,026
All I want is the truth.

974
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:11,397
How do we know each other?

975
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,587
You were my mom.

976
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,587
I know.

977
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:22,138
I know.

978
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:25,442
Please, have a seat.

979
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:29,214
There is, uh, there
is so much to explain.

980
00:40:42,328 --> 00:40:44,461
Olga? Wait, I'm sorry.

981
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:47,225
I thought that Maze was
gonna be here watching Trixie.

982
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:48,699
No Maze.

983
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:52,652
She said mean thing
to me and then she go.

984
00:40:52,655 --> 00:40:54,740
What do you mean, "she go"?

985
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:58,075
She take her knives and she move out.

986
00:40:58,077 --> 00:41:00,711
Oh.

987
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:03,213
Thank you, Olga.

988
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:04,916
I know. Thank you, though.

989
00:41:13,058 --> 00:41:14,998
Olga, did you forget something?

990
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:16,226
Well, that's a new one.

991
00:41:16,228 --> 00:41:18,128
Never been mistaken for an Olga before.

992
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:22,165
What are you doing here?

993
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:25,402
I, um...

994
00:41:25,404 --> 00:41:27,264
I wanted to explain.

995
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:30,073
- Look, I know that I've been acting...
- Insecure.

996
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:32,476
Childish. Possessive.

997
00:41:32,478 --> 00:41:34,154
Well, I was going to
say strangely, but...

998
00:41:34,157 --> 00:41:36,209
never mind.

999
00:41:36,212 --> 00:41:39,828
The truth is that perhaps
I was slightly insecure

1000
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,264
about Pierce moving
in on our partnership.

1001
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,912
Oh, Lucifer, that's
not what's happening.

1002
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:44,955
No, I know,

1003
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:47,209
because I've realized that
there's room in your life

1004
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:50,927
for all sorts of relationships,

1005
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:54,443
even if one of them is with... with him.

1006
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:56,333
- I know...
- Just...

1007
00:41:56,335 --> 00:41:58,927
please, be careful.

1008
00:42:01,634 --> 00:42:03,680
Okay.

1009
00:42:03,683 --> 00:42:06,350
Do you want to stay?
I can make some coffee

1010
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:08,612
- and we can...
- Ah, I can't, unfortunately.

1011
00:42:08,614 --> 00:42:12,049
There's a bachelorette
party at Lux and... well.

1012
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:14,221
Okay, another time.

1013
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:15,691
Yes.

1014
00:42:17,456 --> 00:42:20,725
Okay, well... have fun.

1015
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:39,623
Dinner sounds great.

1016
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:40,911
How about tomorrow?

1017
00:42:40,913 --> 00:42:43,201
- That's perfect.
- Good. I'll pick you up at 7:00?

1018
00:42:43,204 --> 00:42:45,683
- Yeah.
- I'll see you then, Chloe.

1019
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:50,725
Someone special, I assume?

1020
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:52,539
Yes, she is.

1021
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:55,363
And for the first time of
my life I'm gonna go for it.

1022
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,500
Good for you.

1023
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:59,085
You have to risk the broken
heart if you wonna get something

1024
00:42:59,088 --> 00:43:00,452
out of this life, right?

1025
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:02,898
That's not my heart of risking.

1026
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:05,799
She's the key to finally
getting what I've always wanted.
