<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:04,865
Sheldon, did you just figure out

3
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:08,135
a method for synthesizing a new
stable super-heavy element?

4
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:09,939
Did I?!

5
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:11,207
Well, that can't be right.

6
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:12,908
No one's ever done that before.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,376
Except me because I just did it!

8
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:16,545
♪ Sheldon and his brain, yeah

9
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:18,581
♪ Sheldon and his brain,
yeah! ♪

10
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,949
I've made a horrible mistake.

11
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:22,051
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:24,786
This table,
it's in square centimeters

13
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:26,805
I read it as square meters.

14
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:28,257
You know what that means?

15
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,843
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,265
Amy, I was off
by a factor of 10,000.

17
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:38,684
But the Chinese team
found the element.

18
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:39,652
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

19
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:41,604
My calculations were wrong.

20
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:43,572
The greatest scientific
achievement of my life

21
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:45,307
is based on a blunder.

22
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:46,609
I'm not a genius.

23
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:47,943
I'm a fraud.

24
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:50,112
You know, Sheldon,
in neuroscience,

25
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:52,814
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

26
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:54,283
that we thought was
someplace else.

27
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:56,985
Oh, great, now I'm
worse than a fraud.

28
00:00:56,987 --> 00:00:59,154
I'm practically a biologist.

29
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:04,260
This is <i>Science Friday.</i>
I'm Ira Flatow.

30
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:07,596
My guest today is responsible
for the discovery of the first

31
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:10,165
stable super-heavy element.

32
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:11,684
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

33
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,435
Thank you.

34
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:15,020
Uh, the university
made me come here.

35
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:16,505
I didn't want to.

36
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:20,359
Uh, big fan of the show.

37
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:23,345
So, I understand
that you actually discovered

38
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:25,531
this element by mistake.

39
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,483
(sighs heavily)

40
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,318
Yes.

41
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,371
And some people in the science
community are calling it

42
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:34,356
"The Wonder Blunder."

43
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:36,024
Who? Give me their names.

44
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:37,910
I bet it's Wolowitz.

45
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:40,296
It's just such
a fascinating story.

46
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:41,830
Your calculations are way off,

47
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:44,199
but they find
the element anyway.

48
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:46,502
It's like misreading
a treasure map

49
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:48,921
and still finding the treasure.

50
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,923
Can we talk
about something else?

51
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,509
Do you know that I yodel?

52
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,229
That's interesting,
but this could be taking you

53
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:59,982
down the path
toward a Nobel Prize.

54
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,350
And in chemistry, no less.

55
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,502
And wouldn't
that be unusual?

56
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:05,854
Because you're a physicist.

57
00:02:05,856 --> 00:02:08,157
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist
with a Nobel in chemistry.

58
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,359
Everyone laugh
at the circus freak.

59
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:14,163
You know, I don't need to sit
here and take this, Flatow.

60
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,498
It is because of bullies
like you,

61
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,200
every day
more and more Americans

62
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:20,703

President Seibert, I don't
know why you're yelling.

74
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:56,179
You're the one who made me
go on the radio.

75
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:59,016
I was expecting a professional
science interview,

76
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:02,836
not an attack
by some morning zoo shock jock.

77
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:06,239
Well, if the university
needs money so badly,

78
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:09,026
perhaps you should start
a swear jar.

79
00:03:10,328 --> 00:03:13,363
Whoa! That one's worth a dollar.

80
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:16,033
I know you don't like it,

81
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:17,367
but every time
you do an interview,

82
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:19,402
it raises the profile
of the university.

83
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:21,071
That translates to funding.

84
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,089
Yeah, well, I'm not just

85
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:25,909
some trained monkey
dancing for coins.

86
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:27,010
Of course you're not.

87
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:29,046
People love trained monkeys.

88
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:32,299
How can you not be happy?

89
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,017
You're tall, thin and famous.

90
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,137
Oh, my God,
I'm jealous of Sheldon.

91
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,973
Look, you're gonna be doing
this stuff for a while.

92
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:42,359
You're just gonna have to find
a way to get used to it.

93
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,260
But none of you know
what this is like.

94
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:47,430
Being celebrated for something
you wish you never did.

95
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:50,650
Mmm... you clearly haven't been
with me at Mardi Gras.

96
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:56,289
Want to pause the video game
and help me clean up?

97
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,457
I am cleaning up.

98
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,876
Look at the mess the Joker made
of Gotham City.

99
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,914
Come on, it's your friend
who's coming to stay here.

100
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,298
Raj grew up in India.

101
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,634
Trust me, he's seen worse.

102
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:09,452
Howie.

103
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:10,637
I promise I'll help out

104
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,671
the rest of the week.

105
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:12,806
The rest of the week?

106
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:14,624
You said it was just gonna be
a night or two.

107
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,675
Yeah, but if I told you a week,

108
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:16,593
would you have said yes?

109
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:20,347
No!
Then you left me no choice.

110
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:24,017
I love Raj, but that's
a long time for a house guest.

111
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:25,685
I know, but they're
tenting his building.

112
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:28,071
He can't find a hotel
he likes that allows dogs.

113
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:29,639
He's bringing Cinnamon?

114
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:30,640
For a whole week!

115
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:32,659
The nerve of some people.

116
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:39,116
Here comes
the Embarrassment Express.

117
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:42,586
With stops at Fraudville...

118
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:45,088
WonderBlunderberg...

119
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,041
and Kansas City.

120
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:49,309
Because it's a hub.

121
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:51,812
(knocking on door)

122
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:53,280
AMY:
Sheldon, can I come in?

123
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:54,931
Do you have cookies?
No.

124
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,883
Good. I don't deserve cookies.
Come in.

125
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,170
Wil...?

126
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:01,104
Hey, Sheldon.

127
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:02,022
It's been a while.

128
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:03,523
Why are you here?

129
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:04,558
Amy said you were
having a rough time,

130
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,143
and I thought maybe
we could talk.

131
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:07,010
Is that okay?

132
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:08,645
Certainly.

133
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:09,679
Although...

134
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:11,231
right now,
I'm having a rough time

135
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:12,899
because there's
three people in my room,

136
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:15,919
and it's starting to feel
like a discotheque.

137
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,573
Sheldon, you said you were
unhappy getting attention

138
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:21,858
for something you wished
you never did.

139
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,693
Yeah, I know a little
something about that.

140
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:25,745
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

141
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:29,299
Your endless tweets are
not that bad.

142
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:31,718
I remember why
it's been a while.

143
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,171
Sheldon, I was actually talking

144
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:35,872
about when I was a kid
on <i>Star Trek.</i>

145
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:38,391
How could you not
like getting attention

146
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:39,876
for playing Wesley Crusher?

147
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:41,995
You were wonderful.

148
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:44,731
A know-it-all boy genius
with an eidetic memory.

149
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:47,567
Who couldn't relate to that?

150
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:50,237
Well, not everybody
felt that way.

151
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,988
A lot of people
really hated the character,

152
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,241
and some of them
hated me because of it.

153
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:55,225
I would do interviews,

154
00:05:55,227 --> 00:05:56,893
and people would be mean to me.

155
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:59,162
That just happened to me.

156
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:00,914
Next time you're stuck
for a tweet,

157
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,201
feel free to say
what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

158
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:07,287
Sheldon, the point is
Wil learned to embrace

159
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:10,573
that part of his life and moved
on to bigger and better things.

160
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:12,075
WHEATON:
Yeah, I'm an author now,

161
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:13,627
I do public speaking,

162
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:15,795
and I have my own Web series
about board games.

163
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:17,180
Uh...

164
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,049
We're trying
to cheer him up, so...

165
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:20,416
(clicks tongue)

166
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,022
I'm just saying
that there was a time

167
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:28,525
when I thought I would never get
out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

168
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:29,859
But now,

169
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:32,312
it's just one small part
of a pretty great life,

170
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:34,430
and it's a part
that I'm happy is there.

171
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,733
I do see what you're saying.

172
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:38,235
That helps.

173
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:39,369
Good.

174
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,604
Would you two like to stay

175
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:41,638
and play trains with me?

176
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,706
Sure.
Okay.

177
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,773
Oh, great!

178
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:47,110
Now...
(clears throat)

179
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:48,111
I work the controls.

180
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:49,296
I say "All aboard""

181
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:52,282
You sit quietly and watch.

182
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:54,384
Can I blow the whistle?

183
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:57,754
You should probably go.

184
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:07,414
You're gonna brush
your teeth on my couch?

185
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,567
No, I'm gonna brush
Cinnamon's teeth.

186
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:11,685
Why bother?

187
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:12,819
She spends half the time

188
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:14,321
licking her butt.

189
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:16,740
And the other half
licking my face.

190
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:18,808
That's why I'm brushing
her teeth.

191
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:22,645
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm so late.

192
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:23,646
Did you already have dinner?

193
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,248
No, we were waiting for you.

194
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,499
Aw, that's so sweet.

195
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,752
Yeah. So what do you
feel like making?

196
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:31,504
Howard, the poor thing

197
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:32,505
just got home from work.

198
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:34,657
Let me get you a glass of wine.

199
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,176
I'll cook dinner.

200
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:38,128
Oh, Raj, you're our guest.
KOOTHRAPPALI: Don't be silly.

201
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,163
Sit. You look
like you've had a long day.

202
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:43,149
No, she always
looks like that.

203
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,938
Because she married an idiot.

204
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,591
Thank you, Raj.

205
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:52,809
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Please, this is

206
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:54,527
my way of thanking you

207
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:56,363
for letting me stay here.

208
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:59,316
Now, tell us all about your day.

209
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:01,318
Okay, um, well, first,

210
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,286
I was late to a meeting
'cause I was stuck in traffic.

211
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:06,289
Well, I keep telling you to put
that traffic app on your phone.

212
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,191
Hey, when you got home today
complaining that you felt sick

213
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:09,525
from eating
too many jelly beans,

214
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:10,660
did I tell you how to fix it?

215
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:11,861
No.

216
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:17,533
I said, "Aw, that must hurt,"
and I rubbed your belly.

217
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:23,089
I thought of you
the whole time.

218
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:28,178
All I'm saying is there's
a time to just listen.

219
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,512
Thank you.

220
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:30,597
There's also a time to stop

221
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,681
eating too many jelly beans.

222
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:33,850
And it's when you're ten.

223
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:38,254
Hello, President Siebert.

224
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,773
Thank you for taking my call.

225
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:42,575
I just wanted you to know
that you can now expect

226
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:46,413
enthusiastic participation
from me regarding my discovery.

227
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:47,697
Oh, no, no, no, no.

228
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:48,998
No need to thank me.

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,785
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

230
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:55,004
For your information,
I have nine friends, hmm?

231
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:59,409
Ten if we include you.

232
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,594
Nine it is.

233
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:06,182
Ah, it's ten.

234
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:08,017
I'll count Wolowitz.

235
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,770
Hello, friend Leonard.

236
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:12,055
Hey, you're in a good mood.

237
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:14,023
I'm in a great mood.

238
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,892
Well, you're about to be
in an even better one.

239
00:09:15,894 --> 00:09:17,260
I didn't want
to say anything

240
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:18,645
until I knew for sure, but...

241
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:21,364
I've been re-running the tests
on your element in my lab

242
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,899
and I disproved it.

243
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:24,701
Your element does not exist!

244
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,470
Yeah, but what about
the Chinese research team?

245
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:28,571
They found it.

246
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:29,956
Yeah, it turns out someone added

247
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,442
simulated signals
to the data files.

248
00:09:32,444 --> 00:09:34,127
They faked the results.

249
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,128
Really?

250
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,863
Yes! Do you know
what that means?

251
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:39,883
That means all of this attention
that you hate goes away.

252
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:41,117
So no more interviews?

253
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,118
No, it's all over.

254
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,219
I can't believe it.

255
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:44,120
Well, you're welcome.

256
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:45,121
You robbed me

257
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:47,056
of my greatest achievement!

258
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:49,008
What?!

259
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,811
I'm back down
to nine friends!

260
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:55,231
Make it eight--
I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

261
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,734
I-I don't understand.

262
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:59,352
All you've done
since you discovered

263
00:09:59,354 --> 00:10:00,770
this stupid element
was complain.

264
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:02,105
I was trying to make you happy!

265
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,741
By taking away
my only claim to fame?

266
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:06,409
Well, if you wanted
to make me happy,

267
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:07,827
you could have told me a joke.

268
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:09,112
Or shown me a cute video

269
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:11,147
of a koala and an otter

270
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:12,648
becoming unlikely friends.

271
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,035
Oh, there is
no winning with you.

272
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,421
And koalas and otters don't
even live near each other!

273
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:21,424
That's what makes
their friendship unlikely!

274
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,042
Hey!

275
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:24,344
What's with all the yelling?

276
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:26,429
Leonard disproved my element.

277
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,765
Now all the attention
is going to go away.

278
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,266
Oh, that's great.
You must be thrilled!

279
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:33,686
That's it!
I'm down to seven friends.

280
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:37,390
He's counting hobbits
and superheroes, right?

281
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:40,643
When I thought the element
was real, I didn't want it.

282
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,479
But now that Leonard
made it not exist,

283
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,981
I want it more
than anything in the world.

284
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:46,566
The-the element never existed.

285
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:48,351
I didn't take it away,
science took it away.

286
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:49,452
Be mad at science.

287
00:10:49,454 --> 00:10:52,455
Don't you dare use
science against me.

288
00:10:52,457 --> 00:10:54,991
Science is my best friend!

289
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:56,459
Oh, good,
I'm back up to eight.

290
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:00,046
Will you tell him
he's out of his mind.

291
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:01,347
Actually, I get
what he's saying.

292
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:02,715
Oh, yes! Nine!

293
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:03,716
Welcome back, buddy.

294
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:08,037
It's like if you're dating
someone you're not that into,

295
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,305
and then they break up with you

296
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:10,723
and then you want them
more than ever.

297
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:12,425
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

298
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:15,812
but we're ganged up
on you so I agree.

299
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:18,881
Okay, Sheldon, what do you
want me to do,

300
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,483
hide the information?

301
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:21,851
If I don't publish it,

302
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:23,236
it's just a matter of time
before someone else does.

303
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:25,021
No, no, of course
you have to publish.

304
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,956
That's your responsibility
as a scientist.

305
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,608
Doing otherwise
would be unethical.

306
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,892
You have no choice.

307
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:31,661
Fine, I'll publish.

308
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:33,363
Can you believe this guy?

309
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,480
Aw! Raj did the dishes.

310
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:47,032
How do you know
I didn't do them?

311
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:48,767
Because once, when all
the knives were dirty,

312
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:51,603
you cut a bagel with your keys.

313
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,873
Good morning, everybody.

314
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,008
I picked up coffee
while I was out.

315
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,628
Bernadette, here's
your soy peppermint mocha.

316
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,797
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

317
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,931
Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry

318
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:03,999
about your presentation today.

319
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,217
You're gonna be great.

320
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:07,419
Yeah, you're gonna
knock it out of the park.

321
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,621
What presentation
do I have today?

322
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:12,674
Just go.

323
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:18,180
He loves you.

324
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:19,147
What are you doing?

325
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:20,599
Are you trying
to make me look bad?

326
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:22,133
I'm just being
a good house guest.

327
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:23,602
No, you're being
a better husband than I am.

328
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:25,353
Doing the dishes,
getting coffee,

329
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:26,571
knowing about her life--

330
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:28,473
who does that?

331
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:31,109
Oh, come on,
I brought you one, too.

332
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:32,794
I don't want coffee.

333
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:34,246
That's why I got you
hot chocolate.

334
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:36,331
Give me that.

335
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,034
Just stop showing me up.

336
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:40,585
Howard, listen to me.

337
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:41,986
You're a great husband.

338
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:44,589
Yes, your listening skills
could use some work.

339
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:47,793
But it's amazing how far
you've come given that you're

340
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:51,263
an only child raised
by an over-protective mom.

341
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,882
Um, is this getting weird?

342
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:54,933
Hang on.

343
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:02,224
So, yes.

344
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:05,594
(knocking on door)
LEONARD: Hey.

345
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:07,946
I just wanted to let you know
that I-I posted my findings.

346
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:09,180
I saw.

347
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:10,532
And I just

348
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:12,617
posted a retraction of my paper.

349
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:15,620
Now the whole scientific
community knows I was wrong.

350
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:18,290
These things happen
all the time, Sheldon.

351
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,457
Not to me.

352
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:21,543
The only other retraction
I ever had to issue

353
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:24,212
was when I was seven
and I conceded that my brother

354
00:13:24,214 --> 00:13:26,915
was the greatest ninja
in East Texas.

355
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,448
But that was just a ploy to get
my face out of his armpit.

356
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:34,055
There he is!

357
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,808
It's my favorite superhero--

358
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,594
the Retractor!

359
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,398
Come on, don't give him
a hard time.

360
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,683
I'm sorry, Cooper.

361
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:46,885
I retract it.

362
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,654
By the way, Hofstadter,

363
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:52,190
nice job disproving
the Chinese team.

364
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:53,275
It's not a big deal.

365
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:54,910
It's a huge deal.

366
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:57,896
Cooper, maybe physics
just isn't your thing.

367
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:00,749
Have you ever considered
a career in retail?

368
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:04,002
That way you could take
things back for a living.

369
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:06,504
Okay, Barry, that's enough.

370
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:07,906
Oh, no, that's okay.

371
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:09,875
I can fight my own battles.

372
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:12,961
Isn't that right, "Bawwy."

373
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,431
Is...?

374
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:19,017
Is that a reference
to my speech impediment?

375
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,054
That's pretty hurtful.

376
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:24,472
I...

377
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:26,474
I can't control it.

378
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:29,027
You're right,

379
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,062
That was uncalled for.

380
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,480
I take it back.

381
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:33,448
Of course you do.

382
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,450
Because you're the Retractor!

383
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:41,990
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

384
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:43,107
If you're here much longer,

385
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:45,126
I'm gonna have
to buy bigger clothes.

386
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:46,110
Nonsense.

387
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:47,295
You need
a little fattening up.

388
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:49,280
You've been looking
too skinny lately.

389
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:50,615
Aw.

390
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:53,134
Howie, how come you never
say anything sweet like that?

391
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:54,118
What are you talking about?

392
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,337
Remember last week,
when I asked you

393
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:56,721
if you were wearing Spanx
and you weren't?

394
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:59,007
How's that different?

395
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:02,010
Maybe you could try being
more thoughtful,

396
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:03,628
like your friend Raj.

397
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,147
Yeah, well, maybe you could
try being more like Raj.

398
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:07,232
Oh, really?

399
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,149
Yeah, yeah.

400
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:09,567
He packed me
a lunch this morning.

401
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:12,771
And there was a note inside
that said, "Go get 'em""

402
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:15,357
Like I don't do enough
around here.

403
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,658
Now I need
to pack your lunch?

404
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,309
And by the way, why do you need
a note telling you

405
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:19,744
to "go get 'em"?
You're a grown man!

406
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,079
You should know to "go get 'em"!

407
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,365
I do know to "go get 'em""

408
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:25,050
but sometimes it's nice
to have emotional support

409
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:27,485
when I'm going and getting them!

410
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,921
Hey, hey, do you
hear yourselves?

411
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:33,208
Let's just, you know, all calm
down and take a step back.

412
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,310
This is stupid.

413
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:36,511
Why are we fighting?

414
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:37,545
I don't know.

415
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:38,997
I guess I was just feeling

416
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:40,832
like I'm a lousy husband.

417
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,350
You're not a lousy husband.

418
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:43,635
You're a great husband.

419
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:45,887
I was the one feeling
like a lousy wife.

420
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,139
Are you kidding?
You're the best.

421
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:49,691
I know what the problem is.

422
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:51,376
It's him!

423
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:54,312
Oh, what did I do?

424
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:56,681
You made us feel like we're
not trying hard enough.

425
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,349
Yeah, we were totally fine
half-assing our marriage

426
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:00,251
till you showed up.

427
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:02,954
Look, I'm sorry
you're upset with me,

428
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:04,656
but I just have to say
it's nice to see

429
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:06,190
the two of you on the same page.

430
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:07,859
Oh, it does feel good

431
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:09,461
to have you backing
me up for once.

432
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:11,778
I back you up all the time!
That is not...

433
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:14,146
He's doing it again!
What is wrong with you?!

434
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:17,419
I can't believe
they kicked you out.

435
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:21,056
I can't believe
they're still married.

436
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:24,559
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's
toothbrush at Howard's.

437
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:27,312
I guess you're sharing
with Daddy again.

438
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:34,736
(whispering): Bark once if you need me
to call PETA.

439
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:40,325
What's that animal doing
in our apartment?

440
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:42,610
Oh, relax, she's in her crate.
She can't get out.

441
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:44,329
I have two words for you:

442
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,364
<i>Jurassic Park.</i>

443
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:49,584
This day just keeps
getting worse and worse.

444
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:51,119
You know, if it makes
you feel any better...

445
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:52,087
It probably won't.

446
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:53,204
You're probably right.

447
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:56,257
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

448
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,877
Why don't you and I
go for a nice walk together?

449
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,429
Oh, everything is just sex
with you isn't it?

450
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:05,517
Sheldon, I think
you might find the support

451
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,085
you're looking for,
if you realize

452
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:09,304
that relationships
are a give and take.

453
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:10,755
She can only be there for you

454
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,640
as much as you are for her.

455
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,442
Thank you, Rajesh.

456
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:16,761
And, Amy, you need
to be patient with Sheldon,

457
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:20,482
instead of pressuring him to
accept intimacy on your terms.

458
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,768
You should probably go.

459
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,092
I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is <i>Science Friday.</i>

460
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:38,194
I'd like to welcome back
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

461
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:40,280
who thought
he had discovered

462
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:43,032
a new super-heavy element
only to have it disproved

463
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:45,485
by my next guest,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

464
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:46,619
Welcome to <i>Science</i> Friday,
gentlemen.

465
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,071
Thanks.
Thank you.

466
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,707
Ira, if I may,
I'd like to apologize

467
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:52,742
for my behavior last week.

468
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:54,327
It's all right.

469
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,714
Now, isn't there something
you'd like to say to me?

470
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,667
No.

471
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:03,169
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

472
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:04,554
Can you walk us
through the process

473
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:06,422
you used to disprove his theory?

474
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:09,142
Well...
I believe I can answer that.

475
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,094
He asked me.

476
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:12,312
Fine.

477
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:13,346
As I was saying...

478
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:14,814
You're telling it wrong.
Ira...

479
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:16,816
to really understand
the story here,

480
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:18,401
you have to start
at the very beginning:

481
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:21,437
A small town in East Texas,
where a young genius named...

482
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,306
Sheldon...
That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

483
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:26,576
He was bitten
by his neighbor's dog,

484
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:28,494
leading to his first
scientific breakthrough--

485
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:30,747
the doggie death-ray.

486
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:33,116
Which, sadly, he couldn't build

487
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,985
because Santa wouldn't bring him
enriched uranium.

488
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:38,755
I mean, I'd really like
to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

489
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:40,039
if it's okay with you.

490
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,991
What a surprise.

491
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:44,677
Did-did you invite me back
just so you could ignore me?

492
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,512
Actually, I didn't invite you.

493
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:47,997
You came in, you took a seat,

494
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:51,017
and I'm not comfortable
with confrontation.

495
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:55,121
LEONARD: Sheldon, this interview
is supposed to be about me.

496
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:57,323
SHELDON:
Well, that seems like a snooze.

497
00:18:57,325 --> 00:19:00,093
Even for public radio.

498
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:01,928
You know, if we did
a shot every time

499
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,129
they said something
embarrassing,

500
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:05,281
this would be one hell
of a drinking game.

501
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:07,467
A little early
for alcohol, isn't it?

502
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,352
SHELDON: You know, I don't just say smart
things about science.

503
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:10,853
I also yodel.

504
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:14,057
(Sheldon yodeling)

505
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,826
I'll get the vodka.
