00:00:06,324 --> 00:00:07,324
What container?

4
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:08,653
The container.

5
00:00:08,997 --> 00:00:10,214
Your return to the Underworld

6
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:11,795
has been requested.

7
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:12,796

Paolucci thinks he took
the bullet like a hero.

14
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:23,730
I think he was on the take.

16
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:26,299
no one wants to work with me.

You give me what is mine!

18
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:31,771
Oh, God.

19
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,972
Who stole them?

20
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,140
They were yours.

21
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,575
No, don't!

Waters a bit rough, are they?

00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:44,303
so let's try again,

76
00:02:44,304 --> 00:02:45,805
shall we?

77
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:47,473
My wings, please.

78
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,542
Look, man, why would I take your wings?

79
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,277
I don't even know who you are!

80
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,179
I'm Lucifer Morningstar.

81
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:55,147
And you, you small-peckered fool,

82
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:57,550
are Sergei Bok, a known smuggler.

83
00:02:57,618 --> 00:02:58,738
You move just about anything

84
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:00,419
you can get your trashy Euro hands on.

85
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:01,487
Please, man!

86
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:02,655
I don't have 'em!

87
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:03,890
I swear.

88
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:06,455
Okay? I don't know
what I'd do with a pair...

89
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:08,427
Maybe if I hit him a few times?

90
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:10,596
Though I hate to say it,

91
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:12,932
I'm not sure violence is the trick here.

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm beginning to wonder

93
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:16,836
if this human stain is
actually telling the truth.

94
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:18,337
No! He's scum.

95
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:19,939
He'll say anything.

96
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:21,574
Maybe it's not him, it's us.

97
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:22,742
Us?

98
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:25,111
He's the fifth man we've
accosted this week.

99
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:27,079
Perhaps we're... dare I say it...

100
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:29,115
going about this wrong?

101
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:30,383
(sighs)

102
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,286
It may be time to seek
the help of a professional.

103
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:34,720
(sighs)

104
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:36,556
Oh!

105
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:38,558
Maze!

106
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:40,793
(gasps)

107
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:43,963
(coughing)

108
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,034
Hey.

109
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:49,302
I don't know that you
want to be here right now.

110
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:50,503
DETECTIVE: There she is.

111
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:53,139
Yeah. What, do I hate a
"hate me" sign on my face?

112
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,974
If only it were that simple.

113
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,742
It's about Malcolm.

114
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,810
What about him?

115
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,679
They guy's been in a coma for months.

116
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:01,847
His wife decided to pull the plug.

117
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,317
Malcolm's dying today,

118
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:07,253
and you're still
investigating him for corruption.

119
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:08,601
So, what, they hate me even more

120
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:09,989
now that I won't put a halo on his head?

121
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:11,057
Maybe stay away

122
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:12,692
from the precinct tonight.

123
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,727
Cops are staging a living wake here.

124
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:15,928
Anything else?

125
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,202
It would make everyone's life easier

126
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,338
if you would close your investigation.

127
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:26,672
You know, Dan, I
thought we were actually

128
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,374
making progress there for a second,

129
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:31,718
but once again, look
who's on Team Everyone Else.

130
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,185
I'm trying to protect you.

131
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:34,313
From what?

132
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,248
Catching a criminal or hurting your rep?

133
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:38,584
It's not about any of that.

134
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:39,952
It's about Malcolm's family.

135
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,254
If there's an open
investigation calling for his dismissal,

136
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:43,522
it can cost them his benefits,

137
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:44,890
his pension, all of it.

138
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,026
So, what, you want me to just drop it?

139
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:49,795
Just turn my back on
everything I stand for?

140
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:51,097
No.

141
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:52,865
I'm saying if you want to
do something about it,

142
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:53,933
then do it now.

143
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:56,235
You have 24 hours.

144
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:58,571
Or let it go and let his family move on.

145
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:21,397
Is this really what you
do in your spare time?

146
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:23,729
How fascinatingly morose.

147
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:25,431
Do you ever think of taking up knitting?

148
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:27,767
What are you doing here?

149
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:31,270
I'm here because I could
really use your expertise.

150
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:33,339
You're not busy, are you?

151
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:34,974
Actually, shocker, I am busy.

152
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,876
And it's really not a good day

153
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,844
for... your... Luciferness.

154
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:39,979
Hmm?

155
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,280
Here's an idea.

156
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:42,581
- Call next time.
- No, no, no.

157
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,717
Hold on.

158
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:47,687
Now, I'm not one to get into
the feels, usually, but...

159
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,889
you seem genuinely distressed.

160
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:51,724
You okay?

161
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,125
Do you want to... I don't know...

162
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:55,394
chat about it or something?

163
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:57,697
Sex is always on the table.

164
00:05:57,764 --> 00:05:58,597
(scoffs)

165
00:05:58,665 --> 00:05:59,865
You never quit, do you?

166
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:00,666
(laughs) No.

167
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:03,469
I'm simply offering an ear.

168
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,272
Come on.

169
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,973
(sighs)

170
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,477
Remember the Palmetto
case I was telling you about?

171
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:12,945
The case that's been consuming you,

172
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:14,013
causing people to despise you,

173
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:15,448
call you names... I even quarreled

174
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:17,016
upon occasion because of it?

175
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,751
No, doesn't ring a bell.

176
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:19,985
(chuckles)

177
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:21,813
Well, they're pressuring
me to drop the case,

178
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:22,621
assume the party line,

179
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,056
and say the guy died a hero.

180
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:25,324
My spidey sense tells me

181
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:27,793
dropping it's not what you want, is it?

182
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:29,095
I want the truth.

183
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:30,162
Well, then seek it out.

184
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:31,330
You're a police officer.

185
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:32,965
You don't need anyone's permission.

186
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,266
Hmm.

187
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:36,135
That's decent-ish advice.

188
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:38,237
I know. I'm quite good.

189
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:39,605
Anyway, now we've helped you, my turn.

190
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:42,141
See, I'm working a
sort of case of my own.

191
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,476
And it seems that I've...

192
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:45,611
Well, hit a bit of a snag.

193
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,847
A case?

194
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:49,014
(chuckles) Um...

195
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:50,249
What kind of case is it?

196
00:06:50,317 --> 00:06:51,851
Well, the nature of the investigation

197
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:52,918
isn't important.

198
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:54,854
I'm strictly here for
professional advice.

199
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:58,090
What do you do when
your case hits a wall?

200
00:06:58,158 --> 00:06:59,358
Mmm.

201
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:00,960
What do I do when I get stuck?

202
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:02,027
Yes.

203
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:04,063
Well, I grab a pair of fresh eyes...

204
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,565
someone who's not gonna be
afraid to be honest with me,

205
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:09,535
even if it's not what I want to hear.

206
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:10,402
Hello.

207
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,605
That's a brilliant idea.

208
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:13,773
Yeah.

209
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,674
It kinda is.

210
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:17,109
So...

211
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:19,211
maybe if you help me,

212
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,713
I could help you.

213
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,181
(door creaking)

214
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,482
Could...

215
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,151
And Bob's your uncle.

216
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:26,352
Right.

217
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:39,698
What are we doing here, Lucifer?

218
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:42,067
I like to come here from time to time.

219
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:43,803
Dip my toes in the sand,

220
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,337
breathe the ocean air,

221
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:47,339
walk down memory lane.

222
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:48,574
(chuckles)

223
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,577
You see, five years ago,

224
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,078
when Maze and I abandoned Hell,

225
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:55,815
I landed right here on this beach.

226
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:59,251
This is where I flipped dead old Dad

227
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,953
the grandest of birds.

228
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:04,056
And had Maze sever my wings.

229
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:06,425
And why are you telling me this?

230
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:07,893
Honestly, why summon me here at all?

231
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:10,696
Surely it's not just to reminisce.

232
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:12,264
(chuckles)

233
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,301
I've asked you here because
those same wings

234
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,236
have been stolen.

235
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:21,640
And I need your help to get them back.

236
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:32,083
Sync & corrections by <font color="#00ff00">Somnath Yadav</font>
<font color="#ffff00">join me @somnath66/</font>

237
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:35,521
- Your wings are missing?
- (chuckles)

238
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:36,588
Sorry, is there an echo?

239
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:37,790
Isn't that what I just said?

240
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,625
What exactly am I
supposed to do with that news?

241
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:41,226
Use your angelic powers

242
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:43,362
to soar around the city and find them.

243
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,530
I mean, really,

244
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:45,697
what good's an angel

245
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:47,366
if he can't help a brother out?

246
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:48,967
Am I right?

247
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:51,904
Lucy,

248
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:53,411
since your grand departure from Hell,

249
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,941
I've been the one that's
had to patrol the gates,

250
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,576
I've been the one keeping damned souls

251
00:08:57,644 --> 00:09:01,180
from slipping loose... a
job, by the way, that I loathe.

252
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:02,748
- I didn't ask for that.
- But those wings

253
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:04,883
out there in the human world?

254
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:06,351
Lucy, they're too powerful.

255
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,753
A piece of divinity.

256
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:10,022
Humanity can't handle them.

257
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,890
And if they fall into the wrong hands...

258
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,559
Then people might die? Yeah, I get that.

259
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:15,561
Just saw a chap toss
himself off a building

260
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:18,497
after a mere peek at them, so
if you're done telling me things

261
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:20,466
I already know...

262
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:24,736
will you help me or not?

263
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:26,505
You tell me something.

264
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:27,806
If you truly hated the wings,

265
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:29,641
why'd you hold onto them all this time?

266
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,810
(chuckles)

267
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,446
- That is none of your business.
- It's a sentimental move, Lucy.

268
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:36,048
Especially for someone that was trying

269
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:37,382
to leave their life behind.

270
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,817
Please. Here we go.

271
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:41,820
Maybe deep down you realize
you never should've cut them off.

272
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:43,188
And maybe that's why

273
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:45,090
you left yourself an out.

274
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,625
Yeah.

275
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:47,926
So are you done?

276
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,962
Pretty words, but no.

277
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,964
They're my property. I want them back.

278
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:53,398
Simple as that. If I can avoid

279
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:56,435
an earth-shattering
tragedy as well... bonus.

280
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:58,403
You wanted free will.

281
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,141
You wanted accountability.

282
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,076
Well...

283
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:06,979
fix your own damn mess, for once.

284
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:17,489
(chuckles) I've been thinking.

285
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:19,091
Your problem, my problem...

286
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,027
why not be each other's
fresh eyes and all that?

287
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,829
Hey, what do you say, quid pro quo?

288
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,931
Oh, so now you need my help.

289
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,933
Sorry, am I not enunciating today?

290
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,636
Yes, I've come seeking
your very generous aid.

291
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:32,971
First you have to tell me what
it is you're working on.

292
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,072
(chuckles)

293
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,774
I'm not sure you can handle it.

294
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:36,842
Try me.

295
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,810
Okay.

296
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:40,212
Uh, remember that container

297
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,813
that was so inelegantly taken from me?

298
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:43,081
The one I was convinced

299
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,850
- was hiding something?
- Yes, well, it wasn't just

300
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:46,398
nesting dolls that I was looking for.

301
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:49,788
There was something
else, something... personal

302
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,423
that was missing when we got there.

303
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:52,624
I knew it.

304
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,893
Lucifer, what was in there?

305
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,563
My angel wings.

306
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,630
(laughs)

307
00:10:58,665 --> 00:10:59,765
(chuckles) Yeah, go on.

308
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:00,899
Get it all out.

309
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:01,934
(laughing) Okay, seriously,

310
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,368
what was in there?

311
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:07,973
Oh, you are serious?

312
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,709
Oh... okay, sorry.

313
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:12,244
Did someone make them for you?

314
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:15,180
Or are you big into cosplay?

315
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:16,381
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

316
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:17,516
Sorry, I'll admit

317
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:19,318
I don't always get you.

318
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,653
But if this is really that important...

319
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,155
It is.

320
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:25,090
Okay, I will do what I can.

321
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:27,993
I will put out an APB on...

322
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:31,063
angel wings.

323
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,564
Thank you, and in return,

324
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:35,067
I shall donate my
services on Palmetto, all right?

325
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:36,254
Sure, we could use the help.

326
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:38,003
- (door opens)
- "We"?

327
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:40,205
- Hey.
- Ready to go?

328
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,074
Yeah, you weren't around to help,

329
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:43,642
so I recruited someone else.

330
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,710
The more, the merrier.

331
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:45,744
You're helping her?

332
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:47,913
I knew she wouldn't give it up.

333
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:49,081
And I couldn't let her go it alone,

334
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:51,550
so I'm here for the ride.

335
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:52,784
Hmm.

336
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:54,019
Cool.

337
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:55,721
The three of us working together.

338
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:57,356
Yes, cool.

339
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:59,057
What could be better?

340
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:04,096
♪ Bursting inside ♪

341
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:05,897
♪ It's getting harder to hide... ♪

342
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:08,967
So, this is Palmetto Street.

343
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:12,437
I'm sorry, why is he here again?

344
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:15,774
Uh, he helps me see things differently.

345
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:19,411
Yes, I've proved
myself quite useful, Dan.

346
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,513
So, how can we help you?

347
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,148
All right, I want to
reenact the shooting.

348
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:24,616
I want to figure out what I missed.

349
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:25,817
How's that gonna prove anything?

350
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:28,687
- Just humor me, thanks.
- (chuckles)

351
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:30,856
- Lucifer?
- Yes?

352
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:32,424
You will represent the seedy

353
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:33,825
criminal element.

354
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:35,827
Oh, I believe you mean handsome
criminal element.

355
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:37,596
- (Dan scoffs)
- And, Dan,

356
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,698
you will stand for Malcolm.

357
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:40,766
The tough as nails cop,

358
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,933
who wishes I would

359
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,435
leave this stupid case alone.

360
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:44,870
Ah, cute.

361
00:12:44,937 --> 00:12:46,271
And I will play myself.

362
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,907
A chick cannot figure
out what the hell I saw.

363
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,342
So in the months leading
up to the shooting,

364
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,277
we were following a
French drug trafficker

365
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:53,545
Nikolas Aoudi.

366
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:54,813
Ooh, can I have a gun?

367
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,615
I feel like Nikolas would
definitely have a gun.

368
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:57,883
No...

369
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,151
Actually he was more of a hammer guy.

370
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:00,619
Liked to break fingers and arms.

371
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:02,187
- Okay...
- Some legs and teeth.

372
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,389
Right. Can I have a hammer, then?

373
00:13:04,457 --> 00:13:07,125
Somehow Aoudi kept evading the LAPD.

374
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:09,313
I arrested one of his
guys, thought he was gonna flip.

375
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:11,063
Then suddenly he changed his tune.

376
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,265
The only cop who spoke
to him was Malcolm.

377
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,333
So...

378
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:17,069
one night, I tracked him here,

379
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:19,237
sneaking in through the side door.

380
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:22,074
And I hid behind this glass.

381
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:24,176
I could see them.

382
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:26,445
<i>It was Malcolm and
Aoudi and his bodyguard.</i>

383
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:29,047
<i>They, they looked like
they were making a deal.</i>

384
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:31,249
<i>Malcolm was holding cash.</i>

385
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:32,584
Hold on.

386
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,653
(grunts) Ooh, is that enough?

387
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:36,788
CHLOE: A bribe, maybe.

388
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:38,757
I'm not sure.

389
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:41,159
<i>But I leaned forward to
hear what they were saying.</i>

390
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:42,961
<i>- (glass rattles)
- And accidentally,</i>

391
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,029
<i>I made a sound.</i>

392
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:45,097
<i>I-I could feel it.</i>

393
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,932
<i>He saw me, but he didn't react.</i>

394
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,234
<i>He just went back to his conversation.</i>

395
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:50,662
<i>And that's when the shot went off.</i>

396
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:52,137
(gunshots)

397
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,872
<i>It didn't take long before bullets
were flying everywhere.</i>

398
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,241
<i>I braced behind the door,</i>

399
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:58,610
<i>and that's when I ran in.</i>

400
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:00,912
<i>Aoudi and his man were dead.</i>

401
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,782
<i>Malcolm was on the floor, bleeding out.</i>

402
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:08,820
There was nothing you could do.

403
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:15,927
It doesn't make sense.

404
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,028
Excuse me?

405
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:18,530
Aoudi would have no
desire to kill Malcolm.

406
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,299
Trust me, if there's one
thing I know, it's desire.

407
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:24,636
I mean, if Malcolm were indeed corrupt,

408
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,037
he'd be Aoudi's golden goose.

409
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:27,672
It'd be quite dumb to shoot him.

410
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,307
What if someone else was here?

411
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,943
The cops searched the
place up and down, Chloe.

412
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:33,345
There was no one else.

413
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,615
Look, you may not want to believe it,

414
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:38,517
but what if...?

415
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:39,584
I was wrong.

416
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:42,554
(cell phone ringing)

417
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:44,423
Espinoza.

418
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,924
Uh, yeah.

419
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:48,894
Okay, I will let her know.

420
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:50,162
Did you really put out

421
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:53,432
an APB for... angel wings?

422
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:57,002
Maybe.

423
00:14:57,069 --> 00:14:59,571
Well, it looks like they got a hit.

424
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,906
Excellent!

425
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,941
Right, my turn.

426
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:08,326
I still can't believe
it that the wings are...

427
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:09,861
Real? Exquisite? Divine?

428
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,329
It's okay to say it.

429
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:12,897
I was gonna say, "For sale."

430
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:15,500
So, anything else the
FBI can tell us, Agent Pitts?

431
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,327
The wings... along with
a bunch of other crap

432
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:19,270
people think is
real... are being pawned off

433
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:21,005
at a black-market antiquities auction.

434
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:22,306
An auction?

435
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:24,108
Held under the veil of a
charity event at Crimson Hall.

436
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:25,276
Saints' teeth?

437
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:26,577
Holy napkins?

438
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:27,879
Oh, a piece of the cross?

439
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:29,986
They've got my wings in
absurdly fraudulent company.

440
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:33,084
Yeah, unlike the wings, there's
no way those are real.

441
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:34,519
Exactly, it's insulting!

442
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:36,754
Putting my wings on the block
like some chintzy accoutrement.

443
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:38,022
All right.

444
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,490
Well, you can take
comfort knowing the auction's

445
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:41,726
already set to be raided tonight.

446
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,728
So the FBI are gonna snatch my wings?

447
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:45,363
When we get a chance to
pounce on the bad guys, we take it.

448
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:46,931
The FBI is taking lead.

449
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,399
Figured you might
be after the same guys.

450
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,234
And we have jurisdiction.

451
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:52,770
Okay, so how do we get the wings back?

452
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:53,938
After the raid?

453
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:55,373
As long as you can
prove the wings' provenance,

454
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:56,774
you'll get it back in 30 days.

455
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:58,676
- No problem.
- 30 days.

456
00:15:58,744 --> 00:16:00,878
Yes, no problem, no problem at all.

457
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:01,979
Right?

458
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,182
(quietly) Mm-hmm.

459
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:08,720
♪ ♪

460
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,964
(elevator bell dings)

461
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,205
(laughs)

462
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:29,407
Come on out, Amenadiel.

463
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:34,412
So what happened to going it alone,

464
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,947
lying in my own mess and such?

465
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:37,949
Or did you just want a
front row seat to the action?

466
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:39,150
I assure you, Lucifer,

467
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:40,918
I take no pleasure
in following you around.

468
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:43,988
But this is far too
important to let you screw up.

469
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:46,657
Ah, so you just came to help?

470
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,360
I came to ensure the wings
get back where they belong.

471
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:51,062
Which is where exactly?

472
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,463
You mean besides on your back?

473
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:54,011
Oh, surely, my fine-feathered friend,

474
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,466
you don't expect that to happen.

475
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:58,636
They belong in the
Heavens where they were created.

476
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:01,572
If you don't want them,
that's where they'll be.

477
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,342
Fair enough.

478
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:06,010
Considering we're on a clock now,

479
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:07,078
I could use a wingman.

480
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,913
What do you mean?

481
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:10,748
The FBI's raiding the place.

482
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:13,885
So if we don't get the
wings, humanity finds divinity,

483
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:15,987
so on and so forth... you know the rest.

484
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:17,688
Well, we can't let that happen.

485
00:17:17,756 --> 00:17:19,857
Right, so you can join.

486
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,259
Provided, of course, you can keep

487
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:23,394
that angelic ego of yours in check.

488
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:24,695
I don't have an ego.

489
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:26,964
Sure you do, but I'm encouraging
you to get off

490
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:29,233
that high horse and learn a
thing or two about humanity.

491
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:32,336
Though it appears that
you've picked up a fashion sense.

492
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:33,638
So that's, uh... (sighs)

493
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:35,973
I miss the dress.

494
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:39,043
(beeping)

495
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:43,181
Hello.

496
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:44,015
Private party.

497
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:46,818
(stammers) Honey, not vinegar.

498
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:49,620
Yes, excuse me, I understand

499
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:50,955
this event is very exclusive.

500
00:17:51,023 --> 00:17:54,826
But, uh, surely you've got room for just

501
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:56,427
two more?

502
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,832
Unless you got business here, scram.

503
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:08,573
It's funny you
should say that, actually.

504
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,875
Perhaps I do have
something that might interest

505
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:13,945
those keen on religious relics.

506
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:21,586
Right this way, gentlemen.

507
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:23,321
Thank you.

508
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:25,523
Did you catch all that?

509
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,909
CHLOE: (sighs) I can't
believe I agreed to this.

510
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:34,532
I thought you were helping me.

511
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,733
I am helping.

512
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:36,968
We went to Palmetto, right?

513
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:38,336
We went over everything that happened.

514
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:41,038
- And found nothing.
- Exactly.

515
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,975
Now I want to show you
who your case is about.

516
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:45,776
(sighs)

517
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:48,112
This is who's on the
other end of this case.

518
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,780
Not a monster.

519
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:50,982
Not a villain.

520
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:53,818
But a grieving family
trying to say goodbye.

521
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:57,021
(groans) She saw us.

522
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,127
What is she doing here?

523
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:04,262
I'm sorry, Mel.

524
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:06,163
She's not, she's
not looking for a fight.

525
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:07,999
(scoffs) Are you kidding?

526
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,300
A fight?

527
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:11,168
She...

528
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:14,171
You have no right.

529
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,907
What do you want from us?

530
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:17,708
(sighs)

531
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:20,745
I'm-I'm so sorry for your loss.

532
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:23,180
(scoffs)

533
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:25,616
Just go.

534
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:27,818
Please, just...

535
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:31,656
(door closes)

536
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:35,960
Carmen?

537
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:38,129
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

538
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:48,940
Congratulations, Mr. Morningstar.

539
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:52,944
The Catholics and the
Satanists will be clawing for this coin.

540
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:56,147
With any luck, we may even
have a bidding war on our hands.

541
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:57,715
Wouldn't that be fun?

542
00:19:57,783 --> 00:19:59,317
Who would've thought,
eh, the devil's coin,

543
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:02,053
- worthy of so much love?
- Put a bunch of believers in a room

544
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,890
and... pardon the pun... but
sky's the limit. (chuckles)

545
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,158
(chuckles) That's very good.

546
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:08,693
If I didn't know any better, I would say

547
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,562
that you don't
respect your buyers' faith.

548
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,997
Oh, quite the contrary.

549
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:15,466
I respect my customers' faith very much.

550
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:16,867
But I don't have to
share in their beliefs

551
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:18,769
to profit from them. (chuckles)

552
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:21,806
So I take it you're not a believer then?

553
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:25,276
I'm a man that
believes in one simple divinity,

554
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:27,345
the almighty dollar.

555
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:28,946
(laughter)

556
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:33,484
Humans.

557
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:35,353
Am I right? (clears throat)

558
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,621
I have to admit,

559
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:40,958
I love being the bearer of bad news.

560
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:43,094
Oh? Do tell.

561
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:44,595
The coin's not for sale.

562
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:47,531
I simply used it to gain entrée to you.

563
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,600
Then why are you here?

564
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:51,102
Someone stole my wings.

565
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:53,704
About six feet, glow
with the light of God.

566
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:57,608
So if you'd be so kind as to
deliver them, then we can be

567
00:20:57,676 --> 00:20:59,310
on our way without any...

568
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:01,345
unpleasantries.

569
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:02,880
Funny.

570
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:05,716
That's not how this works.

571
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:07,551
- (guns cocking)
- (chuckles)

572
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,987
Oh, you men don't know
who you're dealing with.

573
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:12,790
Those guns don't frighten us.

574
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:14,358
In fact,

575
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:16,660
I dare you to shoot.

576
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:18,195
Brother...

577
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:19,463
Go ahead.

578
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:21,532
See what happens.

579
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:26,931
And there's that angelic
ego I was talking about.

580
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:33,939
I'm sorry, uh... You were saying?

581
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:36,275
Gentlemen, please... (laughs)

582
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:37,743
Don't mind my brother.

583
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,411
He's just a bit... simple.

584
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:42,148
We meant no disrespect, truly.

585
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:43,566
I thought you told me
you wanted your wings back.

586
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:46,452
I do. But this is
hardly the way to go about it.

587
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,853
Give me one good reason

588
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:49,722
not to finish this right now.

589
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,590
LUCIFER: Because you misunderstood me.

590
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,993
I'm more than happy to buy the wings,

591
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,862
like everyone else, with cash.

592
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,664
A whole boatload of money.

593
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:00,432
If you truly worship the dollar,

594
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,768
then I'm your ticket to divinity.

595
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:10,242
Happy bidding.

596
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,577
(sighs)

597
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:13,846
Thank you.

598
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:22,221
♪ Everybody knows
when, ah, tell me again ♪

599
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:25,357

baby, let's pretend ♪

600

601
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:29,295
LUCIFER: It's funny,
isn't it, how all it takes

602
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,430
to unite the faiths
of the world is a bit

603
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:33,299
of illegal consumerism.

604
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:34,433
Mmm.

605
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:35,501
What I'd like to know

606
00:22:35,502 --> 00:22:38,504
is since when is the Prince of Darkness

607
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:41,106
scared of some insufferable human gun?

608
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:43,075
Well, since I, uh...

609
00:22:43,143 --> 00:22:44,376
I bled.

610
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:46,579
- What do you mean, bled?
- Yep.

611
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:49,281
Don't know how it's possible,
but on top of everything else,

612
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:51,750
seems I'm dealing with a
bit of a mortality sitch.

613
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:54,220
Hence: ixnay on the unsgay.

614
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:56,655
What are you grinning about?

615
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:59,792
I'm just realizing the
gravity of what you're saying.

616
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,460
That I'm allergic to lead projectiles?

617
00:23:01,528 --> 00:23:03,162
That even if you don't choose Hell,

618
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:08,901
all I have do is wait for some
pitiful thug to end you

619
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:12,438
and right back to Hell you go.

620
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,009
You hadn't put that one together
yet, had you, Lucy?

621
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:20,279
You just made my millennium.

622
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:22,214
(chuckles)

623
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:24,583
CARMEN: Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

624
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,085
I'm Carmen Grant

625
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:29,555
and I humbly welcome
you to our Evening of Faith.

626
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:32,091
(applause)

627
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:34,026
Tonight we shall behold items

628
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:36,896
that prove the miraculous is real.

629
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:39,064
There is a power we can't see,

630
00:23:39,132 --> 00:23:41,567
but its light burns
bright in the priceless artifacts

631
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:44,937
that have traveled from around the world

632
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:48,140
and, dare I say, Heaven and Hell,

633
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,342
to find their way to you!

634
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,311
(applause)

635
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:57,583
Without further ado,

636
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:01,086
I would like to introduce
you to the first item up for bid...

637
00:24:01,154 --> 00:24:04,356
the Lost Chains of St. Paul!

638
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,559
According to tradition,

639
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:09,828
St. Paul was imprisoned

640
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:11,697
between 61 and 63 AD.

641
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:15,668
While some pieces are on
display at the Papal Basilica...

642
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:17,536
or so they say...

643
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:20,172
these are the missing links.

644
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,574
Paul's wrists were too
thick to fit in those chains.

645
00:24:22,642 --> 00:24:24,944
I know. That man never could
pass on dessert, could he?

646
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:26,411
He should have been the Saint of...

647
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:27,579
Honey cakes?

648
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:29,848
(laughing)

649
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,918
Those are clearly fake!

650
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:34,253
- What?
- Shh!

651
00:24:34,321 --> 00:24:35,354
Shh.

652
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:37,723
Ooh. Tough crowd.

653
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,659
You don't know the half of it.

654
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:42,061
How did I know you'd come here?

655
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:43,963
Because I'm admirably consistent?

656
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,631
How did you even get in here?

657
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:46,765
Oh, I've got news for you, pal.

658
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,513
You're not the only
one with a little mojo.

659
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:50,035
Mmm. Touché.

660
00:24:50,103 --> 00:24:51,370
And you're welcome, by the way.

661
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:52,638
I came here to warn you.

662
00:24:52,706 --> 00:24:54,506
In about five minutes, the
FBI's gonna storm this place,

663
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:55,741
so we have to go now.

664
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:57,376
But we were just getting started.

665
00:24:57,444 --> 00:24:59,411
"We"?

666
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:01,080
Oh, that's right. You
haven't met, have you?

667
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:02,648
Allow me to introduce

668
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:03,916
Amenadiel.

669
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:04,984
My brother.

670
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:06,552
Well, come on,

671
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:07,820
don't look so shocked.

672
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:09,355
Um...

673
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:12,091
I just didn't

674
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:13,993
expect your brother to be...

675
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,595
so... handsome.

676
00:25:16,663 --> 00:25:18,464
AMENADIEL: We're all
full of surprises, it seems.

677
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:21,934
I never expected my brother
to change careers as he did.

678
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:25,137
But I'm definitely beginning to see why.

679
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:28,040
Lucifer, your brother got

680
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,675
all the charm in the family.

681
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:30,943
Okay, that's enough of that.

682
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:32,611
It's unsettling to
see you two get along.

683
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:34,613
CARMEN: Next up.

684
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:37,750
(crowd exclaiming, applauding)

685
00:25:37,817 --> 00:25:40,085
The wings of an angel.

686
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:49,461
(whispers) They're gorgeous.

687
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:53,532
MAN: Freeze! FBI!

688
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,334
- (crowd gasps)
- MAN: What's going on?

689
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:56,568
Everyone, stay where you are!

690
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:57,903
Don't move!

691
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:02,408
Stay where you are.

692
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:04,543
BODYGUARD: Mr. Grant.

693
00:26:04,611 --> 00:26:05,611
Nobody move.

694
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:06,645
Come on.

695
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:08,981
Stop! Freeze!

696
00:26:17,457 --> 00:26:18,991
Where'd he go?

697
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:21,894
A little help.

698
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:24,430
Please.

699
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:28,133
(exhales)

700
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:35,441
Thank you.

701
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:04,303
They're fake.

702
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,463
I telling you, I saw him come in here.

703
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,098
(indistinct radio transmission)

704
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:17,903
(whispers) There was a secret door.

705
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,307
I see you got your wings.

706
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,075
Thought you'd be happier.

707
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,610
These aren't my wings.

708
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,612
Whose wings are they?

709
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,648
Someone with a warped sense of humor.

710
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:30,082
- I don't...
- They're a knockoff,

711
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,450
a sham.

712
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:33,552
I mean, it's good
work, I'll give them that.

713
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,755
Probably would've
fooled just about anyone,

714
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:38,224
save perhaps the actual
owner of the wings.

715
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,693
The actual owner... being you?

716
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:42,094
Yeah, they must've been switched out.

717
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,163
It's no coincidence that my
wings are stolen one day,

718
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:47,800
and then Carmen's selling an
exact replica a week later.

719
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,635
No, this is some serious foul play.

720
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:51,637
I-I'm sorry to hear that, sincerely.

721
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:54,284
But there's something at Palmetto

722
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:55,654
that I need to take care of, so...

723
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:57,778
Are you coming?

724
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,211
Didn't you hear me?

725
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,680
My wings are still out there.

726
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:02,048
I need to find them.

727
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,083
If you want to run off to
Palmetto, be my guest,

728
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:06,385
but no more role-playing for me, thanks.

729
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:08,688
So I came to save your ass,
but just because these wings

730
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:09,855
aren't the ones you wanted,

731
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:11,490
that's it? We're done?

732
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,594
So much for quid pro quo.

733
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,263
Ah.

734
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,499
You sure you don't
want to chase after her?

735
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:24,170
Maybe I can ask Father for
some rain and make it a moment.

736
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,776
All right.

737
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:32,445
So what's our next move?

738
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:35,548
Well, I'm afraid this is where
I leave you, brother.

739
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:36,782
What I'm about to do

740
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,251
is the Devil's work.

741
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:48,961
I thought we were
finally done with all this.

742
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,496
(sighs) I was done.

743
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:52,932
I even started believing I
was crazy like everybody said.

744
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,934
I never said you were crazy.

745
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:56,836
Yeah. It's okay.

746
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,871
I would've thought I was, too.

747
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:00,773
But, you know, I got to thinking.

748
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,875
Lucifer pointed out
that it made no sense

749
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:04,777
for Aoudi to shoot his
inside man, right?

750
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:06,445
Right.

751
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:09,348
But no one else was there.

752
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,518
No one could've shot Malcolm and
fled without me seeing them.

753
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:13,652
- Now you're making my point.
- Because

754
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,455
there was no obvious exit.

755
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:17,556
But maybe,

756
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:19,558
just maybe... hear me out...

757
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:21,360
there was a secret one.

758
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:24,263
Chloe, you are stabbing
hard at something

759
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,232
- that's just not there.
- There's got to be an explanation

760
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:27,933
for what I saw, Dan! There has to be.

761
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:30,136
What do you need me to do?

762
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:31,203
- I don't...
- (creaking)

763
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:36,008
What was that?

764
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:38,477
(creaking)

765
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:11,277
Looks like it leads up to the street.

766
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,315
Hey.

767
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:20,352
What is it?

768
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,021
A 999 key.

769
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:23,956
LAPD-issued.

770
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,959
Malcolm had his on him.

771
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,795
- Wait. Are-are you saying...
- Yes.

772
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,697
Another cop was here.

773
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,365
- I was right.
- Chloe,

774
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:34,667
- this could mean a lot of things...
- It means

775
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,202
a cop knew

776
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:38,838
this secret passageway existed, Dan.

777
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:40,339
And chances are,

778
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:42,308
whoever it was shot Malcolm, so...

779
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,142
Yeah. But why?

780
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,311
That's what I got to figure out.

781
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:47,746
No.

782
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:49,648
That's what we need to figure out.

783
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:05,331
(doorbell rings)

784
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:16,609
It's...

785
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:17,843
you.

786
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:19,578
That's right, me,

787
00:31:19,646 --> 00:31:22,281
Lucifer bloody Morningstar.

788
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:24,483
Do you mind if I come in?

789
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,684
You, Carmen,

790
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:27,632
slightly more difficult
to identify, aren't you?

791
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:30,089
No phone, no bank account,

792
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:32,358
home registered under one
of your many aliases.

793
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:35,227
Seems wings aren't the only
thing you falsify, eh?

794
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:37,295
- I can explain...
- I'm still moved by your words.

795
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:40,232
"I'm a man that
believes in one simple divinity,

796
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,868
- the almighty dollar."
- You don't understand...

797
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:45,604
No, I understand. Perfectly.

798
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,206
A lifelong atheist,

799
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,608
you took one peek at the wings

800
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:52,011
and something changed in you.

801
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,013
The great white light was revealed

802
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,015
and a believer was born,

803
00:31:56,082 --> 00:32:00,419
one who couldn't
part with real divinity!

804
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,327
(exhales)

805
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,931
Oh, no.

806
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,001
Mounting my wings,

807
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:19,338
like some decorative stag head.

808
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:24,643
(sighs)

809
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,579
Shame on you.

810
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:29,582
It wasn't my fault.

811
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:31,584
Someone tipped me off.

812
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:32,818
Excuses, excuses.

813
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:35,120
"It wasn't me, it was
the biker that did it."

814
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:37,089
I thought he was bringing
me a sculpture.

815
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:38,591
Were you disappointed?

816
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:39,818
I didn't know what they were.

817
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:42,194
I never would have done
it if I had any idea

818
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:43,929
what I was actually dealing with.

819
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,432
Please, please.

820
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:49,902
You can't take them away.

821
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:53,205
I can't live without them.

822
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,674
Perhaps you don't understand.

823
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:59,812
(growling) They're mine.

824
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:03,282
Now, before I deal with you,

825
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,486
I have just one
burning question on my mind.

826
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:11,457
Who tipped you off?

827
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:27,940
(chuckles dryly)

828
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,675
I knew you'd come.

829
00:33:29,743 --> 00:33:31,176
Of course I'd come.

830
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:36,415
It's my duty to return the
wings where they belong.

831
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:38,417
Is that all?

832
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:40,628
(chuckles)

833
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:45,724
After everything that
you've been through...

834
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:48,460
bleeding, searching,
reaching to the high heavens for help...

835
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,896
now that you finally have your wings,

836
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:53,932
doesn't part of you
long to assume your form?

837
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:57,836
Get back to where you belong?

838
00:33:57,904 --> 00:33:59,571
(sighs)

839
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:06,111
Not exactly.

840
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:12,384
What are you doing?!

841
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:14,453
Well, ruining your plan, it seems.

842
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:17,389
It was you, brother.

843
00:34:17,457 --> 00:34:20,826
You tipped Carmen off, and
you orchestrated the theft.

844
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,594
Because you left me no choice.

845
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:23,862
(laughs)

846
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,131
Well, clearly you were desperate.

847
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,200
I mean, you were
willing to let a human die

848
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,669
and unleash the wings upon the world

849
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,638
just to remind me who I was.

850
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:35,374
(laughs) To fool me

851
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:37,176
into desiring the wings

852
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:38,911
and the hellish throne they accompany.

853
00:34:38,978 --> 00:34:41,380
Well, do you know what?

854
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:44,783
It almost bloody worked.

855
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:46,452
But destroy them?

856
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:49,388
Why?

857
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,457
Well, you were right.

858
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:54,059
Severing the wings was a half measure.

859
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:56,428
I did leave myself an out.

860
00:34:56,496 --> 00:35:00,365
A rip cord back to the life that
dear old Dad chose for me.

861
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,167
But I don't need it now,

862
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:07,005
because, in case I haven't made
myself abundantly clear,

863
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:10,776
I'm never going back to Hell.

864
00:35:19,152 --> 00:35:20,552
But, uh...

865
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,354
A for effort.

866
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:26,825
I'm sure Dad will give you
a big gold star for trying.

867
00:35:26,893 --> 00:35:28,694
(bellowing)

868
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:36,702
(laughing) That's
right, hit me, brother.

869
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,970
Go on, again.

870
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:39,104
Become like me.

871
00:35:39,172 --> 00:35:40,172
Become wrath.

872
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:41,740
Fall as I did!

873
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,475
(laughs)

874
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:44,677
Come on.

875
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:50,215
Come on.

876
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:51,383
(chuckles)

877
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:57,256
You never were much of
a closer, were you, eh?

878
00:35:57,324 --> 00:36:01,026
Can't stand to get your hands dirty.

879
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:02,094
(chuckles)

880
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:04,396
This is far from over.

881
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:14,473
I'll do whatever it
takes to get you back to hell.

882
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:31,623
He was like a brother to me.

883
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,325
And for the last eight years,

884
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:35,995
he was the best damn partner

885
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:38,364
that I could've asked for.

886
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,767
(sighs)

887
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:48,407
You know, I-I remember
one time that he...

888
00:36:49,943 --> 00:36:52,644
What in the hell...?

889
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,850
What part of "not
welcome" does she not understand?

890
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,918
Easy, Anthony. Easy.

891
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:01,720
You got some nerve, Decker.

892
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,889
(sighs)

893
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:06,525
I'd like to say a few
things about Malcolm.

894
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,263
He was a hero,

895
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:14,533
who got shot doing what
all of us do every day,

896
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:17,469
by putting himself in the line of fire.

897
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:19,338
I can't take back

898
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,673
the things I've said.

899
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:24,410
But I can promise

900
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:26,412
not to let his life...

901
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:28,747
or death... go in vain.

902
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,887
And for any pain that I've caused...

903
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:38,891
his family or otherwise...

904
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:40,492
I'm sorry.

905
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,729
I'm closing the case against him.

906
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,434
To a good cop.

907
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:53,338
To Malcolm.

908
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,810
To Malcolm.

909
00:37:57,877 --> 00:37:59,711
ALL: To Malcolm.

910
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,526
I hope you're right about this.

911
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:16,528
Trust me, if we're gonna
find a dirty cop,

912
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:18,464
it's best they
don't think we're looking.

913
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:21,867
(piano plays Johnny
Cash's version of "Hurt")

914
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:37,216
I cleaned up your mess on the beach.

915
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:39,751
I'm here to stay, Maze.

916
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:41,286
(sighs)

917
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:43,555
And I truly hate to disappoint you,

918
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:47,626
but... well, this is
where I have to be now.

919
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:52,498
And I know, even with
all the sex and drugs...

920
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:54,500
and more sex,

921
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:57,669
this isn't what you bargained for.

922
00:38:57,737 --> 00:39:01,140
And I know you made a vow, but...

923
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:03,408
But nothing.

924
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:06,478
I am with you, Lucifer,

925
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:08,747
from now until the end.

926
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,418
We're a team, right?

927
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,823
Of course.

928
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:27,699
Now... (sighs)

929
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:29,134
you should get some ice.

930
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:31,336
Yeah.

931
00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:36,408
(sighs) Hmm.

00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:41,146

933
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:46,318

934
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:49,188
What happened?

935
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:51,156
Hmm? Oh.

936
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:53,258
(laughing): Sorry. This, yes.

937
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:55,794
Just a little, you
know, squabble with my bro.

938
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:57,696
Nothing serious.

939
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,898
(sighs)

940
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:01,700
I don't...

941
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:05,103
I don't like how we left
it at the auction.

942
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:07,973
Yes. Yes, I...

943
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,942
I agree.

944
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:12,778
You definitely could
have handled things better.

945
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:14,046
(laughs)

946
00:40:14,113 --> 00:40:17,683
And I supposed, you know, I...

947
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,952
- Sorry. What was I saying?
- (laughs)

948
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:23,522
(sighs)

949
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:28,126
Look, I know how
much it sucks being alone.

950
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:30,596
And I can't pretend to understand

951
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:32,998
why the wings meant so much to you.

952
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,300
(sighs)

953
00:40:35,368 --> 00:40:37,369
But if we're really friends, it...

954
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,706
it should be enough
just knowing that they did.

955
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:45,577
The wings are old news now.

956
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:47,579
(chuckles, clears his throat)

957
00:40:47,647 --> 00:40:49,615
Earlier they were all
you could think about.

958
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:52,150
Now you just don't care?

959
00:40:52,218 --> 00:40:54,219
Well, in my search for the wings,

960
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,321
I realized what they actually were.

961
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:58,824
A relic worth exactly

962
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:01,727
what someone was
willing to pay for them.

963
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:04,229
What can I say?

964
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:07,466
I've moved on to
bigger and better things.

965
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:09,167
So, what changed?

966
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:10,936
I don't know.

967
00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:13,805
Huh.

968
00:41:13,873 --> 00:41:15,507
Or won't say.

969
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:16,875
(laughs)

970
00:41:16,943 --> 00:41:19,378
Well, how'd your
Palmetto thing go anyway?

971
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:22,080
Hmm? Did you find the
answer you were looking for?

972
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:23,749
(sighs)

973
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:25,083
I found something.

974
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:27,986
Oh. Well.

975
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:31,123
