00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:01,867
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:03,468
The reason I started
granting favors again

3
00:00:03,508 --> 00:00:05,611
- was because of the Sinnerman.
<i>- Do you think this is</i>

4
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:07,545
<i>the same guy that kidnapped you
and dumped you in the desert?</i>

5
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:08,973
I may need proof that this guy is real.

6
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,051
He is real. And very dangerous.

7
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,629
I quit my job. Today is my first day

8
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:14,176
in the district attorney's office.

9
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:17,379
- Surprise.
- So why is your gift desire?

10
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,749
Desire is the ultimate
expression of free will.

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,491
I help people do whatever
or whomever they want.

12
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:23,405
Hello.

13
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:24,793
<i>I thought you were looking for me.</i>

14
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,019
Come on. Let's talk.

15
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:28,420
In here!

16
00:00:28,454 --> 00:00:30,451
<i>You want to do
your little desire shtick?</i>

17
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:33,140
When I find out
what someone truly desires,

18
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:35,449
I find out their greatest weakness.

19
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,018
Why is this case so important to you?

20
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:38,737
The Sinnerman killed my brother.

21
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:40,480
- I need to make him pay.
- That's him.

22
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:43,393
You're under arrest.

23
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:46,036
Look into my eyes!

24
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:51,622
Now you will never know what I want.

25
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:59,326
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,996
Please, I need help!
He's gonna kill me! Please!

27
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:11,893
Ah-ha!

28
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,348
Nothing screams weekend like
tequila and scantily-clad women.

29
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:17,209
And tequila. Cheers.

30
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,211
- It's Wednesday.
- Mmm.

31
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:21,833
Exactly. The party's just begun.

32
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:23,550
Why are we celebrating again?

33
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,263
Well, isn't it obvious?

34
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:27,821
We apprehended the cad who
arranged for my kidnapping,

35
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,356
gave me wings,

36
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,624
took away my devil face.

37
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,627
Finally, Maze, answers will be mine.

38
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,578
Right.

39
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,098
If you could say that with
less sarcasm, I'd appreciate it.

40
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:40,633
No, no, I'm sure you're right.

41
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:44,503
I'm sure a human jail
will stop a soldier of God.

42
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:46,405
That's actually<i> more</i> sarcasm.

43
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,640
I'm just saying,

44
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:49,793
devil face, wings... big deal.

45
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:51,578
If he wanted to hit you
where it really hurts,

46
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,502
there are other things
he could do to you,

47
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:56,362
- <i>or</i> take away.
- Oh.

48
00:01:56,387 --> 00:01:58,456
I'm talking about your
life in L.A., Lucifer.

49
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:01,154
The club, your job.

50
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,206
- Chloe.
- I know what you're talking about!

51
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:05,915
But I won't allow it.

52
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,368
I can assure you, the only threat

53
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:10,329
the Sinnerman poses from now on
is that ridiculous name.

54
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:11,797
Mmm.

55
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,300
They're bringing him in for
questioning in the morning,

56
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,203
so I'll get what I need
to break him then.

57
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,604
Good luck mojoing a blind guy.

58
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,539
I don't need eyes

59
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:24,021
to find out the Sinnerman's
desire, ergo his weakness.

60
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:26,545
There are other ways
to learn what someone wants.

61
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:28,429
What ways?

62
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,417
Just... ways.

63
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,151
Oh!

64
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,286
Hello.

65
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:36,155
It's so hard.

66
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,719
Yes, always, but why don't
I help you with your stick first?

67
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:44,925
Go on!

68
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:47,261
- Oh, condoms!
- I'm gonna enjoy every condom!

69
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,284
They're the ribbed kind!

70
00:02:56,497 --> 00:02:59,467
- T minus ten, people.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:01,368
The prisoner is in the house.

72
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:04,872
Eye on the prize, no screwups,
and no one talks to him alone.

73
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,211
Man, I just love watching Pierce work.

74
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:13,247
It's like a master class in ass-whoop

75
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:15,937
with a minor in whatevs.

76
00:03:16,516 --> 00:03:18,418
Yeah.

77
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:21,222
I'm just surprised
at how well he's holding up.

78
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:24,445
- Well, it is his job.
- No. I mean, it's just,

79
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:26,578
there's no way I could be that stoic

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,762
if the Sinnerman had killed my brother.

81
00:03:29,553 --> 00:03:31,570
Wait, what?

82
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:37,180
I knew the case was personal,
but his own flesh and blood?

83
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,743
Holy bananas, he must
totally need a hug.

84
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:41,834
Ella, wait.

85
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:43,510
But Pierce needs our support right now.

86
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,705
I didn't know
it wasn't common knowledge.

87
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,906
All right, this isn't even
my secret to share.

88
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:50,459
Right, of course, 'cause he's so private

89
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:54,697
and brooding and... hot.

90
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,925
Not that that is at all relevant.

91
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:59,659
Look, he's on edge.

92
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,762
- Just don't bring it up, okay?
- Okay.

93
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,735
Right. Through this way. Come on.

94
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:09,970
Keep going this way.

95
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,779
Nice to see you all again.

96
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:16,410
- What. Too soon?
- Come on.

97
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:18,345
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,921
He's certainly oozing remorse.

99
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,666
Pierce.

100
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:33,961
We know he kidnapped Lucifer,

101
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:36,283
we have physical evidence
tying him to the hair salon,

102
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:39,072
the kid with broken legs.
I saw him with a gun,

103
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,622
standing over the guy
he shot. Don't worry.

104
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:44,212
At this point, a confession's
just icing on the cake.

105
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:46,257
- It's over.
- Is it?

106
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:48,055
Ah, good.

107
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,613
Just in time for the main event.

108
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:52,682
Right. Why don't you two
make yourselves comfortable,

109
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:55,513
and I'll take first crack
at Helen Killer here.

110
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:58,554
What? I thought he deserved
a new nickname now that he's blind.

111
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:01,077
I mean, you have to admit,
the Sinnerman has become a tad old.

112
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:02,499
Not happening.

113
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,962
Last time you talked to him,
he gouged his own eyes out.

114
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:08,165
Yes, a minor inconvenience,
especially for him.

115
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:09,577
I mean, can you imagine living in L.A.

116
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,435
and not being able to enjoy the sunset?

117
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:13,249
Yeah, there's not much of a view
from prison.

118
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,398
That's not the point.

119
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,451
- No one's talking to him but me.
- What?

120
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,852
You can't seriously be suggesting

121
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,177
that you're the impartial party here.

122
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,856
I mean, he's clearly your Moby Dick,

123
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,478
and we all know
what happened to Captain Ahab.

124
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,101
Felled by savage revenge,

125
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:27,995
dragged to the bottom of the sea?

126
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,927
Gosh, did they teach you nothing
at cop school?

127
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:31,940
I've read<i> Moby Dick</i> six times.

128
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:33,941
Oh, really. What happened on page 83?

129
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:36,844
So, what should I call you?

130
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,517
- Sinner, is it?
- Ah.

131
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,486
Mr. Man?

132
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,951
A census taker once tried to test me.

133
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,096
Excuse me?

134
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:49,119
I ate his liver with some
fava beans and a nice Chianti.

135
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:54,094
Ah. No. I'm-I'm sorry.

136
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:56,096
Always wanted to do that.

137
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,099
I mean...

138
00:05:58,132 --> 00:05:59,968
Do love that film, though.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,703
Interesting time to make jokes
when two people are dead.

140
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:03,904
Mm.

141
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:05,374
Whatever your name is,

142
00:06:05,454 --> 00:06:08,192
this insanity plea...
it's not gonna fly.

143
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:11,745
You may be sick,
but I know you're not crazy.

144
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,266
Nope.

145
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:15,735
There's a definite method
to my non-madness.

146
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:17,523
- Care to elaborate?
- No.

147
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:19,460
No, you'll figure it out.

148
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:20,927
Eventually.

149
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,795
Doesn't matter.

150
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,932
We've got enough to put you
away for a long, long time.

151
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,065
Oh, speaking of,

152
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:27,067
what time is it?

153
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,403
I can't see my watch.

154
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:33,819
- Ella.
- The Sinnerman's phone from evidence.

155
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:35,509
I'd pick up if I were you.

156
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:39,612
Oops.

157
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,415
Too late.

158
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:43,383
Or you better hope it's not.

159
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:49,013
<i>No! Please! Please!
Will you please help me?!</i>

160
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:50,514
What is that?

161
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:53,860
Wild guess: a woman
trapped in a reservoir

162
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,396
that will fill with water,

163
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:56,784
oh,

164
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,699
pretty soon, I'd say.

165
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,568
Another victim? How is that possible?

166
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:03,971
Always keep 'em guessing.

167
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:06,095
Where is she?!
Who else are you working with?

168
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:10,556
Well, I<i> could</i> tell you,
but what fun would that be?

169
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,781
- <i>Please help!</i>
- The only way she'll survive

170
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:15,520
is if I take you to her.

171
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:19,586
Right.

172
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:22,043

00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:38,802
This is her initial 911 call.

178
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:43,630
The Sinnerman was in custody
when this woman was abducted,

179
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:45,786
which means he's working
with someone on the outside,

180
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:47,549
an accomplice.

181
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,087
Right.
Find the accomplice, find the girl.

182
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,305
Ella, what do we know about her?

183
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,738
Uh, yeah. Maggie Cole,
26, lives in Echo Park.

184
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:58,043
Tech tried pinging her cell,
but the battery's gone dead.

185
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,272
What about tracing the call
from the Sinnerman's phone?

186
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:02,857
Blocked and rerouted
through a server in Delhi,

187
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,328
so, like, zilch way
to track her, which is...

188
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,510
Wonderful news!

189
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:08,512
Means we can save the life

190
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,853
of poor, doomed Maggie
the far more expedient way.

191
00:08:10,886 --> 00:08:13,389
We are not letting the Sinnerman
out of here.

192
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:15,325
He clearly desires freedom, which means

193
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:17,293
he's motivated and likely
telling the truth.

194
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,229
Following his lead will be much faster

195
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:21,865
than running down clues,
dodging red herrings

196
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:24,167
and following up on
random tips from every

197
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,502
Tom, Dick and Dullard.

198
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:26,999
Hey, guys.

199
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,554
Uh, unis... they checked out the...

200
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:30,907
parking lot at Maggie's apartment.

201
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,242
No sign of her or her car.

202
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:34,177
Ah. See? I'm telling you.

203
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,766
Obi Wan Can't-See-Me
is Maggie's only hope.

204
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,408
This is an obvious escape plan.

205
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,716
Find another way.

206
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,086
Fine.

207
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,455
Fine. If you insist on doing it
the long way and investigate,

208
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:48,138
we may as well hurry up and
inevitably get back to my idea.

209
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:49,443
Okay.

210
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,528
What is Trixie doing coloring
crime scene photos at a desk

211
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:54,966
when we have a psychotic killer
in custody?

212
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:56,918
Well, she's done wonders with
that mangled corpse, though.

213
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:58,722
Very artistic.

214
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:00,691
Didn't you book Mrs. Baczynski?

215
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:02,842
Look, I meant to, Chloe,
but I totally spaced

216
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,541
on this random day off school.

217
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:05,841
But don't worry.

218
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:08,866
I'm handling it, 'cause I'm Super Dad.

219
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:13,216
Chloe, come look at this.

220
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:15,185
Wait.

221
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:17,261
Zoom in.

222
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:23,359
Got a pretty good idea
where Maggie spends her time.

223
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:25,648
Thanks. Come on.

224
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:31,460
And there
they are on the first course...

225
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:35,204
the bombastic Blazing Banshees!

226
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:39,801
And their decidedly devious
opponents, the Derby Divas!

227
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:43,503
They're all out there fighting,
ladies and gentlemen.

228
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:46,407
So, Derby Divas
versus the Blazing Banshees.

229
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,718
It's derby's most notorious rivalry.

230
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,795
Oh, ladies to go. I'll take two.

231
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,254
- Wow.
- Whoa!

232
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:53,722
Nice sausage.

233
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:55,524
What? So, those<i> aren't</i> ladies?

234
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,293
No. Sausage. It's an offensive maneuver.

235
00:09:58,326 --> 00:10:00,263
When Trixie started roller-skating,

236
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:03,333
I took her to the derby, and it
was love at first sausage.

237
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,511
Ah. Right, well, as much
as I'd love a bite,

238
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:07,036
how about we get back to proving

239
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:09,239
that your method of finding
Maggie isn't as good as mine?

240
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:10,907
Score is now two to two.

241
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:13,469
Hello there.

242
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:15,218
We're looking for some
misleading information

243
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,817
on a missing person... Maggie Cole.

244
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,370
The Slayer is missing?

245
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,948
When's the last time you saw her?

246
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:23,952
Uh, she ditched practice yesterday,

247
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:25,955
and she hasn't returned
my calls since...

248
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:27,523
Since what?

249
00:10:27,556 --> 00:10:29,826
Since she got
into one doozy of a booby brawl

250
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,987
with our blocker, Helena Handbasket.

251
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:34,329
Helena Handbasket. Very clever.

252
00:10:34,363 --> 00:10:37,035
Took both our pivots to break it up.

253
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:40,409
Oh, right. Let me guess. Helena?

254
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:43,682
- And there's Helena Handbasket.
- Y'all didn't hear it from me.

255
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:46,150
Right.

256
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:49,693
- Helena, can we...
- Busy!

257
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:55,693
- ...ask you a few...
- No way!

258
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:00,056
...questions?

259
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:01,324
Eat me!

260
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:02,824
Yes, please.

261
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:06,098
LAPD! Stop skating now!

262
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:16,370
What on... Oh! Sorry! Sorry.

263
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,595
I don't think so.

264
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,806
She's gonna rack up some more points.

265
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:35,442
Whoa!

266
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:36,692
Has to be a foul.

267
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:44,853
The Banshees and the Divas
are fighting it out.

268
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:46,602
One beer, please.

269
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:49,144
- Is this really the time?
- Always.

270
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:59,467
Cheers.

271
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,914
Well, get the cuffs out.

272
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,739
Two more, two more points.

273
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:04,966
The Banshees pull ahead.

274
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:09,309
Well, I've no idea what the Sin Bin is,

275
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:11,398
- but I approve.
- It's the penalty box.

276
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:14,027
- Oh. Right.
- Want to explain why you ran?

277
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:15,851
Because you were chasing me.

278
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,706
See? No harm, no foul.

279
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,376
No, you ran because you
realized we're cops.

280
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,876
This is all Maggie's fault.

281
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,913
Typical, she ratted me out.

282
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:26,614
So, hold on, you're saying
you<i> did</i> abduct Maggie?

283
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,890
Abduct? What? No. I just
roughed her up a bit.

284
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,120
Roughed her up, why?

285
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:34,064
Because she stole my spot
as lead jammer.

286
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,924
- Ah.
- You know, after Faith Kill

287
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,525
had that car accident?

288
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,495
Maggie didn't deserve that position.

289
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:40,628
She can't even snowplow.

290
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,395
Oh, wheels turning,

291
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:45,192
old theory crumbling, and the only way

292
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,503
- to discard this witness...
- Where were you last night, Helena?

293
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:48,670
...a plausible alibi.

294
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:50,439
I was on fresh meat patrol.

295
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:53,117
Ooh, good for you, Helena.

296
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:55,018
No, it means training a new crew.

297
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:56,645
- Oh.
- Shocker...

298
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:59,072
they sucked. I was here all night.

299
00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:00,648
I didn't abduct no one.

300
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,583
What about Maggie's car...
did she park here at the rink?

301
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,953
Nah. Free lot over on 6th.

302
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:07,394
Maggie isn't just a job-hogging bitch,

303
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,657
she's a cheap job-hogging bitch.

304
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,904
Right.

305
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:14,630
Well, come on, Detective, chop-chop.

306
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:17,367
More dead-end clues
aren't gonna find themselves.

307
00:13:27,468 --> 00:13:29,137
Uh, hi, Mrs. Baczynski?

308
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,392
Wow. Um...

309
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:36,235
my-my deepest condolences.

310
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,936
Well, sweetheart, you won't be staying

311
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,122
with Mrs. Baczynski today.

312
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,123
Or ever again.

313
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,162
Great parenting, Dan.

314
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,595
Good to know that I'm not the only

315
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,373
questionable parent these days.

316
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,965
Uh, Charlotte. Hey. Hi. Yeah.

317
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,569
Yeah, not my finest moment.

318
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:54,737
You're pretty.

319
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,658
How do you know Daddy?

320
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,525
She's my, uh,

321
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,428
work colleague.

322
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:03,513
Sometimes, uh, friend. S-Sometimes...

323
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,390
Um...

324
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:08,983
how's the new job at
the, uh, the DA's office?

325
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,619
Dull. What's a girl got to do
to get a nice, grisly murder

326
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:13,413
or a few underage drug mules?

327
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:15,757
I like you. You're funny.

328
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,593
And you're... short.

329
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,283
Hey,

330
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:22,864
what can I get you, sweetie?

331
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:25,300
Mocha whip with a shot of "expresso."

332
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:28,037
Ye... Wh... No. No, not gonna happen.

333
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,046
Mommy lets me.

334
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,615
That statement would never
hold up in court.

335
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:34,718
Decent poker face, though.

336
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:38,177
Bye.

337
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:40,170
Bye.

338
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:44,487
Daddy, I have an idea.

339
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:47,088
If we can find Maggie's car,

340
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:49,190
it may lead us
to the Sinnerman's accomplice.

341
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,860
Or be a shameful waste of the
poor girl's precious time.

342
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:53,929
What about wasting my time?

343
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:56,012
What happened to being on the same page?

344
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:58,053
You know, partners? Being a team?

345
00:14:58,092 --> 00:14:59,869
Detective, I can assure
you this is all about

346
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,704
me making sure you and I remain a team.

347
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,996
You know...

348
00:15:05,741 --> 00:15:06,876
Maggie's car.

349
00:15:09,832 --> 00:15:11,784
- Plates match.
- Right.

350
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:14,159
Lucifer, we have to call forensics
before we taint the evidence.

351
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:15,969
What, and waste more
of poor Maggie's precious time?

352
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:17,456
Lucifer, no.

353
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,361
Oops.

354
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:37,900
<i>Whoever rigged that grenade</i>

355
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:41,007
wanted that car to explode
the instant someone touched it.

356
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:42,952
No trace evidence means we still have

357
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:44,687
no way of tracking Maggie.

358
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:47,135
I can't believe
I'm suggesting this, but...

359
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,459
Okay, fine, perhaps I shouldn't
have touched the car.

360
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,572
...we need to bust out the Sinnerman.

361
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:54,031
Uh... not what I was expecting, but...

362
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:55,967
thank you, Detective, for
finally seeing things my way.

363
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,394
Well, you clearly
feel strongly about this.

364
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:00,038
For better or worse, you are my partner,

365
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,439
so I need to have your back on this.

366
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:03,418
Just one question, though.

367
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:05,451
How do you suggest we
get him out of here?

368
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,146
I actually have a plan.

369
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:11,248
But in order for it to work, you
need to do<i> exactly</i> what I say.

370
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:12,916
No more going off grid,

371
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,663
no more destroying trace evidence,

372
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:16,212
no more Luciferness.

373
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,921
Is that clear?

374
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:19,671
As a chilled vodka martini.

375
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:21,159
Served neat, of course.

376
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:23,060
First we need the keys to holding.

377
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:25,262
What, the same keys
old stiff-as-a-board Pierce

378
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:26,997
has locked away in his office?

379
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:28,825
Guess we'll need a distraction.

380
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,527
About that Pierce thing this morning...

381
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:32,803
I cannot

382
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:35,073
- stop thinking about that poor man.
- Me, too.

383
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:36,941
He's really going through a lot.

384
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:37,838
Maybe a little Ella

385
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:40,479
is exactly what the doctor ordered.

386
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:44,315
Crafty maneuver, Detective.
But do you really think

387
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:46,950
Ms. Lopez will fall
for such a blatant manipulation?

388
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:48,353
Uh...

389
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,835
Oh, my God, I'm so in.

390
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,022
But here's the thing.

391
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:53,824
I don't want it to seem
like I'm blabbing

392
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:55,979
Pierce's personal business
all over the precinct.

393
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,443
Totes understood.

394
00:16:57,698 --> 00:16:59,435
All over it.

395
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:01,432
I did not hear it from you.

396
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:03,935
I'm going to let him...

397
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:06,003
tell me.

398
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,310
Is everything all right, Lopez?

399
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:14,913
We lost Buttons when I was nine.

400
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:16,580
That was our pet Corgi. Buttons, I mean.

401
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:18,249
Sorry for your loss.

402
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:22,119
I mean, once I understood
how Buttons got out,

403
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,626
I was able to talk about it,
and the healing process

404
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:26,858
could really begin, you know?

405
00:17:26,883 --> 00:17:29,887
I'll never, ever forget that day.

406
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,647
How hard can it be to find one tiny key?

407
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:42,540
Or for a tiny lab tech
to trap a hardened

408
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:45,382
six-foot-four lieutenant
against his will?

409
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,997
For the longest time,

410
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:51,524
I just wanted to find
whoever was driving that evil,

411
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:54,352
champagne-colored hatchback
with the custom spoilers.

412
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:55,697
Uh-huh.

413
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,065
But then I realized...

414
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:00,023
it wasn't about the hatchback.

415
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,751
It wasn't. And...

416
00:18:02,845 --> 00:18:04,162
Where could they be?

417
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:19,310
Okay, assuming we do manage
to swipe the keys

418
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,904
to the holding cell,
how do we get him out of here?

419
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:24,115
I mean, our sightless scoundrel
doesn't exactly blend.

420
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:26,967
All you have to do is
go up to that bomb tech

421
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,619
and hand her this.

422
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:32,200
Consider it handled.

423
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:36,664
Seriously? This is what you want?

424
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:40,773
The more important question is:
what do you want in return?

425
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:46,604
Even if my charm
does work on the bomb tech,

426
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:48,546
and who are we kidding,
course it will, we still

427
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:50,941
need someone to sell the big finish.

428
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:53,018
Someone deserving

429
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:55,280
of a very special gift.

430
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,047
Aw.

431
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,348
What's this?

432
00:18:58,381 --> 00:18:59,616
It's too nicely wrapped

433
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:01,430
to be another severed head.

434
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,821
_

435
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:04,421
Seriously?

436
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:10,242
Call the bomb squad!

437
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,932
Everyone evacuate now!

438
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,382
Eat your heart out, George Clooney.

439
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,452
Not literally.

440
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,719
Understood.

441
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:38,188
I cannot believe that actually worked.

442
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:40,025
Well, it almost worked.

443
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:44,488
Did you really think I was gonna
let you bust him out...

444
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:45,964
without me?

445
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:56,074
Oh, put that down, please.

446
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,365
That was given to me
by the ambassador of Sweden.

447
00:19:58,436 --> 00:19:59,467
It's very...

448
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,303
- Ugly?
- Valuable.

449
00:20:02,512 --> 00:20:04,147
There's nothing fun to do here.

450
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:07,536
I can't touch anything
or jump on anything.

451
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:10,192
And you don't have
any toys to play with.

452
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,270
I thought you'd be more exciting.

453
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:14,351
Well, you could alphabetize

454
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:17,027
these case files.

455
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:20,631
You don't have kids, do you?

456
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:22,567
Actually, I do. Two.

457
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:25,511
- They live with their father.
- That makes sense.

458
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:28,106
Um, well, it's for the best

459
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:30,500
since I'm so busy at work,
and if you don't mind,

460
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,510
I'd like to get back to it,
if I'm ever gonna catch a case.

461
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,606
And that makes no sense.

462
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:37,581
Well, if the department sees
that I'm working hard...

463
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:39,384
No, about your kids.

464
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:41,597
My mom and dad work,

465
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:43,521
and they still hang out with me,

466
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:46,629
together and apart.

467
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:49,468
- Good for them.
- Monopoly,

468
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:51,988
roller derby,
climbing the wall at the Y.

469
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:54,532
You could do stuff with your kids, too.

470
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,980
Well, the truth is...

471
00:20:57,435 --> 00:20:59,238
they don't want to see me.

472
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:01,581
You're the mom.

473
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:04,242
You make the rules.

474
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:11,620
Are you and my dad having sex?

475
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:15,186
Uh...

476
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:24,845
It really is true,
how the other senses kick in

477
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:26,564
once one is removed.

478
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:28,433
I can remove a few others if you'd like.

479
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:31,101
Shut up and walk. Both of you.

480
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:34,105
A hundred more yards,
then we have to turn east.

481
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:37,637
So, why did Mr. By the Book
change his mind?

482
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:40,228
- Why are you helping us?
- Because you were right.

483
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,646
It's the best way to find the girl.

484
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:43,848
The Sinnerman desires freedom.

485
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:46,703
He wants to escape.
I'm here to make sure he doesn't.

486
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:48,553
Oh, so you really think this is a trap,

487
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:50,603
that this accomplice is laying in wait?

488
00:21:50,658 --> 00:21:52,802
Why else would he lead us
to the middle of nowhere?

489
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:54,695
Right. Ambush.

490
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,786
Well, I guess we'll
just have to go nut to butt,

491
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,195
have Charlie do the foxtrot,

492
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,730
cover each other's sixes and all that.

493
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:02,067
You know? Hooah!

494
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:04,408
Military terms.
Weren't you a serviceman?

495
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,463
Yeah. We don't talk like that.

496
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:11,885
I can't breathe!

497
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,087
I hear something.

498
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:15,179
Help!

499
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:19,446
Help! Aah!

500
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:22,935
I can't breathe!

501
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,472
Maggie, hang on!

502
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:34,698
Come on.

503
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:38,695
Come on. I got you.

504
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:47,811
Come on.

505
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:52,191
You're safe now, Maggie.

506
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:54,485
You're gonna be okay.

507
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:57,187
Where's Lucifer?

508
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:58,756
Where's the Sinnerman?

509
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:07,531
His accomplice<i> was</i> here. Damn it!

510
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,202
They've got Lucifer, too.

511
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:18,516
Come on. Pick up. Pick up.

512
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:20,039
<i>Hello. This is Lucifer.</i>

513
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:21,297
<i>You know what to do...</i>

514
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,883
<i>preferably in the nude.</i>

515
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:24,593
Damn it.

516
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:29,140
How could I be so stupid?
I knew this was a setup.

517
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,038
No. Breaking the Sinnerman
out was my idea.

518
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:34,234
- This is my fault.
- It's my watch.

519
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:36,318
This is on me.

520
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:37,968
We're already canvassing.

521
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,630
Let's put in an APB for three men.

522
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:42,106
We may not need an APB. We have Maggie.

523
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:46,977
I was leaving the rink,
and he chased me.

524
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,313
I made it to my car, but...

525
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,147
he was too strong.

526
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,689
He grabbed me,

527
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:55,085
threw me in a van,
and then I woke up here.

528
00:23:55,118 --> 00:23:56,453
Did you see his face?

529
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:59,190
He was wearing a mask.

530
00:23:59,222 --> 00:24:01,459
Sounds like it happened fast.

531
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:03,059
How would he have had

532
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:05,319
enough time to rig the car
with explosives?

533
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:06,997
Um...

534
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,929
he must have gone back
and put the grenade in later.

535
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:14,705
We didn't mention... a grenade.

536
00:24:21,437 --> 00:24:23,140
Okay, I...

537
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:25,561
Okay, I made it all up.

538
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:28,085
I wasn't attacked... I...

539
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:29,835
I abducted myself.

540
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:31,592
- Why?
- All I wanted

541
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:33,324
was to be my team's lead jammer.

542
00:24:33,356 --> 00:24:34,780
But I could never compete

543
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:37,828
with that spotlight-stealing
bitch, Faith Kill.

544
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:41,465
So... I went to this guy
who grants people favors.

545
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:42,967
We need a name.

546
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:45,846
He just goes by the Sinnerman.

547
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:48,037
I asked him to get rid

548
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,039
of Faith, and the next thing I know,

549
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,776
she's in a car accident.

550
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:54,157
- I never wanted anyone to die.
- So he took out

551
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:56,980
your competition,
then demanded you repay him

552
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:59,116
by faking your own kidnapping?

553
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:01,770
And the 911 call...

554
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,067
the explosion.

555
00:25:04,582 --> 00:25:07,684
He was going to kill me, too,
if I didn't do it.

556
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:13,830
There was never an accomplice.

557
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:15,257
Then who kidnapped Lucifer?

558
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:17,233
No one. He wanted to be alone with him,

559
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,064
so he kidnapped the Sinnerman.

560
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,115
Oh, good! You're awake.

561
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,820
Just in time for the fun to begin.

562
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:39,677
But, uh... before we start,
one tiny adjustment.

563
00:25:43,632 --> 00:25:45,377
There we go.

564
00:25:45,595 --> 00:25:47,364
Much less creepy.

565
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:51,989
Where...

566
00:25:52,014 --> 00:25:53,069
where am I?

567
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,353
Well, I thought we'd extend
our little field trip.

568
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:59,474
I save my Hills estate for...
only very special occasions.

569
00:25:59,506 --> 00:26:01,607
My very own "sin bin," if you will.

570
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:03,131
Gosh, it's poetic, isn't it?

571
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:06,879
The man who desired freedom
fell into his very own trap.

572
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:08,914
Is that what you want?

573
00:26:09,555 --> 00:26:11,951
- To be my warden?
- Oh, no.

574
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:15,625
No, the only thing I desire is answers.

575
00:26:15,996 --> 00:26:17,118
So...

576
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:20,264
it's time to make a deal with the Devil.

577
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,969
You give me what I want,

578
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:25,764
and I might give you what<i> you</i> want.

579
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:28,053
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

580
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:29,561
Oh, yes...

581
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:31,036
you are.

582
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,771
You had me kidnapped,

583
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:34,497
dumped in the desert,

584
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:36,952
somehow made my feathery
burdens grow back,

585
00:26:36,983 --> 00:26:39,155
and then took away my devil face.

586
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:40,880
Why?

587
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:46,807
You will talk.

588
00:26:47,036 --> 00:26:50,713
And you will give me
what I want: wings off,

589
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:52,224
devil face back!

590
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:55,838
Because no one decides who I am but me!

591
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:57,439
Ooh...

592
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:01,118
I'm sensing this is the part
where the said devil face

593
00:27:01,157 --> 00:27:03,009
would kick in, right?

594
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:06,106
Okay. Okay.

595
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:07,606
I'll tell you what you need to do.

596
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:10,590
But it's not gonna be easy. First...

597
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:12,511
you have to draw a pentagram,

598
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:15,315
sprinkle some powdered eye of newt,

599
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:18,050
and then wait for a full moon.

600
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,019
How's your howl?

601
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,796
Freaking impossible to make it
through that with a straight face.

602
00:27:30,903 --> 00:27:33,532
Tragic error, my sinful thug.

603
00:27:33,566 --> 00:27:35,934
Oh. What are you gonna do?

604
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:38,411
Punish a feeble, blind man?

605
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:41,416
Oh, no, no.<i> I</i> wouldn't dream of it.

606
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:47,947
Oh, right, you can't see.

607
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:50,340
Allow me to paint you a picture.

608
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:53,458
Meet Hell's most brutal torturer.

609
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,863
The pleasure's all mine.

610
00:28:02,746 --> 00:28:04,222
Are we sure he's not celestial?

611
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:06,128
Are you questioning my expertise?

612
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,529
He's definitely human.

613
00:28:07,784 --> 00:28:10,225
- And you tried waterboarding?
- Twice.

614
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,315
- Bamboo under the nails?
- Do I look like an amateur?

615
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:15,051
Nickelback on repeat?

616
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,209
- That's where I started.
- Well, what kind of demon

617
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:19,881
can't procure answers
from one puny human?!

618
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:22,041
You want to give it a try? Be my guest.

619
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,070
Gladly. Hand it over.

620
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:28,037
No. I've pushed that guy to his limit.

621
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:29,606
Anything else might kill him.

622
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:31,177
You and I both know...

623
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:34,099
Angels aren't allowed
to kill humans, yes.

624
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:38,484
Or are they?

625
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:41,950
Lucifer...

626
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:44,020
- don't be an idiot.
- No, no, no, no.

627
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:46,488
This is the answer
to all my problems, Maze.

628
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,327
Killing the Sinnerman
is exactly what I need to do.

629
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,631
We need to find out
where Lucifer took him.

630
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:56,097
Unis checked Lux and the penthouse,

631
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:58,097
but no sign of Lucifer or the Sinnerman.

632
00:28:58,175 --> 00:28:59,801
And, of course, his cell's still off.

633
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,970
- Any hits on the van they took off in?
- Nada.

634
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:03,305
He must have had a car stashed

635
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:05,073
and then ditched the van on the way.

636
00:29:05,107 --> 00:29:07,944
- This may help.
- What is this?

637
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:09,299
High-end real estate?

638
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,713
It's every place Lucifer owns

639
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,697
- in Southern California.
- Part of Espinoza's

640
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:13,960
Lucifer files.

641
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:16,519
Um, why do you have files on Lucifer?

642
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:17,953
Chloe and I were married.

643
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:19,922
So what if I did some due diligence

644
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:21,657
on my wife's new partner? Call it...

645
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:23,008
being protective.

646
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:25,079
Not the word I had in mind. Stalker.

647
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:26,718
But... whatevs.

648
00:29:26,743 --> 00:29:28,397
Lucifer plants a bomb at my desk,

649
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:29,665
and I'm the creepy one?

650
00:29:29,706 --> 00:29:32,075
Um... actually...

651
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:33,863
that was me. Sorry.

652
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,371
The bomb was fake.

653
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,076
Wow. Okay.

654
00:29:37,332 --> 00:29:39,339
Human heads. Explosives.

655
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,661
Can someone send me, I don't know,

656
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,826
a muffin basket next time?
That'd be nice.

657
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,546
There's over a dozen properties here.

658
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:46,949
Oh, and some are, like, an hour away.

659
00:29:46,982 --> 00:29:49,152
- I guess we have to check each one?
- Maybe not.

660
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:51,224
I think I know where they are.

661
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:01,664
I'm a demon.

662
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:04,412
Big fan of death and destruction.

663
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:06,402
But killing a human

664
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:08,637
is Angel No-No's 101.

665
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:11,184
Look at your brother...
total power loss,

666
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,101
and he only got murder adjacent.

667
00:30:13,142 --> 00:30:14,477
Precisely my point.

668
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,134
If I kill a human, then I lose my wings!

669
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:19,425
And, because I've been
such a naughty angel,

670
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,915
I get my devil face back,
and... bonus!...

671
00:30:21,993 --> 00:30:24,529
I rid humanity
of our sightless psychopath.

672
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,263
Three birds, one Sinnerman.

673
00:30:26,288 --> 00:30:29,726
Mm-hmm. In theory, except your
Father is going to be pissed.

674
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,461
You kill a human,

675
00:30:31,493 --> 00:30:33,228
one that He sent to do His bidding...

676
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:34,629
Exactly!

677
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:38,071
Look, you said it yourself, Maze.

678
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:42,038
If I don't stop this now, who
knows what else he'll do, or...

679
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:45,607
...who he might take from me?

680
00:30:53,782 --> 00:30:55,318
Okay.

681
00:31:00,182 --> 00:31:02,025
Wait!

682
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:03,760
Where are you going?

683
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,588
Happy hour at the Chateau.

684
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:08,063
- Text me when you've done the deed.
- What...

685
00:31:08,097 --> 00:31:09,598
Actually...

686
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:12,101
I'll be able to tell
by the plague of locusts.

687
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:20,510
You're sure that they're in the Hills?

688
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:21,710
I mean, pretty sure.

689
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:23,881
He said, "Imagine living in L.A.

690
00:31:23,912 --> 00:31:25,981
and not being able to enjoy the sunset."

691
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:28,242
I mean, just like Lucifer
to bring a blind man

692
00:31:28,283 --> 00:31:30,224
to the place with the best view.

693
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:32,554
And you know him that well?

694
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:34,257
Thought I did.

695
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,526
Just... hope we can get there

696
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,062
before he does something
he can't take back.

697
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:46,169
That is an embarrassment
of riches, really.

698
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:49,830
So many delicious ways to kill a human.

699
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:51,540
Let me see.

700
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:53,675
Starving rats. No.

701
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,178
Too time-consuming.

702
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:56,312
Gunshot?

703
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:57,413
Banal.

704
00:31:57,445 --> 00:31:59,635
Oh, I know... oldie but a goody.

705
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,245
Beheading.

706
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:09,993
Honestly!

707
00:32:10,192 --> 00:32:13,128
Can you at least<i> try</i>
to look threatening?

708
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,399
All right.

709
00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:30,546
Well, slight improvement.

710
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:32,689
And I can't kill you sitting down.

711
00:32:32,714 --> 00:32:35,184
You need to stand up
and face me like a man.

712
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:38,453
Well, come on!

713
00:32:42,223 --> 00:32:43,592
I'm to your left.

714
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:46,374
Your other left...

715
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:49,465
I'm right here!

716
00:32:49,498 --> 00:32:51,253
Hello?! Marco!

717
00:32:51,518 --> 00:32:52,835
I...

718
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:56,806
Well, there's no glory
in wrestling a starving bear.

719
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,579
Perhaps a last meal of some kind
to perk you up.

720
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:02,518
Hello.

721
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,308
Caviar.

722
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,369
You're going to... feed me?

723
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:10,457
Well, just because I'm about
to slaughter a man in cold blood

724
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:12,442
doesn't mean I'm not civilized.

725
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:16,332
No. Just means you're stalling.

726
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:20,191
Don't be preposterous.

727
00:33:20,223 --> 00:33:21,658
I've waited a long time for revenge.

728
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:23,465
I'm simply savoring the moment.

729
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,763
I want you to feel your failure.

730
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,799
The knowledge that,
long after you're gone,

731
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:33,253
I shall continue to live here however

732
00:33:33,424 --> 00:33:36,276
and with whomever I choose.

733
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:37,541
Or...

734
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:41,679
you don't have what it takes
to kill a man.

735
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:43,215
Not many people do.

736
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:46,176
Perhaps you're a coward.

737
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,957
He's here.

738
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:58,694
Evil, smug, homely.

739
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:02,899
Bingo! You win the grand prize
at the Painful Death Raffle.

740
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:05,769
So, unless you want a bonus
round for being a loudmouth,

741
00:34:05,816 --> 00:34:07,311
- I suggest that...
- Me?

742
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,042
You're the one doing all the talking.

743
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:14,577
Actually, you know what,
I'll boil you alive.

744
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:16,500
Yeah. Top most painful way

745
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,007
to die, according to BuzzFeed.

746
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:20,850
Right. I'll need a pot. A big one.

747
00:34:20,883 --> 00:34:22,586
How about drown me with a flood?

748
00:34:22,618 --> 00:34:24,722
Or strike me with lightning?

749
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:27,975
What cheesy metaphor

750
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:29,733
would you prefer?

751
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,295
Apple, tree?

752
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:34,678
A chip off the old block?

753
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:39,613
Like Father,

754
00:34:39,638 --> 00:34:41,305
- like Son?
- Enough!

755
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,857
Pull the string, puppet master.

756
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,412
Damn it. Where are they?

757
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:50,123
Take the upstairs.

758
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:52,816
You're right.

759
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,953
I don't have it in me to kill a human.

760
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:59,256
Uh, no. No, wait.

761
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:02,359
You have to do it.

762
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,761
Hold on.

763
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:05,344
I wondered why you,

764
00:35:05,415 --> 00:35:08,203
the evil genius, hadn't sprung
a more clever trap.

765
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:10,312
It has to be you.

766
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,062
Because I was the trap.

767
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:15,179
You never wanted freedom.

768
00:35:15,773 --> 00:35:18,751
Your true desire was to die.

769
00:35:18,814 --> 00:35:20,548
And for some reason,
you need me to do it.

770
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,919
Yes.

771
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:24,814
Yes. You supposedly believe
in free will.

772
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:26,415
Then honor mine.

773
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,623
- Why do you need me to do it?
- Free will.

774
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:30,521
Why?! Why?!

775
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,432
No.

776
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:37,440
No!

777
00:35:38,662 --> 00:35:40,291
No.

778
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:45,992
He's gone.

779
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:58,159
Pierce, I'm sorry.

780
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,151
I know you didn't want it
to end this way.

781
00:36:01,237 --> 00:36:03,573
It's the only way it could end.

782
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,871
You have clearance...

783
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,819
You wanted to see me?

784
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:23,452
Yes.

785
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:25,991
Something very strange
just happened here.

786
00:36:26,335 --> 00:36:28,628
Um, a "thank you for saving
my life" might be appropriate.

787
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,722
I actually wasn't the one in danger.

788
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:33,050
I figured out that you're the
one who grabbed the Sinnerman.

789
00:36:33,097 --> 00:36:34,811
Clearly, things went south.

790
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:37,258
No. Let me explain what happened.

791
00:36:37,313 --> 00:36:39,882
What happened
was you didn't follow my lead.

792
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,453
And, as usual, you did
whatever the hell you wanted.

793
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:44,790
Detective, I understand
that my interest in getting

794
00:36:44,844 --> 00:36:47,454
our blind barbarian alone
may have been a tad selfish,

795
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,909
but it turns out I was the pawn.

796
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,141
I don't have time for this.

797
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,433
It was the Sinnerman's plan to
be snatched by me all along.

798
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,141
He wanted to die.

799
00:36:57,205 --> 00:36:58,672
Pierce smoothed things over,

800
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:00,122
if that's what you're worried about.

801
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:02,068
The official statement says
that you were grabbed

802
00:37:02,102 --> 00:37:03,266
in an escape attempt.

803
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:05,151
You think I care what Pierce thinks?

804
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,181
No. I don't think you care
what anyone thinks.

805
00:37:07,214 --> 00:37:08,783
That's not true.

806
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,577
I told you, I did this for us.

807
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,053
For us? For the team?

808
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:14,056
I had your back on this, Lucifer,

809
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:15,701
and, for whatever reason,

810
00:37:15,772 --> 00:37:17,792
you still felt the need
to go behind mine.

811
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,066
Daddy!

812
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:36,054
Hey.

813
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:38,079
So, the afternoon went well?

814
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:43,785
Hey, uh, as a thank you
for watching Trixie,

815
00:37:43,817 --> 00:37:45,921
maybe we can go grab
that coffee sometime?

816
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:47,830
Uh, we got coffee this morning.

817
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:49,824
Yeah.

818
00:37:49,857 --> 00:37:52,323
I'm kidding, Dan.

819
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,967
Dinner would be more romantic.

820
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,205
- Dinner it is.
- It's okay by me.

821
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:08,006
- Bye.
- Bye.

822
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,748
You are the best wingman ever.

823
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,065
Yes, it's me again.

824
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:31,777
I don't care what they or you say.

825
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,169
I want to see my kids.

826
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:37,902
I'm their mother.

827
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:44,279
What are you looking for?

828
00:38:44,312 --> 00:38:46,534
Answers.

829
00:38:46,748 --> 00:38:48,620
I mean, there has to be something

830
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,026
in Sinnerman's personal belongings.

831
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,252
I'll be right back.

832
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:55,542
I just want to say,

833
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,025
oh, my God, you killed it.

834
00:38:58,058 --> 00:38:59,362
I mean, killed him.

835
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:01,629
I mean, I obvi wasn't there-there,

836
00:39:01,663 --> 00:39:03,765
but I just read the crime scene report,

837
00:39:03,797 --> 00:39:05,199
and... holy burrito bowl...

838
00:39:05,232 --> 00:39:07,860
with your "take down
the bad dude" heroics and...

839
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:09,729
Lopez, just stop talking!

840
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:17,279
What on earth?

841
00:39:42,236 --> 00:39:44,317
Well, I'm here.

842
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:46,746
This couldn't have waited till morning?

843
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:49,809
Time-sensitive, I'm afraid.

844
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:52,436
Or, in a way, the opposite.

845
00:39:53,882 --> 00:39:56,287
Just tell me what you want.

846
00:39:57,285 --> 00:39:59,514
Right. Well...

847
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:02,200
we're both familiar
with the accomplice theory...

848
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:05,935
that our blind barbarian
had someone working for him.

849
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,614
Yeah.

850
00:40:07,678 --> 00:40:08,833
Right, well, then

851
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:11,967
it occurred to me that,
what if the Sinnerman

852
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,383
was the one working for someone else?

853
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:16,897
What if<i> he</i> was the accomplice?

854
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:20,023
Exhibit A.

855
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,072
Here is Mr. Sinnerman as a child.

856
00:40:24,307 --> 00:40:26,114
With a man

857
00:40:26,147 --> 00:40:28,236
that he seems very close to.

858
00:40:28,432 --> 00:40:30,666
Interesting birthmark.

859
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:32,830
It's a very similar shape
to your military tattoo,

860
00:40:32,893 --> 00:40:34,255
actually, wouldn't you agree?

861
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:36,123
So?

862
00:40:36,156 --> 00:40:37,601
Well, so it stands to reason

863
00:40:37,674 --> 00:40:40,643
that this man would be
very, very old by now.

864
00:40:40,795 --> 00:40:43,198
Or, if he isn't, he'd have to be...

865
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,266
...you know, immortal.

866
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:47,983
An immortal crime boss.

867
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:50,337
- Just like you're the Devil.
- Yes, I know,

868
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,246
it does sound absurd, doesn't it?

869
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,142
So, as such, there's really only

870
00:40:54,174 --> 00:40:57,035
one way to prove my theory.

871
00:40:57,312 --> 00:40:58,949
Where did I...

872
00:40:59,013 --> 00:41:00,949
Ah, there it is.

873
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:04,256
I wonder why I didn't
figure it out sooner.

874
00:42:05,142 --> 00:42:07,345
"The world's first murderer,

875
00:42:07,448 --> 00:42:09,123
"marked by God

876
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:10,951
"and doomed to walk the earth alone

877
00:42:10,984 --> 00:42:12,486
for a tortured eternity."

878
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,983
It's quite the moniker.

879
00:42:14,254 --> 00:42:15,905
Yet, still,

880
00:42:16,051 --> 00:42:19,155
nowhere near as ridiculous
as the Sinnerman.

881
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:24,808
Wouldn't you agree...

882
00:42:25,165 --> 00:42:26,301
Kane?

883
00:42:38,477 --> 00:42:40,414
You may as well pour me one, too.
