1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:06,622
Item 28:
your pet name for me.

2
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:08,991
Time's running out on this.
You need to make a decision.

3
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:11,877
I submitted you
a notarized list.

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,964
I'm sorry, but "Gollum" and
"Flakey" are not acceptable.

5
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:17,700
Well, you don't like
"Princess Corncob""

6
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:21,270
you don't like "Fester"-- you're
just impossible to please.

7
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:22,788
We'll come back to that one.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,507
This brings us
to the final item

9
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:27,009
in our annual State
of the Relationship Summit.

10
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:29,779
Item 29: Valentine's Day.

11
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:32,932
Ah, the worst for last. Hmm.

12
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:36,102
Classic Flakey.

13
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:39,855
Before you get upset, I believe
I've come up with a way for us

14
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:42,224
to celebrate the occasion
that we both can enjoy.

15
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:44,743
People usually start
a meeting with a joke,

16
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,530
but you go ahead--
end with one.

17
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:50,316
I propose we spend a weekend

18
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,351
at a bed-and-breakfast
in Napa Valley.

19
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:55,738
I hate every word
in that sentence.

20
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:59,925
Including "in""
"at," "we" and "a""

21
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,994
Come on, Sheldon. Why not?

22
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,663
For starters,
a bed-and-breakfast forces you

23
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,082
to eat with strangers
at your table.

24
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:08,200
One step ahead of you--

25
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,969
Bernadette and Wolowitz
are going with us.

26
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,053
Oh, very well.

27
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:12,338
What are the
sleeping arrangements?

28
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,174
We've only been dating
for three years.

29
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:19,245
If we were to share a room,
people might talk.

30
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:20,646
I got you your own room.

31
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,317
What if my room has
a claw-foot bathtub?

32
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:25,871
It doesn't. I know it makes you feel like
you're bathing inside a monster.

33
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:28,887
Look, I appreciate the effort,

34
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,223
but I'm still
unclear how this trip

35
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,075
is supposed to be
enjoyable for me.

36
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:36,078
We're going to have
Valentine's Day dinner

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,931
on a fully functioning
vintage train.

38
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,233
Vintage?

39
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,935
Be specific.

40
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,171
An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive

41
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:47,373
leading a train
of meticulously restored

42
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,092
1915 Pullman
first-class coaches.

43
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:52,845
Wow.

44
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,681
I'm feeling the
urge to hug you.

45
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,851
And one... and two...

46
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,936
All right, Gollum,
we're good.

57
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,706
Are you sure you guys don't want
to come with us to Napa?

58
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,124
You could probably
still get a room.

59
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:37,710
No, I think we're just gonna
have a quiet weekend at home.

60
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:39,211
Plus, I'm not sure
it's a great idea

61
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:41,780
to take Penny to where wine
comes from.

62
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:45,551
What? It's a joke.

63
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:47,953
Oh, come on.
We bust on each other.

64
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:50,306
I wear dorky glasses,
you might have a problem--

65
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:52,925
it's all for laughs.

66
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:56,846
That would really piss me off if
I didn't have a buzz going on.

67
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:03,185
Howard, which pocket watch
will you be wearing

68
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:04,854
for dinner on the train?

69
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:12,661
I'm sorry, what?

70
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:14,830
Oh, I'm afraid if we wear
the same pocket watch,

71
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:17,366
it will be embarrassing.

72
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:21,120
I don't own a pocket watch.

73
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:23,322
Oh, my.

74
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:27,209
Well, then my apologies for
bringing up this sore spot.

75
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:32,631
Since you two are gonna be
around for Valentine's,

76
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:33,999
would you mind
watching Cinnamon?

77
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,218
You have Valentine's plans?!

78
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,171
Which came out sounding
way more surprised than I meant.

79
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:41,774
L-Let me try that again.
You have Val...

80
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:43,559
See? I can't do it.

81
00:03:44,844 --> 00:03:47,146
I don't have plans
which is why I booked time

82
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:48,981
on the big telescope that night.

83
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:50,532
Well, an evening
looking at the stars--

84
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,034
that's still
kind of romantic.

85
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:53,485
Except I'll be alone.
I'm trying to put

86
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:56,405
lipstick on a pig here.
Work with me.

87
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,858
We'd be happy to watch Cinnamon.
Yeah.

88
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,710
Thank you. Oh, and I'd like
for at least one of us

89
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:03,862
to see some action, so if
you guys happen to have sex,

90
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:05,915
it's cool if she stays
in the room.

91
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:09,468
Hey, same goes for the two
of you with Amy.

92
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:23,565
What do you think,
Sheldon?

93
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,901
It's magnificent.

94
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:28,604
This is going to be
the best Valentine's Day ever.

95
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:30,105
I'm so glad you like it.

96
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:31,440
I'm prepared to say

97
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:35,494
I love it, as soon as I confirm
there are no hobos aboard.

98
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:39,832
Okay.

99
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:43,285
Raj, I got it.

100
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:44,787
Bye.

101
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:48,457
That was your daddy.

102
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,263
He wanted me to say that he
misses... Why am I doing this?

103
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:56,849
Happy Valentine's Day!

104
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,884
Ooh, flowers <i>and</i> chocolates?

105
00:04:58,886 --> 00:05:02,304
Somebody's trying to get
me out of my panties.

106
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:05,140
Don't be surprised if you find
five chocolates missing

107
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:07,693
and three gross coconut ones
with a bite taken out.

108
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:11,230
It came that way
when I bought it.

109
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:13,065
Got you a little
something, too.

110
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,316
Aw.

111
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:16,285
Jewelry.

112
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,203
Oh, my God.

113
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:19,872
Lakers tickets?!

114
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:24,126
It gets better. Instead of me,
you can take someone

115
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:25,794
who will actually enjoy it.
Aw!

116
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:29,281
You are the best boyfriend ever.

117
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:31,800
Thank you. Seriously,
please don't make me go.

118
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:37,389
Should we take this
little party to the bedroom?

119
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,725
Mm, don't have to-- we have
the whole place to ourselves.

120
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:42,127
Oh, that's true.
In fact, if you want,

121
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:44,213
we can do it right here
on Sheldon's spot.

122
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:50,886
That is the least sexy thing
anyone's ever said to me.

123
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:52,488
To the bedroom!

124
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,655
Yeah!

125
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:02,164
And for the entrée, tonight's
special is a seafood risotto.

126
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,198
Do you have any questions?

127
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,616
Uh, I do.

128
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:08,337
Uh, does this train car have the
original link-and-pin coupler

129
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,873
or the Miller Hook and Platform?

130
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:13,926
I'm sorry, I meant questions
about the food.

131
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:15,761
Oh, of course. Um...

132
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:18,547
he seafood risotto
being served on a train car

133
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:20,265
with the original
link-and-pin coupler

134
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,267
or the Miller Hook and Platform?

135
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:26,055
I-I think we're
gonna need a minute.

136
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:30,476
Fun fact: it's neither.

137
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:32,678
They actually

138
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,980
use the AAR type E coupler.

139
00:06:34,982 --> 00:06:37,682
If you listen carefully when
the locomotive disconnects,

140
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:40,736
you'll hear the characteristic
click-pshht-thunk

141
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:42,955
of the knuckle.

142
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:47,409
Get out of town.

143
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:52,030
Fun fact: I'm gonna
jump off this train.

144
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,369
Hey, Cinnamon,

145
00:06:57,371 --> 00:07:00,038
guess who just did it
human style.

146
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:03,041
Oh, my God!

147
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:05,310
It's a little late,
but I'll take it.

148
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:08,063
No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates.

149
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:09,982
That's really bad for dogs.

150
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:12,234
Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?
We gotta get her

151
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:14,686
to a vet right now.
I don't have a vet.

152
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:17,689
I have a podiatrist,
an optometrist, an allergist,

153
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:21,527
a dermatologist, a urologist.
You'd think I'd have a vet.

154
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:23,078
Okay. There's one not far
from here. Come on. Let's go.

155
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,896
Okay.
Koothrappali was right.

156
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:27,249
We should have
let her watch.

157
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:32,121
Do another one,
do another one!

158
00:07:32,123 --> 00:07:33,438
Okay.

159
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,040
Here's my impression
of the Amtrak

160
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:37,926
Acela barreling
down the Eastern Corridor.

161
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:49,204
It's like there's a train
in your mouth.

162
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,856
Oh, yeah.

163
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,775
I've got one.
Um, the Amtrak Wolverine

164
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,978
coming into Chicago.

165
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,988
I've been on that train.

166
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,373
And I just was again.

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,460
Hey, see if you guys
can guess this one.

168
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:14,246
Bang! Splat! Thud.

169
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:18,417
How many trains
have you been on?

170
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,970
Tons. A box fell on my head
at UPS six years ago.

171
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:25,274
Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

172
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:29,344
Wow. Your life's amazing.

173
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:31,230
Not always.

174
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:34,433
A box fell on my head
at UPS six years ago.

175
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:37,903
Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

176
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:44,409
Why do I even try?

177
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,028
I'm gonna fix
this right now.

178
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,581
Okay. Just make it look
like an accident.

179
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:53,535
Excuse me.
You are

180
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:55,370
at Valentine's dinner
with your girlfriend.

181
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:57,589
Now get back over there
and be with her.

182
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:00,325
You're right.

183
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:02,661
That was
insensitive of me.

184
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:04,763
I have to go back
to my table now.

185
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:06,098
You should join us.

186
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,349
All right.

187
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:10,802
Great.

188
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:13,004
Now there's two of 'em.

189
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,568
How much chocolate
did she eat?

190
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,186
A whole box.
Well, to be fair,

191
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:29,289
you ate a lot of it
before you gave it to me.

192
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,675
So the point is I may
have saved her life.

193
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:35,446
I'm sorry,
is this a joke to you?

194
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:37,397
No.

195
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,583
Maybe to her.

196
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,437
How big
a box of chocolate was it?

197
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:44,955
Uh, something like
this. I don't know.

198
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:47,958
It came free with
a full tank of gas.

199
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,427
Really? Do you know how much
those Lakers tickets were?

200
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,862
Do you know
how much gas is?

201
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:52,713
Hey!

202
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:55,432
Sorry.
Sorry.

203
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:59,085
Oh, my God, Cinnamon,
are you okay?!

204
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:00,354
I can't believe you two!

205
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:02,139
You do whatever it takes
to save her life.

206
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:04,424
If she needs new organs,
I'll buy any dog necessary

207
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:06,426
and scrap them for parts!

208
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:08,762
You're the owner?

209
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:10,614
Owner, father, soul mate,

210
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:13,951
and if anything happens to her,
your worst nightmare!

211
00:10:15,904 --> 00:10:17,921
Well, she's not
throwing up,

212
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:19,206
which is a good sign.

213
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,542
So, I'm gonna take her in back,
put her on fluids

214
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:23,243
and give her something
to absorb the toxins.

215
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:24,828
Okay?
Okay. Okay, thank you.

216
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,763
Oh, if she's scared,
you can sing to her.

217
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:28,782
She likes Katy Perry.

218
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:29,950
Oh, but don't
do "Firework""

219
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:31,785
That gets her all riled up.

220
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:33,403
Got it.

221
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:35,639
Should have been a dentist.

222
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:40,644
Okay, what was
the best four-ten-four

223
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:42,295
U.S. locomotive
ever built?

224
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:44,631
Trick question.
There never was one.

225
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:45,849
Or was there?

226
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:48,068
What?!

227
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:53,090
In 1944, the Pacific Railroad
built number 6131,

228
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:54,942
which rearranged
the drivers and cylinders,

229
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:56,810
solving the problem
of the Q-1,

230
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:58,962
creating a duplex-drive
four-four-six-four.

231
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:00,414
In what world is

232
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,833
a four-four-six-four
a four-ten-four?

233
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:04,585
A world I don't
want to live in!

234
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,472
Seriously, I no longer want
to live in this world.

235
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:11,258
Hold on to your
conductor's hat.

236
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,126
You crank the second
and third axles,

237
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:15,512
creating a pair
of internal connecting rods,

238
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,163
and boom--
four-ten-four.

239
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:19,099
If you think
about it, the Q-2

240
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:21,268
was like the four-ten-four
America never made.

241
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,954
I may never <i>stop</i>
thinking about it.

242
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:26,623
Amy, what are the odds
we run into this guy?

243
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,174
Better than you think.

244
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:32,679
You know, if you ask nicely,

245
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:34,281
they'll let you visit
the engine room.

246
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,117
I never want
this day to end.

247
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:40,170
It's feeling like
it never will.

248
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:41,455
Come on.

249
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,659
Hey, did I tell you
what happened to me at UPS?

250
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:52,482
As if Valentine’s Day wasn't bad
enough, you try to kill my dog?!

251
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:54,718
And with cheap chocolate,
no less?

252
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,220
It wasn't cheap.

253
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:58,222
It was free.

254
00:11:58,224 --> 00:12:00,090
We're really sorry.
It was an accident.

255
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:02,492
Yeah, we weren't even out
of the room that long.

256
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:05,229
Oh, no, come on.
It was a while.

257
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,648
It was a while.

258
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:12,069
Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?

259
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:13,386
She's responding well.

260
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:16,089
We just want to keep her
a little longer for observation.

261
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:18,408
All right. Uh, would-would
it be okay for me to see her?

262
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,776
We're usually
in bed by now,

263
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:22,312
and I want her to
know that I'm here.

264
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:25,415
Yes, we sleep together,
and sometimes we spoon.

265
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:29,836
It's okay.
I sleep with my dog, too.

266
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:32,456
We're not supposed
to let people in back,

267
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,808
but I think
I can make an exception.

268
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,409
Thank you.
Come on.

269
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:39,429
By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
Oh, yeah?

270
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:40,931
And I don't care

271
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:42,933
what that obnoxious
parrot back there says.

272
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:45,102
I crushed it.

273
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:48,021
I think there's something going
on between the two of them.

274
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:50,924
Maybe, but you also think
nine minutes isn't a while,

275
00:12:50,926 --> 00:12:53,694
so what do you know?

276
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:00,684
You okay?

277
00:13:00,686 --> 00:13:03,620
Why? Because my boyfriend's off
playing choo-choo

278
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:05,656
with some weirdo?

279
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:09,926
Well, to be fair,
they're both weirdos.

280
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:13,113
I don't know what made me think
tonight would be any different.

281
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:16,616
Well, just the fact that you got
him up here still says a lot.

282
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:19,553
To be honest, I bet Howie 200
bucks it wasn't gonna happen.

283
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:23,307
I'm going to the Lego store
to get a big-ass R2-D2.

284
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:27,311
See? It's not
just Sheldon.

285
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:30,580
They're all idiots.

286
00:13:30,582 --> 00:13:32,432
She's right.

287
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:33,867
So, your boyfriend's

288
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:35,068
a fixer-upper.

289
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,236
Most of them are.

290
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:37,404
I mean, look at this guy.

291
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:38,605
You think he
came like this?

292
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:41,074
When I met him,
he was a hot, goofy mess.

293
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:44,578
Now, he's been to space.

294
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,863
That's all me.

295
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:50,350
I had a little
to do with it.

296
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:52,002
Oh, sure you did.

297
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:54,821
Who's Mama's
big space man?

298
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,658
I am.

299
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:06,750
They've been in there,
like, half an hour.

300
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:09,853
Yeah, for future reference,
that's a while.

301
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:16,193
How long should we stay?
I don't know.

302
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:17,277
I'm kind of hungry.

303
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,146
I saw a Thai place next door.

304
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:20,864
Oh. Okay.

305
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,699
Oh. Oh. Hey!
How's she doing?

306
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:25,018
How is everything?
Yeah.

307
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,137
She's gonna be okay; they're
gonna let me take her home.

308
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,338
Oh, good.
So I want you

309
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,706
to keep a close eye on her

310
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,857
for the next 24 hours.

311
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:33,443
Here are a few warning signs
to look out for,

312
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:36,065
and if you see any of them,
don't hesitate to call.

313
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:36,676
Oh.

314
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:39,199
Thank you for taking such
good care of my little girl.

315
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:41,351
My pleasure.
Have a nice night.

316
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:43,153
Yes, thank you
for all your help.

317
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:44,304
Yeah. I'm sorry if
you didn't think

318
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:45,538
we were taking
it seriously.

319
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,656
We love animals.

320
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:48,141
Oh, do you guys own any pets?

321
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:49,059
No.

322
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,511
Good.

323
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:59,235
I love you so much.

324
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:01,437
I love you, too.

325
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:12,382
Sorry.
Sorry.

326
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:14,117
You guys missed
a pretty great time.

327
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:18,121
The conductor and I have
the same pocket watch.

328
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:20,707
It was crazy.

329
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:23,909
Dare I say "loco"?

330
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:25,428
Oh, and, Amy, guess what?

331
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,630
The conductor said
as soon as he gets off work,

332
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:29,515
he can come back
to the bed and breakfast

333
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:30,767
and play his banjo for us.

334
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:34,587
Okay. I need to speak to
my boyfriend in private,

335
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,088
like, right now.

336
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,724
There's a car
with a glass roof.

337
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:39,392
Want to go look
at the stars?

338
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:40,760
Oh, that sounds
so romantic.

339
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:43,062
Oh, give it a rest!

340
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:45,281
Let's go.

341
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:50,503
Why are you still here?

342
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:52,088
Excuse me.

343
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,940
I think you're being
a little rude.

344
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:55,158
<i>I'm</i> being rude?

345
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,909
You've been rude to me
this entire evening.

346
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:58,745
How is that possible?

347
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:02,115
I've hardly spoken to you
since we got on the train.

348
00:16:02,117 --> 00:16:05,752
I'm detecting a little friction
between you two,

349
00:16:05,754 --> 00:16:08,171
and I don't want
to be a third rail.

350
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:10,606
Get it?

351
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:12,725
I get it.

352
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:15,311
Leave!

353
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:19,599
What is your problem?

354
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:20,850
It's Valentine's Day.

355
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:22,935
We're supposed
to be having a romantic weekend.

356
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:25,071
Oh, really? Because
I remember you saying

357
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:27,940
that this trip was going to be
something we could both enjoy.

358
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:31,077
Did you mean that, or were you
just trying to trick me?

359
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,329
Fine, it's true.

360
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:35,248
I deserve romance,

361
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,334
and I didn't know
how else to make it happen.

362
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:42,372
Well, if you want romance,
then let's have romance!

363
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:46,175
Oh, look, there's wine. Mmm.

364
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:49,629
Grape juice that burns.

365
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:52,348
Uh, now let's gaze
into each other's eyes, hmm?

366
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,666
You blinked. I win.

367
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:55,518
Sheldon...
Let's see. What's next?

368
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,687
Oh, kissing's romantic.

369
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:17,356
That was nice.

370
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:19,959
Good.

371
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,881
Um...

372
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:28,634
the conductor said if I come
back to the engine room,

373
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:32,171
he'd show me how to bring
the train through a crossing.

374
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:36,175
Okay, have fun.

375
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:39,512
Do you want to come with me?

376
00:17:39,514 --> 00:17:43,349
Really? I do.

377
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:48,905
Hey, guys, wait up!

378
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:00,338
There you go.

379
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,975
All cozy wozy.

380
00:18:03,977 --> 00:18:08,880
Here, let's see what the doctor
says to keep an eye out for.

381
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:13,018
Hmm. "Rajesh, I was dreading
Valentine's Day.

382
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,822
Thank you for spending it
with me. Yvette."

383
00:18:18,608 --> 00:18:21,493
Cinnamon, she-she gave me
her phone number.

384
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:23,445
If I knew it was that easy,

385
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:26,181
I would have considered
poisoning you months ago.

386
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,118
Oh, what should I say?

387
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,704
Oh, I know. I'll point out
her name's Yvette,

388
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:34,289
and that she's a vet.

389
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,590
That's hysterical.

390
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,092
She'll love it.

391
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,963
Hello.
Oh, hey.

392
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:44,716
You're back. How was your trip?
It was wonderful!

393
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:45,684
Great. What did you do?

394
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:47,219
I made a new friend

395
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:49,271
who likes trains
as much as I do,

396
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:51,139
uh, I kissed Amy on the lips,

397
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:52,107
and, uh,

398
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:53,441
the conductor played his banjo
for me.

399
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:54,559
Good night.

400
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:57,045
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

401
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:58,947
I'm gonna need
more details.

402
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:01,533
Oh, well, my new friend's name
was Eric.

403
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:05,287
Um, Amy lips tasted like
the brownie we had for dessert.

404
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:06,454
Oh...

405
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:07,706
the banjo-playing conductor

406
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,040
was missing a finger,

407
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:11,243
but he made up for it
with his can-do attitude.

408
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:13,995
No, hang on.
Hang on.

409
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:16,498
Are all those things
equal to you?

410
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,466
Hmm.

411
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:20,585
It never occurred to me
to pick a favorite.

412
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:23,505
Well, give it a go.

413
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:27,309
I can't answer that without
collecting additional data.

414
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:30,295
Additional data. You dog!

415
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:32,097
I'm not sure how
listening to other

416
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:35,016
nine-fingered banjo players
makes me dog, but all right.
