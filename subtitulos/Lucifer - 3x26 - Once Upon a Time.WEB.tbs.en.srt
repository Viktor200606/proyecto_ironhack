Detective Dildo of the LAPD.

Ah, yes, of course,
going for the easy answer.

that's not the case here.

192
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:52,530
Really?
Absolutely.
And I need to prove it.

193
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,574
And why's that?

194
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:54,749
Because just this morning,

195

was frozen

196

on somebody else

200
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:04,585

I just want to find the truth

202
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,588
so the right person
is punished for their sins,

203
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,895
and since I know your
corrupt little organization

204

Well, let's just say,

213
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,830
I don't think I could
change anything

214
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:34,441

our relationship less...

Her dad died 20 years ago
of a gunshot wound.

220

That loss changed her,

221
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:52,633
inspired her to follow in his footsteps and become a cop.

222
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:55,201
So what was that one
small thing I changed

223

that changed everything?

224
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:00,075

for a fight.

Rex Wilson in his car.

527
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:22,857
Wait a minute,

528
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,032
are you Chloe Decker?

529
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:25,686
She is.
Amazing, isn't it?

530
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:27,731
What the hell is
going on around here?

531
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:28,993
He was about to talk.

532
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:30,865
Well, apologies
for the interruption.

533
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:32,083
But if you'll allow me
to make amends,

534
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:33,607
I've got a few skills
of my own.

535
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,566
Tell me... Rex...

536
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,395
what is it you desire?

537
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:45,401
REX:
Wait, I...

538
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:49,405
want a good story.

539
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:52,843
Wh-What...What are you
talking about?

540
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:57,631
Uh, people, they don't
follow cars anymore.

541
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:59,023
They follow drivers.

542
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:02,070
Drama. Stryder's dad,
he was a NASCAR legend.

543
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:04,420
And your biggest rival,
if I remember correctly.

544
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:06,683
When he died,
so did my merch sales.

545
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:08,250
So, getting Stryder
to replace him,

546
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:09,730
that-that-that got
the rivalry back.

547
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:11,906
Yeah, but how does that
help you? You're out of a job.

548
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:13,298
I started a management firm

549
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:14,865
about a year ago--
Stryder was a client.

550
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:18,129
It was my idea to
get him to replace me.

551
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:21,829
Poor kid. Stryder,
he... he was so happy

552
00:23:21,872 --> 00:23:23,221
when I made him
that offer.

553
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:25,702
Well, yeah, it was an
opportunity of a lifetime.

554
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:27,835
Apparently, he needed the money
to get him out of a jam.

555
00:23:27,878 --> 00:23:30,228
What do you mean, "jam"?

556
00:23:30,272 --> 00:23:32,405
He was having some trouble
with a guy at work.

557
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:39,281
Uh, uh, excuse me.

558
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:40,500
What the hell
was that back there?

559
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:42,197
I've already apologized
for interrupting

560
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,938
your monologue,
Ms. Decker.

561
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:46,244
No, how the hell did you
get Rex to spill like that?

562
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:49,117
Ah, well, I have the ability
to draw out people's desires.

563
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,248
Well, what are you,
psychic or something?

564
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:52,903
No, no, I can't read
people's minds.

565
00:23:52,947 --> 00:23:54,818
I'm not a Jedi.
[chuckles]

566
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:56,472
People just like
to tell me things.

567
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:59,388
Okay, well, we should stop
stepping on each other's toes,

568
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:01,521
because we both clearly
want the same thing.

569
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:03,958
Oh, that's very forward
of you, Ms. Decker.

570
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:05,699
Yes, I will have sex with you.

571
00:24:05,742 --> 00:24:07,527
We should probably solve
this murder first...No, no.

572
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,093
I mean that we should
work together.

573
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,444
[laughing]:
No.

574
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:13,271
I mean, you've proven
a very impressive adversary,

575
00:24:13,315 --> 00:24:15,491
but I'm not really
a "work together" kind of Devil.

576
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:18,276
So...
Well, too bad.

577
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,583
Because I know who Stryder was
fighting with at work.

578
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,064
Very well...

579
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:27,460
Lead the way, Ms. Decker.
[chuckles]

580
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,508
So, the second marriage
is going well?

581
00:24:32,552 --> 00:24:34,423
Oh, totally.

582
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:36,207
Uh, e-even though
I've made mistakes,

583
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:39,254
the second time around
just feels better. You know?

584
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:40,255
Mm, yes.

585
00:24:40,298 --> 00:24:42,300
It can be hard
to trust again.

586
00:24:42,344 --> 00:24:43,911
This time I just know
she loves me for me.

587
00:24:43,954 --> 00:24:45,913
I have no doubt...

588
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:47,567
that you'll stay with us.

589
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:52,746
More with box office sensation
Nathan Fury when we come back.

590
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:55,444
And cut.[set bell rings]

591
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:59,927
Wow, Linda, every day I am
in awe watching you work.

592
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,234
Oh... [chuckles]
Thank you, Stacy.

593
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:04,801
Uh, when we come
back from break,

594
00:25:04,845 --> 00:25:07,108
ask him how he feels about
his new wife cheating on him.

595
00:25:07,151 --> 00:25:10,503
Can you just give us one second,
please? Thank you.

596
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:11,721
Wait, what?

597
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:13,636
Our investigator
caught her on tape

598
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,900
kissing her costar
at the Farmer's Market.

599
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:17,945
Juicy, right?

600
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:19,947
No. My God,
that's terrible.

601
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,775
That's going to
devastate Nathan.

602
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:23,298
And make great TV.

603
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:27,607
As his therapist,
I can't in good conscience

604
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,869
incite a breakdown.

605
00:25:28,912 --> 00:25:30,174
That's not why I do this.

606
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:32,481
And that is why America
loves you, Linda.

607
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:34,309
But you know what else
America loves?

608
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:35,266
Tears.

609
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,964
But Stacy, you can't...

610
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:38,182
Ratings are down.

611
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:41,055
We need a boost like this.

612
00:25:41,098 --> 00:25:42,535
What's more important
to you?

613
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:53,981
WOMAN:
Set.

614
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:56,505
Aah! [grunts]

615
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:58,507
That's who was arguing
with your stuntman?

616
00:25:58,551 --> 00:26:00,378
Lara Croft wannabe?
WOMAN:
What the hell, Rogers?

617
00:26:00,422 --> 00:26:02,337
Erika Dunlap.
My costar.

618
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,034
I told you that move
wouldn't work.

619
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:05,427
Why don't you ever
listen to me?

620
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,429
Well, she seems to be fighting
with a lot of people.

621
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:09,997
Well, her beef with Stryder
was a lot bigger.

622
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,215
LUCIFER:
Oh?

623
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:12,695
ROGERS: Chloe, what
are you doing here?

624
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,088
You on the schedule today?

625
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:15,655
Hey, Ben. I just forgot
some things in my trailer.

626
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:17,657
But what's going on
with Erika lately?

627
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,572
I mean, she was giving
Stryder grief, too,

628
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:20,747
the last time I saw her.

629
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,313
Everyone deals with
death differently.

630
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:24,098
In Erika's case, she
deals by taking it out

631
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:26,013
on my entire stunt team.Lovely.

632
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:27,884
Nothing we can't handle.

633
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:29,582
Sorry.
Yeah.

634
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:33,237
All right, when you're finished
having a catch-up...

635
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:35,283
What?What was the bigger beef?

636
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:39,156
Uh, well, Erika got
hurt during a stunt

637
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,549
and she was looking forward

638
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:42,856
to a hefty settlement, but
her eyewitness, Stryder,

639
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,509
refused to testify on her behalf

640
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:47,687
and it-it didn't go over well
with Erika.

641
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,559
Oh, so you think she killed him
out of revenge?

642
00:26:50,603 --> 00:26:52,300
Or knowing that without
an eyewitness,

643
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:54,041
she'd have a better chance
at winning the case.

644
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:55,608
And reap the windfall.

645
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:57,653
Right. You know,
I'd go talk to Erika,

646
00:26:57,697 --> 00:27:00,482
but she and I don't
exactly see eye-to-eye.

647
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,704
I've seen what you
can do to people.

648
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:07,663
Erika's trailer
is right there.

649
00:27:07,707 --> 00:27:11,580
Why don't you go
and, you know,

650
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:13,060
do your thing?

651
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:14,757
Ah.

652
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:21,068
I mean...Monkey?

653
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:23,897
Dad. Hi. What-what
are you doing here?

654
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,855
Well, I've been hearing
some crazy stories.

655
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:29,642
You didn't sneak into
a NASCAR race, right?

656
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:32,732
And you definitely didn't
impersonate a cop?

657
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:34,647
Okay, Dad, it's not what
you're thinking.

658
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,257
Good, 'cause if
you're still working

659
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,433
with that mentally ill nightclub
owner, w-what's-his-name.

660
00:27:38,476 --> 00:27:40,478
ERIKA [ecstatic]:
Lucifer!

661
00:27:40,522 --> 00:27:42,002
Lucifer!
LUCIFER:
That's right,

662
00:27:42,045 --> 00:27:44,744
say my name. Say my name.[Erika moaning in pleasure]

663
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:51,228
CHARLOTTE:
Lucifer?

664
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:54,579
Is anyone here?

665
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:11,771
Lucifer?

666
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:21,258
[sighs]

667
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:26,829
Jackpot.

668
00:28:51,503 --> 00:28:54,636
Um, I work for Lucifer.

669
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,638
He sent me here to
get the cash for...

670
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:58,205
I don't care
about the money.

671
00:28:58,249 --> 00:28:59,598
You don't?

672
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:02,732
I care about why you want it.

673
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:07,693
Tell me the truth
and it's yours.

674
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:11,392
Lucifer needs it

675
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:13,133
to finish the
Vegas deal.

676
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:14,308
[sighs]

677
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,268
Because I deserve it.

678
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:26,233
What would you do with it?

679
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:29,671
Whatever I damn well want.

680
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:33,675
I'll take that
as a promise.

681
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:39,464
Go.

682
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:43,424
Embrace your deepest,
darkest desire.

683
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:48,560
Let those sinful little embers
burn into a flame.

684
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:52,607
Why?

685
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:56,220
We'll meet again...
eventually.

686
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:59,440
Somewhere hotter.

687
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:01,791
And the more you sin,

688
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:04,315
the more fun it'll be for me.

689
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:07,927
Think of this as foreplay.

690
00:30:12,192 --> 00:30:13,803
However...

691
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:19,330
if I ever see you and that
boy toy in Los Angeles again,

692
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:22,463
I will gut that pretty
belly of yours.

693
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:27,468
Everyone knows you don't
steal from the Devil.

694
00:30:32,212 --> 00:30:33,735
JOHN:
Do you have any idea

695
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,782
what a difficult situation
you've put me in?

696
00:30:36,826 --> 00:30:38,088
Dad, I had to do something.

697
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:40,090
Okay? Stryder wasn't killed
in a bar fight.

698
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:42,614
And we are on to something.
I can feel it.

699
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:45,008
"We"?
LUCIFER:

Well, your plan worked wonders.

well and truly pumped.

for information.

What happened to doing
your hypno-eye thing?

706
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:02,068

Oh.

707
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:03,765

That's what you meant.
Yes.

708
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:05,463
Oh, no, we went at it
like little bunnies.

709
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:07,291
Next time you should be
more specific.

710
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,771
There will be no "next time."

711
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:12,035
I raised you better
than this, Chloe.

714
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:17,997
Right. Well,
from what I've seen,

715
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,913
what you've raised is
an intelligent, capable

716
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:23,524
and frustratingly
stubborn woman.

00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:25,048
Don't talk to me
about my daughter.

718
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,919

thought he'd be proud of me.

Well, disappointing fathers is
a rite of passage, Ms. Decker.

Take it from someone
who's made a living out of it.

No, no, he's right.

726

He's right. I'm not a cop.

727
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,025
I'm an actress.

728
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:50,160
I mean... who really thought
that I could solve a murder?

729
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:51,639
Well, I did.

730
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:53,685
And I still do.

731
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:56,949
There's no evidence,
not of anything.

732
00:31:56,993 --> 00:31:58,255
That's not necessarily true,

733
00:31:58,298 --> 00:31:59,778
'cause I just learned that
that Erika woman

734
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:01,084
can put her ankles
around my neck.

735
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,913
Okay, that's really
not helping right now.

736
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,784
Thank you.

737
00:32:05,827 --> 00:32:07,438
Wait, if she was
really injured,

738
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:08,613
she wouldn't be
able to do that.

739
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:10,963
Precisely.
She was faking her injury.

740
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:13,444
[laughs] And she was very
generous with information

741
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:14,749

with the ol...

742
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:16,012
Okay, I don't want to know.

743
00:32:16,055 --> 00:32:18,928
Okay. Well, she said
that she needed money

744
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:22,105
and that Stryder refused
to lie on her behalf.

745
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,758
But then he said he was coming
into a windfall

746
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:25,195
and could help her out.

747
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:26,805
Apparently he and a partner
were planning on stealing

748
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:28,589
something very valuable
from set.

749
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:30,504
So maybe Stryder was
backing out of this heist

750
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:31,766
to have a shot at NASCAR.

751
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,072
Well, his partner
wouldn't take kindly

752
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:35,031
to being left high and dry, now,
would he?

753
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:36,423
No. He wouldn't.

754
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:39,818
So, does that mean
you're still in, Detective?

755
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:43,082
How do we figure out who Stryder
was working with on set?

756
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:47,217
Perhaps the murder weapon
will help narrow it down.

00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:32,648
underestimated you.

903
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:34,345
Then how come any time

904
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:36,565
I've ever shown
any interest in your job,

905
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:40,177
you-you either change the
subject, or you push me away?

smarter than me,

you're more headstrong
than your mother

908
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:47,315

wanted to become a cop?

none of those things
scare me as much

916
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:04,723
as thinking of you
in those situations.

917
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:08,205
It was never about whether
you could handle it.
