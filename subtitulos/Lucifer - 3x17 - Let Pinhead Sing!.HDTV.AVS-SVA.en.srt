1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,307
- Previously on Lucifer...
- I'm going to remove

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,804
Pierce's immortal curse

3
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:05,195
so he can finally die.

4
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:06,741
I shall fly down to Hell,

5
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:09,754
pluck your brother's soul and
drop it into a vacant body.

6
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:12,046
This would make you innocent.

7
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:14,004
- Amenadiel's nice.
- If he were nice,

8
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,818
he wouldn't be sneaking around
behind my back with my friend.

9
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,546
When will you understand that
we were trying to protect you?!

10
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:21,781
I don't believe you.

11
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:23,898
I know this is scary,
but we need to start

12
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:25,531
- in your Hell.
- There are

13
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:28,223
so many things that Father
can still take away from you.

14
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:29,238
There is a bomb.

15
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:30,698
If they move, the whole thing blows.

16
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,226
I just wanted to say thank you again.

17
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,242
- Couldn't have done it without you.
- Without me,

18
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:36,404
you wouldn't have been in
danger in the first place.

19
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,740
If the detective had died,
it would have been my fault.

20
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:39,665
I know I promised

21
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:41,209
to help you end your curse,

22
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:43,911
but we need to dissolve
our unholy alliance.

23
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:46,367
The risk is too great.

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,970
I'll put it on.

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,445

00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:55,149
Oh, Jill.

43
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:56,451
Jill?

44
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:58,119
Help me!

45
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:59,821
Someone help!

46
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:02,390
Somebody help!

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,935
I've decided to take
myself out of the spotlight.

48
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:16,093
My Father's spotlight, to be exact.

49
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:19,907
So, no more killing Pierce
to get back at your dad?

50
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,015
Correct.

51
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:23,293
I mean, that whole "mark of
Kane" thing was so dreary,

52
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:24,734
so nihilistic.

53
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,015
There are far better
ways to spend my time.

54
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,282
- Oh?
- Yes.

55
00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:31,362
Well, I could brew
my own artisanal beer.

56
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:34,332
Take a nude painting class.

57
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,679
Buy that pet shark I've always wanted.

58
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:39,527
Maybe you're taking a step
back because of the bomb scare

59
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:43,085
that threatened both you... and Chloe.

60
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:44,288
Don't be ridiculous.

61
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,366
We're in the line of
fire every day, Doctor.

62
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:47,568
I mean, it's all part of being heroes

63
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,661
- for the people.
- Don't get me wrong.

64
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:52,607
If the bomb was God targeting
Chloe for your defiance,

65
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:55,443
then maybe it's good
that you're quitting.

66
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,614
Well, quitting is a strong word.

67
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:58,679
I'm just saying,

68
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:00,748
sometimes we push
boundaries we shouldn't

69
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,715
and cause rifts with
people we care about.

70
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,819
It's only fair

71
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:07,388
we take our share of
responsibility in a conflict,

72
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,887
even if the other is...
somewhat irrational,

73
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,429
demonic, even.

74
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:15,863
Indeed. Nothing wrong

75
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:17,465
with dousing the flames of contention.

76
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,367
- Exactly.
- Right.

77
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,669
- Maybe even apologize.
- Well, let's not go crazy.

78
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:26,874
But perhaps I can stop poking
the bear that is my Father.

79
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:29,210
Get off his radar for a bit, you know?

80
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:30,578
Mellow out.

81
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:39,954
♪ I close my eyes ♪

82
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:42,390
♪ Only for a moment ♪

83
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:44,992
♪ And the moment's gone... ♪

84
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,895
What do you want, Lopez?

85
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:51,098
You know, I just noticed
that you may be a little blue.

86
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,034
So...

87
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:54,882
Ta-da!

88
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,184
To cheer you up.

89
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,106
No, it's not new kicks. It's better.

90
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,641
It's... a compliment box.

91
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,810
I went around the
precinct and asked everyone

92
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:05,046
to write a positive
little note about you.

93
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:06,314
- Why?
- So...

94
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:08,184
that whenever you're feeling down,

95
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:11,051
you can just pull one out,
and it'll perk you right up.

96
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:16,090
Like, maybe now would be a good time.

97
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:19,660
"Pierce has nice arms."

98
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:22,630
Well, agreed. You sure do.

99
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:25,333
"The lieutenant has really great arms."

100
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:27,969
Right again. Two arms, two compliments.

101
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:32,106
"Pierce...

102
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:33,474
is...

103
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:36,773
wicked smart, so funny,

104
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,981
generous and amazing."

105
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:42,218
Now that is a compliment.

106
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:44,118
It says I have really
nice arms, doesn't it?

107
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,072
Nah, nah, 'cause
that'd be really awkward

108
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:49,676
and weird, you and me here
talking about a third arm.

109
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:53,723
And, um, I need to go
check on a lab thingy.

110
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,281
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

111
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:57,298
I've been trying so
hard to cheer up Pierce,

112
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,401
but this is some next level bro-wallow.

113
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,403
You got to get in
there and do something.

114
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:04,839
Yeah. I don't know.

115
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:07,175
- What? Why not?
- Well, it's just...

116
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:09,960
Pierce isn't really a fan of me.

117
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,067
Well, then this is your
chance to change that.

118
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,149
I mean, Dan, if anyone
knows what it feels like

119
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:16,918
to be in the crapper, it's you.

120
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,276
- Thank you.
- No.

121
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,121
What I mean is you can relate, okay?

122
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:22,529
But when you're down, you always,

123
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:25,426
always pull yourself back up.

124
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:29,030
You are positive dude numero uno.

125
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:33,134
Okay. I guess I could try.

126
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:34,569
Good luck.

127
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:36,103
You got this.

128
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:37,371
Hmm.

129
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,185
♪ All we are is
dust in the wind... ♪

130
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:48,337
Okay, I'm a little confused here.

131
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,751
One of the backup dancers
was dressed as Axara?

132
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:52,253
- Yeah. I don't really understand it, either.
- Yeah.

133
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,621
- It normally doesn't happen like that.
- I think

134
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:56,568
- she was looking to get...
- Okay, but you're the manager, correct?

135
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:57,692
Rohan Donahue, yeah.

136
00:05:57,694 --> 00:05:58,759
So, here's the deal.

137
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,338
Axara and a backup dancer, Jill,

138
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,373
decided to switch positions last minute.

139
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,637
Maybe she felt the
act was getting boring.

140
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,535
You'll have to ask Axara for details.

141
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:09,698
We got her back to the
hotel as fast as possible.

142
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:11,677
So was this the first
time she had switched?

143
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,314
Yeah, she didn't say anything
to anyone on the crew.

144
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:16,356
Except for Jill, of course.

145
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:19,504
And no one knew, that means
Axara was the intended target.

146
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:21,007
Let's not jump to any conclusions

147
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:22,508
until we've explored all the angles.

148
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,417
We don't know if anyone was a target.

149
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,501
Maybe it was an accident.

150
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:26,575
It wasn't.

151
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:30,024
This is a piece of big-time
professional firework.

152
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:31,392
From far away: "Ooh!"

153
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:32,727
From up close: "Ah!"

154
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:33,828
Fireworks weren't even

155
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,029
part of Axara's show.

156
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,664
Let alone pointed
right at the spotlight.

157
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,057
Does this mean we're cancelling
the Asia and the Europe tours?

158
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:42,303
Let's not panic until we know
exactly what happened here.

159
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:43,904
Jill's dead, Rohan.

160
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,539
And it was supposed to be Axara.

161
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:49,259
Yes, which means the shadowy
assassin would likely try again.

162
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:50,945
And again,

163
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:53,114
until the butchery is done.

164
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:54,382
Statistically speaking.

165
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:55,287
- He's right.
- Okay.

166
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,751
As long as Axara's in the spotlight,

167
00:06:56,753 --> 00:06:58,185
she has a target on her back.

168
00:06:58,187 --> 00:06:59,453
Yes.

169
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:01,756
The spotlight is dangerous.

170
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:03,291
Who am I kidding?

171
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:04,325
I'm not mellow.

172
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:05,593
I'll never be able to take myself out

173
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:07,497
of my dad's spotlight, but...

174
00:07:09,332 --> 00:07:12,233
I can take the detective out of mine.

175
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:13,978
And focus on other people.

176
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:15,503
What? What are you talking about?

177
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:17,330
Nothing.

178
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,900
You'll thank me later.

180
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:29,908
So you're Axara's bodyguard, are you?

181
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:31,541
Now, I've always had an interest

182
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:33,711
in the personal
protection business, Rob.

183
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:35,713
- Bob.
- Bob, right.

184
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:36,914
Is that short for "Robert"?

185
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,064
No.

186
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:39,333
Fascinating.

187
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:41,240
Oh, it's lovely getting
to know you like this.

188
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,588
Your hopes, your dreams. Hmm?

189
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,596
Been working out as well.

190
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,857
Are you coming?

191
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,946
Uh, no, I'm not really interested in you

192
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,862
and what you're doing. I
think I'm just gonna stay here

193
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:53,531
and chat to my new friend, Rob.

194
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:54,765
- Bob.
- Bob.

195
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:55,931
Right. Bob.

196
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,335
Big fan of old Bobby here.

197
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,036
In fact, if someone were wondering about

198
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,240
my list of favorite people,
Bob might just be at the top.

199
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:04,575
Really?

200
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:05,810
Oh, most definitely.

201
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:09,947
We should go upstairs.

202
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:15,620
Thank you, Bobby.

203
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:18,456
I thought rock stars
only got the best weed.

204
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,689
It's sage.

205
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:23,394
After what happened to
Jill, I'm smudging my space,

206
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:25,062
and my heart.

207
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:26,263
And my lungs.

208
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:27,912
It actually changes
the ionic composition

209
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:28,933
of the air and reduces

210
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:31,168
the body's stress
response to tragic events.

211
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,370
Oh, such compassion

212
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:33,482
from one so young.

213
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:34,907
Please, tell me more.

214
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,108
Can you think of anyone who
may have wanted to hurt you?

215
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,110
You should check Axara's social media.

216
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:41,012
So many obsessed crazies.

217
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:42,113
Love you, Cece.

218
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:43,948
And she makes a mean turmeric smoothie.

219
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,357
Wait, speaking of mean,

220
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,620
there was one guy who
did kind of threaten me.

221
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:51,222
I mean, I didn't take
it seriously at the time

222
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:53,024
because he's a bit of a diva, but...

223
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:54,728
- Patrick.
- Patrick.

224
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:56,527
And who might Patrick be?

225
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:58,229
My ex-backup singer.

226
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,131
Really toxic individual.

227
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:03,100
Rohan fired him last week, and
like I said, he's a drama queen.

228
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:04,402
But he said something

229
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:05,431
like, uh,

230
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:08,472
"I hope Axara dies a
horrible, painful death."

231
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:09,674
Yes.

232
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:11,959
Mm, mm.

233
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:14,211
Suppose it might be worth a glance.

234
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,294
Maze, it's-it's me.

235
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:31,529
Linda.

236
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:36,100
Come on, Maze, I...

237
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:41,439
I brought you a gift to,
you know, bury the hatchet.

238
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:45,443
I don't want to lose you, Maze.

239
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:48,312
And so,

240
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,715
I lost Amenadiel.

241
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:54,017
No man is worth what we have.

242
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:58,517
Please, just hear me out.

243
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,290
Oh, excuse us, I think we're
in the wrong interrogation room.

244
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:21,979
You're looking for Patrick Manning?

245
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,547
Yes.

246
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,649
- That's me, honey.
- Wow.

247
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:28,053
I see someone stole
some of Axara's spotlight

248
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:30,275
and fishnets as severance pay.

249
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:31,555
Why am I here?

250
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:33,279
I'll ask the questions, Patty.

251
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,423
Oh, I always knew Cher was a feisty one.

252
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,927
I'm Donovan McCann, Patrick's lawyer.

253
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,264
So, why is he here?

254
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:41,465
We believe that Patrick made

255
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,667
an attempt on Axara's life last night.

256
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:45,540
Killed a backup dancer by mistake.

257
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:47,004
- Say what?
- We know that you still

258
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:48,706
had the backstage security pass,

259
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,974
which means access and motive.

260
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:51,782
Yes, cold-blooded retaliation

261
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,644
- for your recent firing.
- Firing?

262
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:54,626
That's bananas.

263
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,147
So you're saying you didn't try

264
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:57,564
and take Axara out with a bang?

265
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:58,451
Course not.

266
00:10:58,454 --> 00:10:59,617
Do I hate her?

267
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:00,618
Yes.

268
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,453
It was a bitch to work for that bitch...

269
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:04,488
The long hours, never getting credit...

270
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,190
But she did not fire me.

271
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:07,000
I quit.

272
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:08,659
That's not the story
her people are telling.

273
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:10,961
I bet. Those sycophants
will say anything

274
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,296
to protect her fragile ego.

275
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,657
Well, Patrick. Patty.

276
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,268
If you didn't want Axara dead, tell me:

277
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,884
what did you desire?

278
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:23,640
Uh... to be Axara.

279
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:25,309
But my version.

280
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,111
A better version.

281
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:30,214
Which is why I could
never want her dead.

282
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:34,919
How could I compete with
her if she was kaput?

283
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,235
Yes.

284
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,353
Where were you last night?

285
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:43,789
On stage.

286
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,618
Performing my act at
the Hideaway in WeHo.

287
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:49,522
After which, she was mobbed
by fans in the parking lot.

288
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:50,900
Tuesday's the new Friday

289
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:52,570
now that Patty's doing Axara.

290
00:11:52,572 --> 00:11:54,298
- Mm-hmm.
- Ask around.

291
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:56,149
Aw, so sweet.

292
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:58,052
Donovan was right about last night.

293
00:11:58,055 --> 00:11:59,976
It was cray-cray at the Hideaway.

294
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:04,181
Everyone wants a piece of Axara 2.0.

295
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,350
You wouldn't believe
the obsessive wannabes.

296
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:09,286
- Sad.
- It's sad.

297
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:11,650
Axara has more followers than the Pope.

298
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:14,692
"You are my life, I would
do anything to meet you.

299
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:16,227
Literally anything."

300
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:19,330
Gosh, I can't think of
anyone I care about that much.

301
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:23,200
Except for Miss Lopez.

302
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,210
World's Greatest

303
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:26,270
Forensic Scientist?

304
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:28,172
Oh, my gosh.

305
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:30,207
That is so sweet.

306
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,783
Wait. Did I miss my birthday?

307
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:34,787
Well, every day's a celebration
when you're around, darling.

308
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,490
Mwah!

309
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,016
Anyway.

310
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,087
When obsessed people don't
have their love reciprocated,

311
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:44,518
sometimes they snap.

312
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:46,088
Well, I've gone through them all,

313
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:48,391
and on a scale of #ILoveYouAxara

314
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,361
to #IWantToLivelnYourSpleen,

315
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:51,947
there's, like, a zillion suspects.

316
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,893
A zillion and one if you count me.

317
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:56,018
You weren't even aware
of her until this case.

318
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,335
Okay, name your favorite song.

319
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:00,252
Well, um, there's so many.

320
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:02,655
Anyway, we're not just
looking for a crazy fan,

321
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,158
we need someone who
had an all-access pass.

322
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,960
Well, Axara's assistant let me check out

323
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:09,164
- all of her social media accounts.
- Mm-hmm.

324
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,681
And apparently, she held
an online contest last week.

325
00:13:11,684 --> 00:13:15,744
Winner won a VIP pass to
the Hollywood Bowl show.

326
00:13:15,747 --> 00:13:19,069
Meet our winner: Benny Parker.

327
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:21,892
And these are some of his tweets.

328
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:24,397
"I can't wait for our love to be real."

329
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,405
"I wil make you feel the same way."

330
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:30,108
"You and I will be together forever."

331
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:31,335
That's subtle.

332
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:32,688
Sounds like Prince Charming

333
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,257
needs some attention from the LAPD.

334
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,026
Right.

335
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:39,243
Thank you, Miss Lopez.

336
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,844
I mean...

337
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,564
Oh, no, poor Pauline.

338
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:48,783
Pauline?

339
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,521
My friend who works the
intake desk at the precinct.

340
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:53,057
I'm helping her through a bad breakup.

341
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:55,659
We've grown quite close since yesterday.

342
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,228
Mm-hmm. Right.

343
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,797
I know what you're doing.

344
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:04,667
Our bomb scare made you realize
just how dangerous this job is.

345
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,650
And that you and I
could lose each other.

346
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:07,768
At any time.

347
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:09,669
So you're focusing on other people,

348
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:11,171
you're keeping your distance

349
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:12,876
as a way of protecting yourself.

350
00:14:12,878 --> 00:14:14,178
And you know what, Lucifer?

351
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,312
That's cool.

352
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,414
If you need to "reverse-Oprah" me

353
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,916
just to feel less afraid,

354
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:21,218
then by all means, knock yourself out.

355
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,994
What? I am not afraid.

356
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,123
Just realized I've been
a tad myopic lately.

357
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,791
- Why not spread the love?
- Hmm.

358
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:29,693
I mean, everyone
deserves a little Lucifer.

359
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:30,928
How generous of you.

360
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,929
Thank you very much.

361
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:34,465
After me.

362
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,138
Benny Parker, LAPD.

363
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,973
Seems I'm not the only one ignoring you.

364
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:45,843
Perhaps you're just not
that interesting, Detective.

365
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:48,361
Benny?

366
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,645
Benny.

367
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:07,531
Well, talk about a dead end.

368
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:13,602
"Axara's art celebrates life.
I tarnished it with death.

369
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:15,594
I have no right to stay in her world.

370
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:17,473
I lived for Axara.

371
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:20,810
Now I die for her.

372
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:23,413
Benny."

373
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:24,747
Wow.

374
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:27,083
I hope that no one
ever loves me that much.

375
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:29,352
So, did the M.E. confirm
that it's suicide?

376
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:30,887
Still running the autopsy report,

377
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,455
but the bottle of sleeping pills

378
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:34,066
found in his hand, half empty.

379
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:37,467
Right and factor in Benny's VIP
pass which means he had access.

380
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,602
Yeah, it means that Benny

381
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,229
had tons of time and opportunity

382
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,133
to plant the firework that killed Jill.

383
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:45,034
A textbook post-murder
guilt-driven suicide.

384
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:46,936
A little too textbook if you ask me.

385
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:48,905
Oh, look what just arrived.

386
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,074
Who wants a T-shirt? Here you go.

387
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,586
- And, oh, one for you.
- Nice.

388
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:55,478
One for you.

389
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,581
Definitely for you.

390
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,870
What you can't fix,
decorate, am I right?

391
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:02,038
Ah!

392
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:03,886
Miss Lopez.

393
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:05,922
Aw.

394
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,323
What is all this?

395
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:08,491
Axara swag.

396
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:10,026
Thank you gifts for solving the case.

397
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:11,494
Apparently, she'd have come in person,

398
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:12,895
but she's busy rehearsing

399
00:16:12,897 --> 00:16:14,472
for her rescheduled show at the Bowl.

400
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,461
Well, technically, the case isn't closed

401
00:16:16,464 --> 00:16:18,801
- till we get the final autopsy report.
- Exactly.

402
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:21,404
And until then, it's LAPD jurisdiction.

403
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:22,488
Which means no shows.

404
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:24,273
Well, I'm afraid you'll
have to take it up

405
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,908
with the police commissioner
'cause apparently,

406
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,532
he and Axara are poker
buddies. It's all be sorted.

407
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:30,513
Oh, hello.

408
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,715
An Axara bobblehead.

409
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:35,017
♪ I'm not gonna die no more. ♪

410
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:38,221
Who's deserving of this little, uh...

411
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,824
Ah! My good friend,

412
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,994
Mr. Janitor.

413
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:46,863
That should cheer you up.

414
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:49,065
I think you'll be very proud.

415
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,918
I forced myself to
speak to a coworker who

416
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:53,836
has terrible breath.

417
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,471
It was probably only for a few minutes,

418
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,940
but it seemed like a decade.

419
00:16:57,942 --> 00:17:02,378
Hello, I'm trying to
compliment my... you.

420
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:06,749
Clearly, something is on your mind.

421
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:08,584
Come on, I'm all ears.

422
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:11,087
I am so sorry.

423
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,761
Um, but you're paying
me to listen, so...

424
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:16,907
Well, yes. But the whole
reason that I'm here

425
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,962
is to learn to be less self-centered.

426
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:21,761
Okay, um...

427
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:25,001
Okay, fine.

428
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:29,469
Um, I'm, I'm just having
a wee bit of a conflict

429
00:17:29,472 --> 00:17:31,874
with a, with a friend of mine.

430
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:35,378
Conflict? My specialty.

431
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,746
Mediating... conflict, I mean.

432
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:40,482
Let me help you.

433
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:42,118
Uh, that's very nice.

434
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,719
It's a very nice offer, but...

435
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:47,056
I know. And it feels so strange. It's...

436
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:49,091
I feel so good, it's like I'm floating.

437
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:51,321
Although that might...

438
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:54,163
might be the three
gimlets I had at lunch.

439
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,011
So, yes?

440
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:59,314
Uh...

441
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:01,503
Oh, my God. Chloe.

442
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:03,227
Okay, so you know how you thought

443
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,041
Axara's superfan's "suicide"

444
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,609
was a little too neatly wrapped up?

445
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:09,445
- Mm-hmm.
- You just won the super

446
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:11,080
totally right hunch
of the millennia award.

447
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:13,282
- So Benny's not our guy?
- No.

448
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:16,619
Benny died the day before
that firework exploded.

449
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:19,255
So Benny is not our killer.

450
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:20,972
He's our first murder victim.

451
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,269
So Benny's suicide was staged
before the attack at the Bowl.

452
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:26,862
Yeah. A frame job to cover
up the real killer's tracks

453
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:28,816
which means major pre-meditation.

454
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,299
And that Axara's still
in serious danger.

455
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:32,368
The killer's still out there.

456
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,336
Exactly.

457
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:35,454
This month's winner is...

458
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:38,641
Pauline.

459
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:40,676
And I think we can
all agree that Pauline

460
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:43,104
deserves her place in the spotlight

461
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:44,540
far more than others.

462
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:45,982
So if you'd all like to

463
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:49,118
raise a glass, if you
have one, to Pauline.

464
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,889
Lucifer knows she's a temp, right?

465
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:56,926
- Yeah, just tell him to meet me in the car.
- Yeah.

466
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,606
I don't know exactly
what you're going through,

467
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,719
but I've been there.

468
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:06,605
That very stool, actually.

469
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:08,437
Have you, Espinoza?

470
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,628
You know, talking about it might help.

471
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:12,375
You know, really opening up to someone.

472
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:14,377
I mean, that's what...
that's what I did.

473
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:17,046
And now everything's coming up Dan.

474
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:19,515
No, seriously, man, I'm happy.

475
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:21,584
You know, I'm-I'm ready to start dating.

476
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:23,306
Hell, you and I are even friends.

477
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,323
Friendlier.

478
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:32,929
I guess I could try.

479
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:34,931
Lay it on me.

480
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,766
I'm here for you, bro.

481
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:40,403
It's just life, you know?

482
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:45,074
It's like this eternal wasteland
of meaningless existence,

483
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:48,611
a dark void staring down at you

484
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:53,082
like a beaten dog scrounging
on the side of the road,

485
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:57,887
just waiting to get mowed down
by the next tsunami of crap.

486
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,329
Wow.

487
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,230
Hmm.

488
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:13,102
Maybe we all are just dust in the wind.

489
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:22,345
I am not cancelling my show.

490
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,422
Well, it turns out
that your troubled fan

491
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:26,549
was framed for Jill's murder.

492
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:28,136
So, with the killer still out there,

493
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,752
I can't let you perform tomorrow night.

494
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:32,388
Detective, if I hid under a rock
every time there was an issue,

495
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,856
I'd still be doing bar mitzvahs.

496
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,958
Also, you'd be under a
rock. Most unpleasant.

497
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,118
Okay.

498
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:39,328
Detective.

499
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,731
Now, I say we let Pinhead sing.

500
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,729
I mean, after all, some people

501
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:44,499
are just destined to
be in the spotlight.

502
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:46,380
Others not. Like you, for example.

503
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:47,415
So not helping.

504
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:49,071
You know, maybe you
should wait in the car.

505
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,840
You know what? Maybe you should both go.

506
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:52,274
I assure you, I'm fine.

507
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,512
Detective, what are you doing?!

508
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:57,580
This is...

509
00:20:57,582 --> 00:20:59,314
no time for heroics.

510
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:02,681
Not that I care.

511
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,730
Building searched. All clear.

512
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,589
You poor, poor dear.

513
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:11,125
Can I get you something? Some tea?

514
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:13,127
More face needles, perhaps?

515
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:15,525
Uh, I'm fine, your partner's
actually the one with the medic.

516
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:16,997
Who?

517
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,499
Oh, her.

518
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:20,167
No, that's, uh, that's just a scratch.

519
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:21,168
No, it's you

520
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,669
that I'm focused on.

521
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:24,734
Okay, great. Thank you.

522
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:27,204
Okay, so I have your
security team in place.

523
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:28,773
For tomorrow's show, right?

524
00:21:28,775 --> 00:21:29,907
Smart to beef things up.

525
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:31,172
Yeah, I don't think you understand.

526
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:32,207
There's no show.

527
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,411
While you're in danger, you're under

528
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:35,947
24-hour LAPD protection, led by me.

529
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:38,182
- That's ridiculous.
- Agreed.

530
00:21:38,184 --> 00:21:39,589
She's a terrible choice.

531
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:40,718
I'll do it.

532
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,866
Look what we found in the laundry chute.

533
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,676
I'm gonna head back to the
homestead to expedite ballistics.

534
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:47,305
- You want to come?
- Excellent plan.

535
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:48,575
Why don't you go with Miss Lopez,

536
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:51,228
and I will keep you safe,

537
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,678
you little gem.

538
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:54,699
So you're gonna be my bodyguard?

539
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:56,772
Are you even a real cop?

540
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,169
Consultant, actually.
But I can assure you

541
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:01,072
that my penthouse has
top-notch security.

542
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:04,342
And every other amenity
you could possibly desire.

543
00:22:04,344 --> 00:22:05,676
Hmm.

544
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:07,311
We'll see.

545
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:09,747
Come on, girls.

546
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:13,730
What a treasure.

547
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,186
Okay,

548
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:18,066
the only reason I'm agreeing
to this is hiding Axara

549
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:20,591
at your penthouse is
an unpredictable choice.

550
00:22:20,593 --> 00:22:23,160
But, listen, if there's
even the slightest hint

551
00:22:23,162 --> 00:22:25,262
that she is unsafe,

552
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:27,064
your duties are revoked.

553
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,466
Right.

554
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:29,300
What?

555
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:31,402
Just, you said "duties."

556
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:43,914

00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:06,404

00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:09,704

575
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:15,346

- Bob.

00:23:15,348 --> 00:23:16,930

Mm...

580
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,621
Maybe you can make yourself useful.

581
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,289
Unless that's just a prop.

582
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,894
Prop? Please.

583
00:23:30,897 --> 00:23:33,460

00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:36,364

But none as bright as you, of course.

00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:40,435
Whatever.

587
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:41,862

00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:06,327
whose perfect pitch

allows you to hear what others...

00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:09,264
cannot.

00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:12,867
I need a break anyway.

00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,269
Is this my smoothie stuff?

606
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:16,537
Yes. Yes, but, uh, please,

607
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:21,109
allow me to shower you
with my culinary expertise.

608
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,911
Right.

609
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:24,746
W-Wait, are... No, no, no.

610
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:26,080
Aren't you gonna wash them first?

611
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:28,383
And rinse off all the
nutrients? Don't be silly.

612
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,685
Uh... Hold on.

613
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:32,854
Wh-Where's my fresh turmeric?

614
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:35,256
You can't make it without
the right ingredients.

615
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:36,424
I couldn't agree more.

616
00:24:36,426 --> 00:24:38,726
Just-just stop. Just let me do it.

617
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,167
- Please, forget it.
- I will...

618
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,230
You don't even know what you're doing.

619
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,399
Do this, Miss Axara!

620
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,535
You've got to be kidding me.

621
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:49,537
Everyone loves Axara.

622
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,739
What kind of psycho
would want to gun her down

623
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,107
in cold blood like that?

624
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:54,175
It's you.

625
00:24:54,177 --> 00:24:55,843
- What?
- The gun

626
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:57,512
that we found at the Roosevelt,

627
00:24:57,514 --> 00:24:59,981
turns out that it's registered to you.

628
00:24:59,983 --> 00:25:01,549
Oh, this is insane.

629
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,818
I mean, that looks like my gun.

630
00:25:03,821 --> 00:25:05,821
I keep it in the tour
bus for protection.

631
00:25:05,824 --> 00:25:08,038
- But someone must've stolen it.
- We also uncovered

632
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,959
the insurance policy that
you took out on Axara.

633
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:13,094
Apparently, if anything happens to her,

634
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,362
you get a huge chunk of change.

635
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:15,978
Is that also insane?

636
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,365
First of all,

637
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,867
I would die if anything
happened to that girl.

638
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:23,805
Secondly, all managers have
insurance policies like that.

639
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:24,806
But, trust me,

640
00:25:24,808 --> 00:25:26,040
the payout is nothing compared

641
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:28,242
to managing an entire career.

642
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:30,712
Why would I kill the goose for one egg?

643
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:32,313
I don't know. Maybe the goose

644
00:25:32,315 --> 00:25:34,315
is a pain in the ass.

645
00:25:34,317 --> 00:25:35,750
Okay.

646
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:39,754
Unless you've got something
else to say, I'm leaving.

647
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:41,422
I do have something else to say.

648
00:25:41,424 --> 00:25:43,124
You're under arrest for the murder

649
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:45,264
of Jill Murray, Benny Parker,

650
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:47,502
and the attempted murder of Axara.

651
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:48,629
No!

652
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:49,797
Wait.

653
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:55,269
We will start by stating our grievances.

654
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:56,604
Who would like to go first?

655
00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:57,839
She lied and betrayed me.

656
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:58,866
Next.

657
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:01,309
Brave start, Mazikeen.

658
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:03,374
And you, Doctor?

659
00:26:03,377 --> 00:26:05,546
Well, no grievances.

660
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:07,582
Um, Maze is right.

661
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:09,450
I hid the truth, which was

662
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:10,885
a betrayal of our friendship.

663
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:13,806
And if I could take
it all back, I would.

664
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:14,952
But I can't.

665
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:19,060
So, all I can do is say...

666
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:20,728
I'm sorry.

667
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,998
And I miss you, Maze.

668
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,936
Thank you,

669
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:28,770
Doctor. That was really heartfelt.

670
00:26:28,772 --> 00:26:30,972
And now is there anything that...

671
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:33,207
you'd like to apologize for, Mazikeen?

672
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,576
She just said she boned my ex.

673
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:36,767
I didn't do anything.

674
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,314
Well, it always takes two to tango.

675
00:26:39,317 --> 00:26:41,149
Yeah, Linda and Amenadiel.

676
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:42,583
One, two, naked tango.

677
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:44,152
Me, screwed.

678
00:26:44,154 --> 00:26:46,202
Resolving conflict means,

679
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:49,369
uh, accepting culpability on both sides.

680
00:26:49,372 --> 00:26:51,663
If you don't let all
the icky feelings out,

681
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,861
things tend to fester,

682
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,863
and turn gangrenous, and, well...

683
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,135
nobody likes losing a limb.

684
00:26:58,138 --> 00:26:59,404
Not true.

685
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:00,701
And I didn't do crap.

686
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,004
She called dibs.

687
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,049
On someone she doesn't
even have feelings for.

688
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:09,109
I'm a demon, Linda.

689
00:27:09,112 --> 00:27:10,128
What do you expect?

690
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:12,998
You can't admit to a
single thing you did wrong?

691
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:14,548
I've done a lot of things wrong.

692
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:15,850
Like, a lot.

693
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:19,120
But at least I don't
claim to be the good one.

694
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:21,456
Pretend to stand on
some moral high ground.

695
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,936
You know, despite all
the books you've read,

696
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,593
all the degrees on your wall,

697
00:27:25,595 --> 00:27:28,029
you forgot the one rule that matters.

698
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:30,498
Hos before bros.

699
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,333
Well, it's pretty tricky
to follow that rule

700
00:27:32,335 --> 00:27:35,464
when you seem to have slept
with, oh, half of Los Angeles.

701
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:36,871
And yet, you begrudge me

702
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:38,928
the one man I've cared about

703
00:27:38,931 --> 00:27:40,933
in a really long time.

704
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:44,272
And yet, I still gave him up.

705
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:49,350
That's how much I care
about our friendship.

706
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:58,158
Go... to... hell.

707
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,673
Okay. Great start.

708
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:04,764
Um, all part of the process.

709
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,068
Good time for a breather?

710
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,469
We're done.

711
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,075
Okay.

712
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,784
What on earth do you think you're doing?

713
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,402
You. Get naked.

714
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:27,005
I beg your pardon?

715
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,863
You said you wanted to
focus your attention on me.

716
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:31,824
Well, yes, but, uh...

717
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:34,060
And I always have sex
the night before a show.

718
00:28:34,063 --> 00:28:35,714
It... it calms me.

719
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:38,566
Well, I'm sorry, but you'd have
to tie me down with steel chains

720
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:39,774
to have sex with you.

721
00:28:39,777 --> 00:28:41,235
I'd be up for that.

722
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:43,671
No! What... it wasn't a suggestion!

723
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:45,706
Demanding. I like it.

724
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:46,824
- Miss Axara.
- Uh-huh?

725
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:49,097
- I love sex.
- What a coincidence. Me, too.

726
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,601
But, and this may be a first...

727
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,675
Okay.

728
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:55,243
I'm really not in the mood.

729
00:28:58,688 --> 00:29:00,191
You know what?

730
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:01,660
I don't think you like me.

731
00:29:01,663 --> 00:29:02,956
Really?

732
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,995
Whatever gave you that impression?

733
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:07,659
But... but everybody likes me.

734
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,223
Apart from the person
who tried to rocket you

735
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:11,487
- into a bloody red glare.
- Okay.

736
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,290
If you don't like me,
why were you so hell-bent

737
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:14,535
on being my bodyguard?

738
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:18,573
Because I'm trying to take my focus off

739
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:20,508
someone very dear to me.

740
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,694
But... a friend, actually.

741
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:25,052
Well, no, indeed, more a coworker.

742
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,272
Oh.

743
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:33,322
The detective you work with?

744
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:35,742
How did you...

745
00:29:35,745 --> 00:29:38,439
I may be a self-centered
diva, but I have eyes.

746
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,240
Why are you trying to convince yourself

747
00:29:40,243 --> 00:29:41,362
that you don't like her?

748
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,496
I'm not trying to convince my...

749
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,618
It's not me I'm trying to convince.

750
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:48,034
It's my Father.

751
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:49,870
I defied Him,

752
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,474
and He's big on that "eye
for an eye" sort of thing.

753
00:29:53,476 --> 00:29:56,677
So I'm afraid that
he's gonna come after...

754
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:59,408
the things that I care about the most.

755
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,449
Well, you're a cop, sort of.

756
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:02,994
Get a restraining order or something.

757
00:30:02,997 --> 00:30:04,627
Well, I'm afraid it's not that simple.

758
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,996
Dad's all-powerful.

759
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:07,275
Works in government?

760
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:08,783
Mm, rules the universe.

761
00:30:08,786 --> 00:30:10,486
Frickin' politicians.

762
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:13,059
Well, hey, if it helps,
I know how you feel.

763
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,596
After what happened at my show,
it seems like everyone's trying

764
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:18,032
to take away the thing
I care about the most.

765
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:19,700
What? Fresh turmeric?

766
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:23,404
Funny. Funny, but no.

767
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:25,573
Music.

768
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:26,941
Ah.

769
00:30:26,943 --> 00:30:28,309
But here's the deal.

770
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:31,479
You can't let anyone come in between you

771
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:35,049
and the things you're
passionate about in this life.

772
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:37,351
Or it ain't worth living.

773
00:30:38,554 --> 00:30:41,853
Well. Thank you, my self-centered diva,

774
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:43,890
for your counsel.

775
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:45,526
It's duly noted.

776
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:47,094
Hey, I don't know about you,

777
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,196
but I could use a drink.

778
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:51,799
Oh, well now you are
talking my language.

779
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:54,702
Long as it's not orange, right?

780
00:30:56,572 --> 00:30:58,372
Right.

781
00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:03,210
Lovely.

782
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:05,760
I wasn't sure if you're
a single malt girl...

783
00:31:10,163 --> 00:31:11,428
Bugger.

784
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,957
Epic toxicology report.

785
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,795
It turns out the manager
didn't just kill Benny,

786
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:18,270
he tortured him, too.

787
00:31:18,273 --> 00:31:19,933
I mean, it's bad enough
that he made him take

788
00:31:19,935 --> 00:31:21,368
all those sleeping
pills, but to force him

789
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,669
to eat all that stuff, too?

790
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:24,277
I mean, that is just cruel, man.

791
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,813
Wait, so what does this mean here?

792
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,106
Oh, right, sorry, yeah.

793
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:28,770
It's the chemical compounds.

794
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:32,379
So first, he fed Benny raw turmeric.

795
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:33,863
- Hmm.
- And kale.

796
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:35,181
A lot of kale.

797
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:38,018
And then, a boatload of spirulina.

798
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,355
But this all sounds like
ingredients for a smoothie.

799
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:41,699
Yeah, smoothie of death.

800
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:42,723
No, I mean, the pills.

801
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:44,224
It could've been blended into a smoothie

802
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:45,825
like the one that Axara drinks.

803
00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:47,594
Be a good way to disguise the taste.

804
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:49,929
You know what? I don't think
the manager's the killer.

805
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,337
Beard-to-misery quotient.

806
00:31:57,339 --> 00:31:59,005
It's a science, man.

807
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:02,876
After my divorce, I went
for the old Walter White.

808
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:06,046
Whatever you do, do not go full Hagrid.

809
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:08,145
Kenny Rogers, tops.

810
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:12,352
Oh, hey, uh, a buddy of mine's here.

811
00:32:12,354 --> 00:32:14,654
He's a real "glass
half full" kind of guy.

812
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,415
He actually pulled me
out of a dark spot once.

813
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:22,295
Hey.

814
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:24,497
Maybe he can help you out.

815
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:26,099
Amenadiel.

816
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:27,233
Pierce.

817
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:29,769
Or not.

818
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:31,235
Uh, since you guys

819
00:32:31,238 --> 00:32:33,402
obviously already know each other,

820
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:35,575
how about I just give you
some time to catch up? Hmm?

821
00:32:35,577 --> 00:32:37,177
Yeah, I saw a food truck

822
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:39,212
on the way in. I'm just
gonna grab myself a burger.

823
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:40,480
Protein style.

824
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,216
Something... Yeah. Okay.

825
00:32:43,218 --> 00:32:44,824
I'm gonna be back later.

826
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:49,456
I can't allow you to defy my father

827
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,324
or drag my brother
into one of your schemes

828
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:53,493
to remove your mark. This ends now.

829
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:56,308
Okay.

830
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,666
- Really?
- Yeah.

831
00:32:59,668 --> 00:33:01,067
Look, I'm way ahead of you.

832
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:02,669
I got my hopes up

833
00:33:02,671 --> 00:33:05,004
thinking that Decker was
the key, and then Lucifer.

834
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:06,510
But that's what the Sinnerman thought.

835
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:09,142
Then I thought resurrecting
Abel could end my curse.

836
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:10,710
But I made a mistake.

837
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:12,312
I was wrong.

838
00:33:12,314 --> 00:33:13,947
'Cause here I am, alive and well.

839
00:33:13,949 --> 00:33:15,949
Well, alive and miserable, actually.

840
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,517
So I'm done.

841
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,652
Finito.

842
00:33:19,654 --> 00:33:21,154
I quit.

843
00:33:21,156 --> 00:33:22,622
You happy?

844
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:24,924
Yes.

845
00:33:24,926 --> 00:33:26,066
Yes,

846
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:27,360
because this means I did it.

847
00:33:27,362 --> 00:33:29,662
I destroyed your alliance with Lucifer.

848
00:33:29,664 --> 00:33:31,431
I prevented you from defying my father.

849
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:32,902
I passed my test.

850
00:33:32,905 --> 00:33:34,968
If you passed your test,

851
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,936
why don't you have your wings back?

852
00:33:36,938 --> 00:33:39,672
Well, maybe my test has multiple parts.

853
00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:41,040
Um, if so, that's okay.

854
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,108
It's God's will.

855
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,309
- Right?
- How do you do that?

856
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:45,011
How do you stay so positive?

857
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:46,980
It's called faith, Pierce.

858
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,383
See, I spent a lot of
time doubting myself,

859
00:33:50,385 --> 00:33:52,519
but now I realize that
it's about the journey,

860
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:53,973
not the destination.

861
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:56,256
How could you possibly
have any faith or hope

862
00:33:56,258 --> 00:33:58,825

How could I ever leave this?

913
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:02,248
No one's ever gonna scare
me out of the spotlight.

914
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,750
Ever.

915
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:05,785
Yeah? Try me. Come on.

916
00:36:06,888 --> 00:36:07,987
You.

917
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,826
You were supposed to keep her safe.

918
00:36:13,828 --> 00:36:17,051
No offense, darling, but
you're the one with a knife.

919
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,480
What's with the knife, Cece?

920
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:25,761
You're gonna hurt someone.

921
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:26,795
Does it even matter?

922
00:36:26,797 --> 00:36:29,398
Two people are dead, you were shot at,

923
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,967
and you still won't stop.

924
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,303
Don't you see the danger you're in?

925
00:36:34,305 --> 00:36:37,321
Again, am I the only one
who sees the irony here?

926
00:36:37,324 --> 00:36:39,541
You said you would take a
break after the L.A. shows

927
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:41,443
and then you added Asia
and Europe to the tour.

928
00:36:41,445 --> 00:36:42,600
That's two more years.

929
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:43,879
- So?
- So?!

930
00:36:43,881 --> 00:36:45,203
That's two more years now.

931
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:46,849
And then another two and another two.

932
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:47,850
When does it end?

933
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:49,218
Never.

934
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,566
Hopefully.

935
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:53,937
I am tired of sharing you, Axara.

936
00:36:55,526 --> 00:36:56,967
Remember high school?

937
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,194
Before all of this.

938
00:36:59,196 --> 00:37:03,532
It was just you and me,
singing along to Beyoncé.

939
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:05,212
Well, you would sing,

940
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:08,306
I-I would just watch
and eat cookie dough.

941
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,474
I want that.

942
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:16,423
You have to know by now.

943
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:20,049
I love you.

944
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:21,583
Love me?

945
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:25,564
Oh, my God, Cece, what did you do?

946
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,389
She was trying to protect you.

947
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:30,359
Force you out of the spotlight
by any means necessary.

948
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:31,427
Even murder?

949
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:33,228
I-I didn't know what else to do.

950
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:35,530
You almost killed me.
How is that protecting me?

951
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:36,932
She was never trying to kill you.

952
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:39,178
Oh, what is she doing here?

953
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:40,615
Cece ran your social media.

954
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:43,038
It was easy for her to
start an account as you

955
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,673
and access all of your private texts.

956
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:46,709
So you knew about the
choreography switch.

957
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:49,096
I just wanted to scare you.

958
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,233
I'm never gonna stop singing, Cece.

959
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,915
Not even for me?

960
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:55,363
My music means more to me than anything.

961
00:37:57,755 --> 00:37:59,755
You have to know that by now.

962
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:05,627
Drop the knife, Cece, it's over.

963
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,346
No.

964
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,130
No!

965
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,115
No!

966
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:15,504
I just wanted her to be safe.

967
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:17,172
I know you did.

968
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:27,082
Well, who's the heroic one, now?

969
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:32,321
- What?
- Oh, my God. Lucifer, are you okay?

970
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,236
Why wouldn't I be okay?

971
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,623
Oh.

972
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:38,022
Oh, God, whatever you
do, don't pull it...

973
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:39,995
out!

974
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:42,264
Oops.

975
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:48,270
What were you thinking,

976
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:50,205
tackling somebody with a knife?

977
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:52,841
It's not me I was
worried about, Detective.

978
00:38:56,814 --> 00:38:58,493
Lucifer.

979
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:03,552
You see, it's like I was saying, Pierce.

980
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:08,489
You got to have faith
because life can surprise you.

981
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:10,459
Now, if my brother,

982
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:13,228
the Devil, can have that...

983
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,797
Maybe I can, too.

984
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:17,733
God.

985
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,844
Hey, look at you, buddy.

986
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:30,612
Seems like someone's feeling better.

987
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,349
Okay.

988
00:39:34,351 --> 00:39:37,553
Hi.

989
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:39,221
Lieutenant.

990
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:43,943
Congratulations on another solve.

991
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:45,694
Thank you.

992
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:47,362
Thanks, I appreciate that.

993
00:39:47,364 --> 00:39:49,272
I'm just glad Axara's okay.

994
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:51,990
Well, I guess more than okay.
Her show's back on for the night

995
00:39:51,993 --> 00:39:56,514
and she sent me two VIP
tickets to say thank you.

996
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:57,583
Well, you deserve them.

997
00:39:57,586 --> 00:39:58,748
So, who are you taking?

998
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:01,977
Oh, I don't know. It's just...

999
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:03,078
I thought you'd never ask.

1000
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,179
Oh.

1001
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:05,380
Yeah.

1002
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:07,068
Sure. Yeah, why not?

1003
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,951
- Great, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

1004
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,290
Morning, Detective.

1005
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:17,059
- What?
- What?

1006
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:19,615
You sure you don't want
to throw a surprise party

1007
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:21,530
for the guy in evidence lockup?

1008
00:40:22,762 --> 00:40:25,334
Ah, right, yes, I
suppose I deserve that.

1009
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:28,295
No, no, I am back to status quo.

1010
00:40:28,298 --> 00:40:30,072
- Hmm.
- Since I realized,

1011
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:32,841
ultimately, I can't control you

1012
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:34,631
or the world around
you, for that matter.

1013
00:40:34,634 --> 00:40:36,478
So there's no point trying to extinguish

1014
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,014
the proverbial spotlight, is there?

1015
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:41,772
I may just have to take a knife
to the chest every now and then.

1016
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,252
Right.

1017
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:45,267
Hello.

1018
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,189
Tickets for Axara's show. Tonight?

1019
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:49,825
Excellent.

1020
00:40:49,827 --> 00:40:51,701
Right, what time shall I pick you up?

1021
00:40:51,704 --> 00:40:54,062
Um...

1022
00:40:54,064 --> 00:40:55,615
Well...

1023
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:58,734
it didn't seem like
you were that interested

1024
00:40:58,736 --> 00:40:59,986
in hanging out with me lately,

1025
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:02,404
so Pierce and I are gonna go together.

1026
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:05,574
Oh. Right, yeah, of course.

1027
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:07,409
Of course. Well...

1028
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:09,444
have fun.

1029
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:11,213
