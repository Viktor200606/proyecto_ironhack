1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,577
<i>Previously on Lucifer.</i>

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,369
Lucifer Morningstar..

3
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,371
Is that a stage name or something?

4
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,206
God-given, I'm afraid.

5
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,541
Your return to the Underworld

6
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:11,042
has been requested.

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,011
Remind Dad that I quit Hell

8
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,480
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

9
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,582
Oh, don't say it. Come on, don't say it.

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,619
I'm now an official
civilian consultant for the LAPD.

11
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:23,154
I want what's best for Lucifer.

12
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:25,123
Then give me something
that I can use against Lucifer,

13
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,271
and I'll make sure you're
both back where you belong.

14
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,927
He doesn't confide in me anymore.

15
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:32,597
But there is someone he
does talk to... a doctor.

16
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,865
Hello there, neighbor.

17
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,535
I actually need someone to
confide in about a patient.

18
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,370
And hey, listen, if
you have any patients

19
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,906
- you need to talk about...
- You have no idea.

20
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:43,575
Just shoot me, Detective, please,

21
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:45,510
because maybe you'll finally realize...

22
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:47,612
You're bleeding.

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,514
What's happening to me?

24
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,417
You're changing, becoming vulnerable.

25
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,018
Maybe even...  mortal.

26
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:56,921
Oh, Mazie. I know that you'll
always protect me.

27
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,792
No matter how mortal I
become, the Devil can depend on that.

now, I'll go easy on you.

00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:27,272
So, tell me...

62
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:29,240
did you eat...

63
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,409
the chocolate cake?

64
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,579
No, Mommy.

65
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,016
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,385
It's just cake, Chloe.

67
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,620
Cake is so not the point, Dan.

68
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:44,422
This is about honesty

69
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,157
and personal responsibility.

70
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,092
Fine.

71
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,530
I got this.

72
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,334
Hey, Monkey.

73
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,736
Do you remember when we had that talk

74
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,172
and we said that
lying is a really bad thing?

75
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,573
Well,

76
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:04,442
some of your birthday cake is missing.

77
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,577
Now, I didn't eat it,

78
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:09,714
and we know Mommy didn't eat it, so...

79
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,342
is there something you want to tell us?

80
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,554
I ate it.

81
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:18,356
Mm-hmm.

82
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,458
But Lucifer said it was okay.

83
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,226
Oh, really?

84
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:24,940
He said, if you really want

85
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,099
to do something, you should.

86
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,269
And I really wanted to
eat some chocolate cake.

87
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,504
Huh. That's...

88
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,074
interesting.

89
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,244
Why don't you go grab your stuff.

90
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,451
Oh, I am so glad to
hear advice from Lucifer

91
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:48,619
is on the personal responsibility
lesson plan.

92
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:49,620
Dan, it's not what you think.

93
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:50,722
You know what, Chloe?

94
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,123
Your private life is
none of my business,

95
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,858
but when it comes to Trixie...

96
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:54,926
keep Lucifer out of it.

97
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,130
Decker.

98
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,899
Yeah, yeah. I'll hold.

99
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,969
Okay, just don't forget
tomorrow night's Taco Tuesday, okay?

100
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:07,105
- I can't do it.
- Why?

101
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:08,639
I'm working a stakeout in Van Nuys.

102
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:11,109
We agreed on planned
family time so that Trixie

103
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,378
can maintain some
normalcy during the separation.

104
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:15,646
I know, but... this is important.

105
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:17,415
I thought you wanted to work things out.

106
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,950
I don't have a choice,
Chloe. This is work.

107
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,418
Yeah, I've never heard that one before.

108
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,719
Yeah.

109
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:23,588
Long Beach?

110
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:25,323
Okay, I got it.

111
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,958
Thanks.

112
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,093
You know,

113
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,662
when Trixie asks where you are tomorrow,

114
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,866
I'll be sure to tell her
that something important came up.

115
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:40,471
Oh, Lucifer.
I brought the after...

116
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,540
after party.

117
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,476
Meet Brittany...

118
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,478
and Brittany.

119
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:48,546
Wow.

120
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,047
Hello, Brittanies.

121
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:53,117
Yes, very nice to meet you.

122
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,354
- Hello.
- Hello.

123
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,323
Shall we move the party upstairs?

124
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,526
I'll need my
clothes on, actually.

125
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,628
Sorry, girls. I'm late.

126
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:04,762
For what?

127
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,897
- Work.
- Please don't tell me

128
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,565
you actually believe you work

129
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,168
- for the police.
- Work for, work with.

130
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,569
I'm a civilian consultant.

131
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,571
The detective called.
There's been a murder.

132
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,772
My services are needed.

133
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,007
Brittanies...

134
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:19,177
why don't you make my friend
feel better, hmm?

135
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,230
And, uh, this
bruising is from what?

136
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,364
Possible imprint.

137
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,032
I'll know more once I'm back at the lab.

138
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,968
Okay. Call me when
you get something.

139
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,970
Howdy, partner.

140
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,805
We're not partners.

141
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,907
Right.

142
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:52,176
So, what unpleasantness

143
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,846
felled this heap of unrealized
ambition then?

144
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,981
Suffocation, a crushed trachea.

145
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,283
And this heap has a name.

146
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:02,186
Erwin Scovell, 55. He
worked security here for 20 years.

147
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:03,521
Ooh, talk about suffocating.

148
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,589
Vice suspects this place

149
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,290
has been used by criminal organizations

150
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:07,992
to store illegal contraband.

151
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,327
Container went missing,

152
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:12,396
so Scovell probably walked
in on a robbery in progress.

153
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:15,533
Security cameras were
disabled, so no video.

154
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,502
Probably gonna need to canvass the...

155
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,204
Lucifer, it's a dead body.

156
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,472
A little respect.

157
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,275
Do you know, I am amazed
by the deferential regard

158
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,743
you people hold for rotting flesh.

159
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:28,579
I mean, this poor
sap's either already in Hell

160
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,182
or in the Silver City
enduring Uriel's welcome speech,

161
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,384
which is far worse
than Hell, if you ask me.

162
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,653
Let's pretend for one
second that you're someone else.

163
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,755
Someone nice, someone mature.

164
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,690
Ooh, I love role-play.

165
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:40,658
Great.

166
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,193
So, since we don't have any leads,

167
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,495
let's focus on the next
steps of the investigation,

168
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,297
like what was in the stolen container.

169
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,866
But I've already solved
it. I know what killed Erwin.

170
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:50,201
What?

171
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,402
Boredom.

172
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,870
I mean, getting murdered is probably

173
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,273
the most exciting thing that
ever happened to him.

174
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,975
When do we get to raid a
drug house or shoot someone?

175
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,545
I mean, I gave up an
epic foursome to be here.

176
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:03,614
A man died, and we're going to
do everything we possibly can

177
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:04,882
to catch the killer.

178
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,484
Pass.

179
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,019
Are you joking?

180
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:09,287
Hard pass.

181
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:11,389
Hey! After all of your manipulations

182
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:14,025
to get to work with me, you're
really gonna walk away

183
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:15,612
because you think this case is boring?

184
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,296
Just call me when you've
got a murder with a pulse.

185
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,898
Or at least someone good-looking.

186
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,900
I mean...

187
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,037
Is the Brittany buffet still serving?

188
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,005
- Okay, got it.
- Huh?

189
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:29,840
God, I was hoping for a good shag

190
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,108
just as a palate cleanser

191
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,344
to wipe the foul taste
of boredom from my mouth.

192
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,512
We need to talk.

193
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,913
Well, as long as
it's not the detective's

194
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:39,183
homicide/robbery
snoozefest at the docks, I'm all ears.

195
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,052
You know, I don't know how they do it.

196
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,754
40 hours a week, 52
weeks a year, 50 years.

197
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:46,324
I mean, I didn't leave Hell just
to step into another one.

198
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,627
Yeah, well, about that robbery/homicide
snoozefest.

199
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,297
The container that's
missing, it was yours.

200
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,200
What container?

201
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,469
The container.

202
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:08,428
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.addic7ed.com -

203
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:19,660
Didn't you hear what I just said?

204
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:21,228
The container is missing.

205
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:22,897
I heard you.

206
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:25,132
Then why aren't we out
there recovering it?

207
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,435
Why fuss? I suppose if somebody wants it

208
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:29,036
badly enough to steal it,

209
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:31,305
then perhaps they should have it, then.

210
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,708
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:35,309
This doesn't upset you?

212
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:37,311
I don't know what to tell you, Maze.

213
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:40,214
I guess it's not that
important to me after all.

214
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,351
Well, it's your container...

215
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:45,453
and your reputation.

216
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:48,356
What about my reputation?

217
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:51,425
Well, apparently, it's
okay to steal from you now.

218
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:52,660
But...

219
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:55,896
if it doesn't bother
you... doesn't bother me.

220
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:07,808
We're
canvassing the entire area

221
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:08,876
for witnesses now, ma'am.

222
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,944
Okay, good. Let's check

223
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:10,945
with the nearby businesses,

224
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:11,979
- All right.
- and check the...

225
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:13,848
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

226
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:15,249
What? Have you thought of
all new offensive things

227
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,751
- to say?
- No, I've changed mind.

228
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:18,753
I've come back to help. Any leads yet?

229
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,688
I need your help like
I need a third boob.

230
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:21,856
- Mmm!
- Wait.

231
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:23,724
Don't say a word. Knew it was a mistake

232
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,355
the minute it came out of my mouth.

233
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,361
We're partners, and I'm
offering you my services.

234
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,830
I think you need a refresher course

235
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:31,132
on how partnership works.

236
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,900
You left me hanging, remember?

237
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:34,735
Yes, but now I'm here
because of the robbery.

238
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:36,270
Robbery? Why?

239
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:38,239
Because the container that
was stolen was mine.

240
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:40,975
You somehow left that out before.

241
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,176
Well, I didn't know before.

242
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:43,511
Maze handles
logistics... storage and such.

243
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:46,247
And did you know that
this facility was used

244
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:48,582
- to house illegal contraband?
- No.

245
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,084
But what better place to store my stuff

246
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:51,419
than somewhere
people hide illicit goods?

247
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:52,520
Asking the obvious here,

248
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:54,989
but was your stuff illegal
contraband, too?

249
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:56,857
Define "illegal."

250
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:58,526
What was in the container?

251
00:10:58,593 --> 00:11:01,262
- A personal item, insignificant.
- Yeah, but what was in it?

252
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:02,963
The only thing I
brought with me to Los Angeles.

253
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:04,198
I know, but you're not
answering the question.

254
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:06,267
Look, I was storing
some stuff, it was stolen,

255
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:07,568
the theft sets an awful precedent,

256
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:09,737
so I'm obliged to make
the person responsible pay.

257
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:12,406
Now, if you let me help,

258
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:16,277
I'm certain we can solve
this case quickly.

259
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:17,812
And I have a lead.

260
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:23,884
Snow cones?

261
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:24,952
This is your lead?

262
00:11:24,953 --> 00:11:26,353
We don't have time for this.

263
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:27,922
We should be working.

264
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:29,757
- What can I get you?
- Uh, yes.

265
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:31,292
I'll have two Tropic Wonders

266
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,536
and your face smashed into the ground.

267
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:34,576
What?

268
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:37,164
What the...?

269
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:38,432
Lucifer, what are you doing? Stop!

270
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,067
I believe they call this interrogating.

271
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:41,402
Lucifer, stop!

272
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,870
- He needs to tell me where my stuff is.
- Don't.

273
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:44,618
- I just sell snow cones.
- Lucifer!

274
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:45,973
This isn't how we do things.

275
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,175
This pathetic sap's real
name is Frankie Costa,

276
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:50,978
and his real job is
transporting and storing illegal goods.

277
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,980
Maze set up the warehouse through him.

278
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:55,249
So if someone knew to
rob it, he'd be involved.

279
00:11:56,284 --> 00:11:57,852
I wouldn't steal from my own operation.

280
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,321
That warehouse is off-limits.

281
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:01,388
Hey, man.

282
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:03,657
I'm trying to get out
of the storage racket.

283
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:04,725
Yes, focus, Frankie.

284
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:05,726
Who took my property?

285
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:06,760
I don't know.

286
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:08,662
I'm trying to find out myself.

287
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,897
This is bad for business.

288
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,098
And who would know
about the storage service?

289
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:11,932
Who are you?

290
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,767
I'm someone with one of these.

291
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:14,768
But this guy doesn't have one.

292
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:16,036
So say if I were to walk away,

293
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:18,272
he can do whatever he wants to you.

294
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,274
Of if you're not
responsible, you can point us

295
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:22,409
in the right direction
of someone who is. Cool?

296
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:23,744
Okay, okay.

297
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:25,779
Los Diablos.

298
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:26,981
The biker club?

299
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:28,315
Yeah.

300
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:30,484
I run the warehouse, but
they run the docks.

301
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:33,821
If anything went down, they
would know about it.

302
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,222
That's all I know.

303
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,423
I swear.

304
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:38,158
All right, all right.

305
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:39,960
Fine.

306
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:45,232
That was incredible.

307
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,967
It was musical, poetic really.

308
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,702
We were like fish and
chips, salt and pepper.

309
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,970
Hipsters and condescension.

310
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:51,038
Give me one good reason

311
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:53,240
why I shouldn't arrest you for assault.

312
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:54,708
Fine, Frankie's a complete scumbag,

313
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:55,709
and he skimps on the cherry syrup.

314
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:56,777
So that's two, actually.

315
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:57,978
Uh, something's going on with you,

316
00:12:58,046 --> 00:12:59,780
and it has to do with that
mysterious container,

317
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:01,088
so no more games... what's in it?

318
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,051
It was a gift from my father.

319
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:05,519
That's still not an answer.

320
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:06,867
I mean, what, was it his memoirs?

321
00:13:06,888 --> 00:13:08,856
Some priceless porn collection?

322
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:10,024
Look, if we're gonna
work together on this,

323
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,760
you're gonna have
to trust me, all right?

324
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:16,330
You're right, we
shouldn't work together on this.

325
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:19,767
Aren't we being a touch dramatic?

326
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,168
You know, I put up with a lot of crap

327
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,436
to let you in on my cases,

328
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:24,138
and that's because thus
far you've been honest with me,

329
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:26,774
but now, for some reason,
you're not telling me the full story.

330
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,075
I'm telling you

331
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:30,177
everything you need to
know to help find my stuff.

332
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:32,546
A man was murdered, and all you
can talk about is your property?

333
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:34,582
Yes, but if we find
it, then you find out

334
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:37,084
who killed the security guard...
it's win-win.

335
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:39,286
So, please, enlighten me.

336
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:41,322
Under what rock
will we find Los Diablos?

337
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,657
It's a very on-the-nose name,
if you ask me.

338
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:44,892
We won't find them anywhere.

339
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,860
It's a conflict of interest.

340
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:56,637
Look, Chloe, I told you,
there's nothing I can do about tomorrow.

341
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:57,938
Truce.

342
00:13:58,006 --> 00:13:59,640
This is a call for Dan the detective.

343
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,608
All right?

344
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:01,675
I need your help.

345
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:02,676
Okay.

346
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:03,877
It's about my case.

347
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:05,179
Homicide at the docks.

348
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,880
Security guard killed during a robbery.

349
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:08,749
Yeah, that container that was stolen,

350
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,017
it was Lucifer's.

351
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:13,687
That storage facility was
filled with black market goods.

352
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:16,323
Yeah, it was.

353
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,425
You think what Lucifer had stored
in there may be illegal.

354
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:20,694
Whatever is in that
container, he won't tell me.

355
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:23,897
And for a man who's all
about over-sharing, says a lot,

356
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:25,205
so I want you to look into him,

357
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:27,368
try and find out what
he might be hiding.

358
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:29,536
Absolutely.

359
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:41,148
LAPD.

360
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:42,516
Boss is out.

361
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:43,984
Yes, I know.

362
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:48,555
What do you want?

363
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:49,790
I need to see your books.

364
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,692
Without any foreplay?

365
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,427
Your boss has reported an operating loss

366
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:54,561
for the last five years.

367
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,163
So?

368
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:58,165
So this club is packed every night.

369
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,768
At 20 bucks an
appletini, it doesn't really add up.

370
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,839
You're Chloe's ex, right?

371
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:08,575
And you're Lucifer's pet on a leash.

372
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:09,943
Now answer the question.

373
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:12,413
Well, technically, that
wasn't a question.

374
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,814
Is your divorce final yet?

375
00:15:13,882 --> 00:15:15,182
That's none of your business.

376
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:17,651
Now, are you gonna show me your records,

377
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,319
or do I need to get a warrant?

378
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:20,387
We have nothing to hide.

379
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:21,422
That's great.

380
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:23,190
I'll be right here.

381
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:24,725
Mm-hmm.

382
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:27,094
Actually, the books are in the office.

383
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:30,798
And there are way too many
of them to carry all by myself.

384
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:33,801
But if you come out back with me,

385
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:36,003
I'll let you see whatever you want.

386
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:38,272
Just the books is fine.

387
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:43,744
Right this way.

388
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:53,253
Straight ahead, to the left.

389
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:09,177
When Chloe told you to
leave, how did that make you feel?

390
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:10,545
Well, pissed off, of course.

391
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:13,482
Whatever was stolen from you
must have been very important.

392
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:14,583
No.

393
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,686
Actually, no, it's the
principle at stake here.

394
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:21,189
I mean, nobody steals from
me and gets away with it.

395
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:24,726
This loss brings up an
issue that we've been skirting

396
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:26,328
since we began our work together.

397
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,563
- Right.
- Your identity.

398
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:30,832
It's
still the Devil, darling.

399
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,903
Yes, but who are you trying
so hard to become?

400
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:36,171
Nobody.

401
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,573
I'm completely unbecoming.

402
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,909
And yet you keep trying on many
hats to hide your horns.

403
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:42,878
Playboy, cop, club owner...

404
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:45,313
Yes, you forgot "master of
all things tongue-related."

405
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,382
Speaking of which, shall we?

406
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,583
That's for later.

407
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:51,553
I think we're onto
something very important here.

408
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:55,390
One of the hardest things we ever do...

409
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,792
is learn to be ourselves.

410
00:16:56,859 --> 00:17:00,962
I want you to tell me who you believe...

411
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,865
is the real you.

412
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,171
I...

413
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:12,774
I am...

414
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:16,144
second-guessing your
skills as a therapist.

415
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:20,715
You're feeling judged.

416
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,185
So you're lashing out and judging me.

417
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,252
But that's excellent.

418
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:25,387
It's transference.

419
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:26,888
Which means you seek my approval.

420
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:28,690
I seek no one's approval.

421
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:31,293
And time's up.

422
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,894
Suddenly I'm no
longer in the amorous mood.

423
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:35,197
Okay, hold on...

424
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,332
Hold on, Lucifer.

425
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:40,735
You think that's a fight.

426
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:43,405
I think it's progress.

427
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:47,142
Or maybe I'm just realizing
what a waste of time this is.

428
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,252
I'm glad you came ba...

429
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,354
- Oh.
- Is everything okay?

430
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:01,356
It's-it's you. Hi.

431
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:04,559
I'm sorry, it's just, uh, thin walls.

432
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:05,360
Oh.

433
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:06,795
Yes, everything's fine.

434
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:10,966
Uh, please.

435
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,168
Thanks again for
drinks the other night, Linda.

436
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:15,637
Uh, yeah.

437
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:17,105
Yes, that was fun.

438
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:18,974
Yeah.

439
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,911
All right, so what kind of parent
names their kid Lucifer?

440
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:26,281
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be unprofessional, but...

441
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:27,849
We're colleagues. Cone of silence.

442
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:31,186
And I don't believe his
real name is Lucifer.

443
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:33,889
We talk in metaphors.

444
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:35,156
Mmm.

445
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:37,425
Patients with delusions.

446
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:39,127
They can be really challenging.

447
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:41,263
Mm, he's actually quite charming.

448
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,266
Yeah, but even Satan disguises himself

449
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,400
as an angel of the light.

450
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:47,802
2 Corinthians, chapter 11, verse 14.

451
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,838
Ah.

452
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:51,740
Two years of seminary school

453
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:55,076
before I decided I wanted to help
people in a different way.

454
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:57,212
Ah. Interesting.

455
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,949
I thought you seemed... pure.

456
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,653
Listen, you really helped me
with my patient the other day,

457
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,788
and I would love to return the favor.

458
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:09,357
I know the Bible inside and out,

459
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,660
so if you ever need a consult,

460
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,828
just let me know.

461
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:42,424
Whoa.

462
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:44,192
Just
quit defending him, Mom.

463
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,661
You know Dan's never gonna change.

464
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:50,131
Mm-hmm.

465
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:53,201
What's for dinner, Mommy?

466
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,470
Greens, you little cake monster.

467
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:57,305
Yeah.

468
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:00,308
I mean, I don't know why
I even bother telling you.

469
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:02,610
He's-he's not gonna change, Mom.

470
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,980
You know, Dan's just the way he is,

471
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:06,481
and I wasn't asking for the world.

472
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:08,450
I just wanted to see a little effort,

473
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,617
and it's probably too late.

474
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:14,222
Ah, it's pointless to
discuss this with you.

475
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,726
Why? Because you always take his side.

476
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:21,329
Look, Mom, I...

477
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:23,098
- Daddy!
- Shh!

478
00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:25,633
- Hey, Monkey!
- What are you doing here?

479
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:28,703
And why are you wearing a pillow?

480
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:31,072
Well, those are...
that... those are great questions,

481
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,341
and I'm gonna answer both of them later.

482
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,810
But right now, I need
you to do something for me.

483
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:37,078
What?

484
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:40,215
Get me some clothes, and
don't tell Mommy that I'm here.

485
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,983
I thought you said lying
was a bad thing.

486
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:46,321
It is, it's terrible, but
this-this is different.

487
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:47,689
Because we're gonna play a game.

488
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:50,091
It's called "Sneak
Daddy Out of the House."

489
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,793
That still sounds like a lie.

490
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:55,563
You know, it's complicated, Monkey.

491
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,066
You're just gonna
have to go with it, okay?

492
00:20:58,134 --> 00:20:59,768
What's in it for me?

493
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,436
What do you want?

494
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:03,505
- Chocolate cake.
- Done.

495
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:06,808
- For a whole year.
- Absolutely not.

496
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,810
Mommy, I'm thirsty!

497
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:10,845
Okay, fine.

498
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:12,614
Done.

499
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:15,617
Now will you please go
get me some clothes?

500
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:24,325
What the hell did you do to me?

501
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:26,628
What do you mean?

502
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,363
One second, I'm standing here,

503
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:30,331
next second, I'm in my ex's bed naked.

504
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:32,534
Well, you're welcome.

505
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:34,202
So,

506
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,837
did it work?

507
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:36,905
You two have sex?

508
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:38,139
No.

509
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:41,042
Why would you think that
putting me in her bed naked

510
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,277
would get us to have sex?

511
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,512
- Always works for me.
- And why would

512
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,147
you even want Chloe and I to have sex?

513
00:21:46,215 --> 00:21:48,083
So that you and her will
get back together,

514
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,550
and she'll be out of Lucifer's life.

515
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:50,885
You're not from around here, are you?

516
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:53,054
You have no idea.

517
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:55,242
You can't just smash two
people together like Barbies,

518
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:56,825
and think that that's gonna fix things.

519
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:59,094
Relationships, they
take time and effort.

520
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:01,596
And you got to work at it, like...

521
00:22:01,664 --> 00:22:03,364
it's your job.

522
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:07,135
Humans are so exhausting.

523
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:09,370
Here are the books you wanted to see.

524
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:11,439
Oh, no, we're not through here.

525
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,741
You assaulted a police officer.

526
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,810
I'm taking you in.

527
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:17,112
And what exactly

528
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,681
are you going to say happened?

529
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:21,816
Hmm?

530
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,020
That a tiny female bartender

531
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:27,622
knocked you out,

532
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,257
stripped you naked

533
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:31,659
and put you in your ex's bed?

534
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,250
I can't explain it.

535
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:44,739
Lux's books are clean.

536
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:45,974
How is that even possible?

537
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,208
I had them run for
discrepancies with receivables.

538
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:49,043
I looked for hidden payments.

539
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:50,912
Whatever Lucifer's into,

540
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,347
it's not running through Lux.

541
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,781
All right, thanks for trying.

542
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:56,818
Listen, Chloe...

543
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:58,486
I want to talk to
you about Taco Tuesday.

544
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:01,122
Hey, Dan, I got to go.

545
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:05,260
Next time you secretly
follow someone, don't tailgate them.

546
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:06,528
Draws a little attention.

547
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,096
It's not my fault you
drive like an elderly turtle.

548
00:23:08,164 --> 00:23:09,164
Lucifer...

549
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:10,231
go home.

550
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:11,332
Detective...

551
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
It sucks not getting what you want.

552
00:23:12,468 --> 00:23:13,635
Now you have to deal with it

553
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:14,702
like the rest of us.

554
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:16,938
I'm sorry.

555
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,973
What did you just say?

556
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,009
I apologize.

557
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:22,844
I crossed the line this morning
with Mr. Snow Cone.

558
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:24,445
It was a mistake.

559
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:25,647
I realize that now.

560
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:27,115
Wow.

561
00:23:27,183 --> 00:23:28,249
You must really be desperate.

562
00:23:28,317 --> 00:23:29,784
I prefer determined.

563
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:31,619
Look, I need your help to find my stuff.

564
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:34,389
But you have to admit I've
proven myself useful.

565
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:35,523
Despite the methods employed,

566
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:37,225
Frankie did give us a solid lead.

567
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,793
Insanely wild guess,

568
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:40,661
but this is where
we'll find some Los Diablos.

569
00:23:40,696 --> 00:23:42,397
There's an imprint on the victim's neck

570
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,133
that we found under UV light.

571
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:47,202
Killer must've worn
some kind of bracelet

572
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:48,937
when he strangled the security guard.

573
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:50,371
Cross look familiar?

574
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:53,841
Well, what do you know?

575
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:55,210
Our suspect awaits.

576
00:23:55,277 --> 00:23:57,412
Shall we?

577
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:17,165
What happened to the music?

578
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,233
Hey! Come on, man!

579
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
What are you doing, man?

580
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:20,401
What is this? What's going on here?

581
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:22,036
What's going on with that?

582
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:24,339
Excuse me!

583
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:25,406
Pardon the intrusion,

584
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:27,809
you Village People rejects,

585
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:30,979
but one of you has stolen something
that belongs to me.

586
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:34,549
So please identify yourself, so
I can punish you accordingly.

587
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,354
Who do you think you are?

588
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:52,420
I thought we were past you
thinking you're invincible.

589
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:54,822
I really want to find my stuff.

590
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,224
What the hell did you just say?

591
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:59,327
Hmm? Harry Potter?

592
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:01,162
There you go.

593
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,763
Mess him up, Renny.

594
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:04,332
Well, since you're obviously lower

595
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:06,100
on the human evolutionary chain,

596
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:08,302
perhaps your hearing hasn't developed
as well as it should,

597
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,804
so I'll repeat myself.

598
00:25:09,872 --> 00:25:11,239
Who...

599
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:12,306
stole...

600
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:13,341
my...

601
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:14,609
property?

602
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:19,514
Everybody back the hell
off or you're going to jail.

603
00:25:28,624 --> 00:25:29,624
Pardon my boys.

604
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:30,958
They don't always have the best, uh,

605
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:33,094
people skills.

606
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:34,862
Take a breather, Renny.

607
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,930
Now!

608
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:38,699
Be cool.

609
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:39,867
Hank Cutter.

610
00:25:39,935 --> 00:25:41,836
I'm in charge here.

611
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:45,106
Oh, a Mrs. Police. How are you?

612
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:47,441
Why don't we chat in my office, okay?

613
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:48,509
Follow me.

614
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,712
We heard that you control the docks,

615
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,282
and if anything goes
down, Los Diablos are in on it.

616
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:56,484
Really? We're just a riding club, okay?

617
00:25:56,552 --> 00:26:00,421
Whose members have been
arrested for guns, drugs, murder.

618
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:02,356
A few bad apples shouldn't paint us all

619
00:26:02,424 --> 00:26:03,904
in a bad light, now should it, ma'am?

620
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:05,393
But it does paint you as suspects.

621
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,295
Hey, look, just because we
have a reputation as outlaws

622
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:10,598
doesn't mean we had
anything to do with a murder.

623
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:13,467
You like being
considered a criminal, don't you?

624
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:16,904
Yeah, you do.

625
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:18,506
What else do you want?

626
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:25,479
To own a clothing line.

627
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:26,314
Oh.

628
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:27,448
Clothing line?

629
00:26:27,516 --> 00:26:30,151
I-I did not see that one coming.

630
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:32,119
Yes, managing bikers
must be so exhausting.

631
00:26:32,187 --> 00:26:34,155
All that brawling and pillaging.

632
00:26:34,222 --> 00:26:35,856
- I'm 54.
- Really?

633
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:38,192
I'd rather be in my
hammock playing my Stratocaster.

634
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,528
All this motorcycle
riding's enlarged my prostate.

635
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:42,029
It's unpleasant.

636
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:43,898
That's an
unfortunate occupational hazard.

637
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:45,299
Tell me about it.

638
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:46,534
Look, we've trademarked our name.

639
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:47,835
We're selling T-shirts and jackets,

640
00:26:47,903 --> 00:26:49,103
and we're gonna re-brand and...

641
00:26:49,137 --> 00:26:50,538
go legit.

642
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:51,639
"Legit."

643
00:26:51,707 --> 00:26:54,108
There's a lot of money
in the apparel industry.

644
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,611
All the more reason to
keep our noses clean.

645
00:26:56,678 --> 00:26:58,479
See, we used to cover
the docks, not anymore.

646
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:01,449
I specifically ordered them off-limits.

647
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:03,156
Maybe someone missed
the re-branding memo.

648
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:06,354
Killer wore a
bracelet with an iron cross.

649
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:09,390
Left an imprint on the dead security
guard at the warehouse.

650
00:27:13,195 --> 00:27:16,330
Look, uh, a lot of
bikers wear iron crosses.

651
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:19,367
Yeah, well, I'm interested in your
guys who have iron crosses.

652
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:24,105
Hey, look, I've told
you everything I know.

653
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:25,206
If you have any more questions,

654
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:26,974
feel free to contact my attorney.

655
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:27,975
But we're not finished yet.

656
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:30,344
Yeah, we're done.

657
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:32,179
Thank you.

658
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:39,120
But why are we leaving?

659
00:27:39,187 --> 00:27:40,588
He's hiding something.

660
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:41,489
It's obvious.

661
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:42,623
We need to force it out of him.

662
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:44,892
We have this little
thing called due process.

663
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,560
We can't just force
things out of people.

664
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:48,963
Besides, there's an easier
way to get our bad guy.

665
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:53,534
You saw the look on
Cutter's face when he saw that photo.

666
00:27:53,602 --> 00:27:55,202
He knows exactly who robbed the docks.

667
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,238
He's gonna need to
deal with this immediately.

668
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:59,573
Or it puts his plan to
re-brand in jeopardy.

669
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:00,708
Defying his orders...

670
00:28:00,776 --> 00:28:02,376
it's a huge challenge to his authority.

671
00:28:02,444 --> 00:28:04,578
He's not gonna want to deal
with this in public.

672
00:28:04,646 --> 00:28:06,013
Bet you the first person he goes to see

673
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:07,381
is the owner of that bracelet.

674
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:09,950
What, so your strategy is
just to sit here, paralyzed,

675
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:12,553
hoping that Cutter leads
us to the suspect?

676
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:13,854
What a terrible idea.

677
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:15,423
Hmm, you think so?

678
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,957
I do, I mean, for one,

679
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:18,292
even though Cutter's no brain surgeon,

680
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,694
surely he wouldn't just...

681
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:20,861
Wouldn't what?

682
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:29,136
Well done, Detective.

683
00:28:34,443 --> 00:28:36,544
A toast to Dr. Linda Martin,

684
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:38,612
therapist to the Devil himself.

685
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:42,249
I should put that on the door.

686
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:44,485
Mm, well, it sounds like he's dealing

687
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:45,786
with some genuine issues.

688
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:48,289
I'm just having such a hard
time getting through to him.

689
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:51,258
Maybe it's because you've
been humoring his metaphor

690
00:28:51,326 --> 00:28:52,693
without fully embracing it.

691
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:55,529
You mean, completely accept
that he's actually the Devil?

692
00:28:55,597 --> 00:28:57,331
Mm-hmm.

693
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:59,166
It's worth a try.

694
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:02,103
If only I knew someone who
could help me with the Bible.

695
00:29:03,472 --> 00:29:06,173
I know so much about it, it's
almost as if I was there.

696
00:29:08,176 --> 00:29:12,213
If he's positioning himself
as the Devil, right?

697
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,014
He must see himself as evil.

698
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:15,082
Mm!

699
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:15,916
No.

700
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:17,451
Actually, he's struggling.

701
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,488
I think he thinks other
people see him as evil.

702
00:29:20,555 --> 00:29:23,357
You seem attached to this patient.

703
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:24,892
I am...

704
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,995
very motivated to help him.

705
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:29,063
I see.

706
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:30,698
Well, um,

707
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:32,933
every culture in the world

708
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,636
and throughout history, for that matter,

709
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:37,538
has its very own myth of the Devil.

710
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:38,939
Mm-hmm.

711
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:41,142
But the one thing that
they all have in common

712
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:44,545
is that the Devil is essentially
a rebellious son.

713
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:45,780
Sounds like my guy.

714
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:47,181
I thought it might.

715
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:48,582
Now, if you're really serious

716
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,130
about embracing the metaphor, Linda...

717
00:29:50,152 --> 00:29:53,287
truly embracing it... I
know how you can get to him.

718
00:29:53,355 --> 00:29:55,556
But he might not
like what you have to say.

719
00:29:55,624 --> 00:29:56,957
But will it help him?

720
00:29:57,025 --> 00:30:00,294
He may not realize it, but yes.

721
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:01,562
Then let's do it.

722
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:16,898
I've sat in a parked
car and not had sex.

723
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:18,966
Ew.

724
00:30:21,637 --> 00:30:23,338
You can't enjoy this.

725
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,706
This sitting around endlessly,

726
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:27,275
waiting for something to happen.

727
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,477
You know, if sitting
here not being entertained

728
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:30,812
is so terrible, then maybe it's a sign

729
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,039
you should be somewhere else.

730
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,748
Have I done something to offend you?

731
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:36,484
Only every time I see you.

732
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:38,586
Ha, ha, ha. No, this is different.

733
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,591
For the first time, I
don't think you're being

734
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:44,892
honest with me. You have this

735
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,494
mysterious container that was stolen

736
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:48,596
that someone was willing to kill for.

737
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:51,232
You make shady deals with shady people.

738
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,700
You're violent.

739
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:56,404
Your personal records only go
back five years, and the books

740
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:57,572
from Lux are way too clean.

741
00:30:57,639 --> 00:30:58,873
It's...

742
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,608
I had Dan go and check it out.

743
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:02,977
You had Dan deal with Maze alone?

744
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:04,245
Oh, dear. For the first time,

745
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:06,748
I actually feel
sorry for Detective Douche.

746
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:09,016
It all points to you being a criminal.

747
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:11,486
So what's the big deal?
What if I am a criminal?

748
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:12,754
I'd have to arrest you.

749
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:14,122
Ooh, whip out the
cuffs, then. Why shy away

750
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:15,890
from a little bondage fun?

751
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,925
You know, Lucifer, this is serious.

752
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,360
And despite all your weirdness

753
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:21,629
I...

754
00:31:21,697 --> 00:31:24,165
I actually really like working with you.

755
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:30,138
So, anyhow...

756
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:31,439
What a momentous

757
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:34,509
revelation, Detective
Decker. We should celebrate.

758
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:36,077
You can celebrate from jail

759
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,479
when it turns out I'm right about you.

760
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:40,248
I have never lied to you.

761
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,649
And I will

762
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:43,885
never lie to you.

763
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:47,155
What was in the container?

764
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,261
Russian dolls.

765
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,163
Russian dolls?

766
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,673
Here we go.

767
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:10,445
Oh, I knew it was

768
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,679
gonna be that Renny guy.

769
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:13,047
About that warehouse...!

770
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,284
Think I won't?

771
00:32:18,454 --> 00:32:19,754
This is Unit 831.

772
00:32:19,822 --> 00:32:23,691
Shots fired at 21st and Lewis.
We need backup and an ambo, now.

773
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,593
Unit 831,

774
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:27,762
all units in the vicinity...

775
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:28,723
There.

776
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:47,508
Bloody mortality.

777
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,789
Been a while since I had a good hunt.

778
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,564
That tingling sensation

779
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,532
running up your spine... inevitability.

780
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,035
And the bit running down your leg?

781
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:15,436
Fear.

782
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,765
Now...

783
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,302
you give me what is mine.

784
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,038
Wasn't my idea, I swear.

785
00:34:52,908 --> 00:34:54,628
He didn't tell me what
was in the container.

786
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:58,579
But I looked.

787
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:01,248
I saw them.

788
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:03,884
Who stole them?

789
00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:06,053
Oh, God...

790
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:08,556
Oh, God...

791
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:11,158
Who... stole them?

792
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,195
They were yours.

793
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:17,031
Who stole them?

794
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,566
I'm sorry.

795
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:20,768
I'm so sorry.

796
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:21,602
Oh...

797
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,704
you are gonna more than sorry

798
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:26,307
unless you tell me everything.

799
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,441
Please. Please, don't...

800
00:35:27,509 --> 00:35:28,909
No!

801
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:30,177
No! No!

802
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:31,379
No, don't!

803
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,590
I couldn't stop him.

804
00:35:58,548 --> 00:36:00,348
Hey, you all right?

805
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:03,819
Looks like Cutter's gonna make it.

806
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:05,788
He just gave a statement.

807
00:36:05,855 --> 00:36:07,056
Cutter?

808
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,023
The guy Renny shot.

809
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:09,725
Renny was pissed about the direction.

810
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,627
Of the club, he
thought they were selling out.

811
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:12,895
So he went out on his own,

812
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,564
robbed the warehouse and
killed the security guard.

813
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:18,500
We got justice

814
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:20,569
- for Erwin Scovell.
- Wonderful.

815
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:24,106
And they've recovered one container

816
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:25,574
belonging to...

817
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,109
a Lucifer Morningstar.

818
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:28,177
Where?

819
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:29,378
Inside.

820
00:36:29,446 --> 00:36:31,326
You didn't take a sneaky
peek before telling me?

821
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:34,116
You'd never lie to me, right?

822
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,953
You're gonna watch me open it.

823
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:43,358
You're damn right.

824
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,030
Wow.

825
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:27,669
Hmm...

826
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:32,941
I told you.

827
00:37:42,652 --> 00:37:44,686
Why go to all this trouble for dolls?

828
00:37:44,754 --> 00:37:46,088
Oh, come now, Detective.

829
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:48,824
I have to keep some
mysteries for myself.

830
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,864
Enjoy your dolls.

831
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:27,663
They're gone.

832
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:43,245
Want to grab that?

833
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,116
Hi, Daddy.

834
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,484
Hey, Monkey.

835
00:38:49,552 --> 00:38:53,856
This is for after dinner, okay?

836
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,293
- Hey.
- Hey.

837
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,662
Thought you had an important work thing.

838
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,598
Well, it wasn't as important

839
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,967
as having tacos with Trixie.

840
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:06,034
And you.

841
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,872
That is, if it's not too late.

842
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:11,206
Yeah.

843
00:39:11,274 --> 00:39:13,375
We're just making the salsa.

844
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:15,277
Great.

845
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,847
That smells so yummy.

846
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:19,815
Oh, good.

847
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:22,084
I'm glad you came back.

848
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,919
Well, I needed to
get my parking validated.

849
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,256
So your items were never recovered?

850
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,323
No.

851
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,358
Earlier, you said

852
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:32,628
that the items weren't that important.

853
00:39:32,695 --> 00:39:36,164
Yet now, you seem very
upset that they're gone.

854
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:37,432
Well, I'm a walking paradox.

855
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,102
What can I say?

856
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,770
Sometimes we need to lose something

857
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,706
before we can understand its value.

858
00:39:44,774 --> 00:39:46,408
I didn't lose anything.

859
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:47,476
No.

860
00:39:47,477 --> 00:39:48,797
No, you were a victim of a crime.

861
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:52,414
It's only natural that
you would feel violated.

862
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:53,722
And often, our feelings of loss

863
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,284
connect to how we feel...

864
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,185
about who we are.

865
00:39:57,253 --> 00:39:58,820
Oh, right.

866
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:00,422
So we're back on that, are we?

867
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,957
You want to talk about my identity.

868
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,659
Yes, because you're the Devil.

869
00:40:03,726 --> 00:40:04,927
You told me your names.

870
00:40:04,994 --> 00:40:07,162
But you left out a few others.

871
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,430
Abaddon.

872
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:09,731
Belial.

873
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:11,099
Prince of Darkness...

874
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,718
Someone's been brushing
up on their Sunday school.

875
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,704
Yes. But before you
fell, you were known as Samael.

876
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:18,307
The Lightbringer.

877
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,309
I don't go by that name anymore.

878
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,744
That was a name that
connotated your father's love for you.

879
00:40:22,812 --> 00:40:25,314
Right.

880
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,482
Was casting his son into Hell

881
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,117
also an expression of his love?

882
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:30,953
Oh, God didn't cast you out of Heaven

883
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,721
because he was angry with you.

884
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:35,958
How can you presume to
know God's intentions?

885
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:37,192
Oh, I don't.

886
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,160
I can't.

887
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,547
Then maybe stick within the limits

888
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,629
of your intellectual capacity.

889
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:42,164
Or maybe my simplicity

890
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,099
offers me a different perspective.

891
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:45,600
God cast you out

892
00:40:45,668 --> 00:40:47,135
because He needed you

893
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:49,638
to do the most difficult of jobs.

894
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:52,507
- It was a gift.
- Gift?

895
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,343
He shunned me.

896
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,610
He vilified me.

897
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:57,879
He made me a torturer!

898
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:01,616
Can you even begin to
fathom what it was like?

899
00:41:01,684 --> 00:41:04,786
Eons spent

900
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:06,521
providing a place for dead mortals

901
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,457
to punish themselves?

902
00:41:08,524 --> 00:41:10,993
I mean, why do they blame me
for all their little failings?

903
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,562
As if I'd spent my days sitting
on their shoulder,

904
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:15,998
forcing them to commit acts they'd
otherwise find repulsive.

905
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:17,265
"Oh, the Devil made me do it."

906
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,235
I have never made any
one of them do anything.

907
00:41:20,303 --> 00:41:21,303
Never.

908
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,872
What happened to you is unfair.

909
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,639
Unfair?

910
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:26,274
This is unjust.

911
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:28,977
For all eternity, my
name will be invoked

912
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:30,812
to represent all their depravity.

913
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,782
That is the gift that my father gave me.

914
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,983
It was an act of love.

915
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:36,084
How do you know?

916
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:38,553
Because you are his
favorite son, Samael.

917
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,522
Do not call me that, please!

918
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,391
You are his fallen angel.

919
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,458
But here's the thing:

920
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,760
When angels fall,

921
00:41:44,827 --> 00:41:47,262
they also... rise.

922
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,497
All you have to do

923
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:51,533
is embrace all that you are.

924
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:53,435
I can't.

925
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:55,103
Yes, you can.

926
00:41:55,171 --> 00:41:57,539
You just have to be
open to the process...

927
00:41:57,607 --> 00:41:59,207
You don't understand.

928
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:00,942
- I can't!
- But why?

929
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,311
Because they stole them from me!

930
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:38,447
Someone's got them, Mazikeen.

931
00:42:44,587 --> 00:42:47,022
Someone's got my wings.

932
