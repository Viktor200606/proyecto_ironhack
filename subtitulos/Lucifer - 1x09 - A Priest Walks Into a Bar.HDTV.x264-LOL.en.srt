00:00:00,699 --> 00:00:01,999
<i>Previously on Lucifer...</i>

2
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:05,608
Thank you for having my
back and for everything.

3
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:09,047
I could have told everyone the truth.

4
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:10,115
You shot me.

5
00:00:10,182 --> 00:00:11,182
Why didn't you?

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,184
'Cause I got big plans for you.

7
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:14,386
You betrayed me, Maze.

8
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:16,896
- Lucifer, I...
- I don't want to hear it.

9
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:18,197
We're done.

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,366
It seems I'm dealing with a bit

11
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:21,233
of a mortality sitch.

12
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,702
I'm bleeding.

13
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,503
I'm just realizing the gravity
of what you're saying.

14
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:26,906
That I'm allergic to lead projectiles?

15
00:00:26,974 --> 00:00:27,974
All I have to do

16
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,842
is wait for some pitiful thug

17
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,444
to end you.

18
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:33,779
And right back to Hell you go.

19
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:35,748
People come to me to ask for
favors, and more often than not,

20
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,450
- I'm happy to oblige.
- What do you get?

21
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:38,651
A devilish I.O.U., if you will.

22
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,752
Who would take a deal like that?

23
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,421
They all do.

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,673
Yeah, fantastic!

25
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:02,141
You're here.

26
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:08,881
Ah, starving! Can't think why!

27
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:10,816
Okay.

28
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:12,284
Thank you.

29
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:13,986
Uh, this should, uh,

30
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:15,621
well, this should just about cover it.

31
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,424
Have a nice evening.

32
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:20,393
Oh, curious.

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,962
In your line of work, how many
times has it happened to you?

34
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,398
You know, like in those
wonderful Internet videos?

35
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,434
Your deliveries ending in sex.

36
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:30,569
Uh...

37
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:31,604
never.

38
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:33,739
Well, that changes tonight.

39
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:34,940
Come!

40
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,443
Come on! Come, come!

41
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,078
Come.

42
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:40,112
I'm still on the clock.

43
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,614
Oh, you'll always be on the clock.

44
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:44,116
But how often will you be here?

45
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:45,851
Hey? Oh, Brittanies!

46
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,053
Brittanies,

47
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,254
- Yeah!
- Pizza delivery guy.

48
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:50,456
Pizza delivery guy, Brittanies.

49
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:52,258
Hi!

50
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,026
Well, go on.

51
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:55,361
What are you waiting for?

52
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:57,496
- Have fun.
- Come on!

53
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,865
Lucifer!

54
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:01,067
Come join us.

55
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,668
Be right there, darlings.

56
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,003
All right.

57
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:11,110
But I didn't

58
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:12,678
join them.

59
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:14,613
Three Brittanies in the Jacuzzi.

60
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:15,948
Three.

61
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,249
Why didn't I join them?

62
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,285
Why do you think you didn't join them?

63
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:21,620
I don't know, Doctor. That's what I pay you

64
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,122
to figure out, isn't it?

65
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,125
Have you ever considered that
all of this excessive partying

66
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:30,134
may be your attempt to fill a void?

67
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:31,144
"Attempt"?

68
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:32,946
I filled five voids last night.

69
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:35,816
That's not what I mean.

70
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:38,919
A void in your emotional life.

71
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,821
You sound...

72
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,824
lonely.

73
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:45,158
"Lonely"?

74
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:47,861
Have... have you been listening
to a word I've said?

75
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,296
I am never alone.

76
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:51,665
I'm constantly surrounded by people.

77
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:53,834
You know? I party whenever I desire.

78
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:54,968
My bed never cold.

79
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:56,837
Lucifer, being alone

80
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:59,707
and being lonely are two
entirely different things.

81
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:00,982
- Are they?
- Yes!

82
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,216
You may be surrounded by others,

83
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:05,219
but do you truly consider
any of those people

84
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:06,955
your friend?

85
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:09,630
My friend?

86
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:10,796
A peer you respect.

87
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:12,744
Someone you like to spend time with.

88
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:15,347
Someone with whom you share
a meaningful connection.

89
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:18,083
Well, you and I connect quite well.

90
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:19,818
I'm talking personal.

91
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:21,987
What about Maze?

92
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,388
No.

93
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:25,090
She and I are on the outs, I'm afraid.

94
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:27,325
Long story filled with betrayal.

95
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,327
You actually make a cameo in it.

96
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:32,364
How about Detective Decker?

97
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:34,833
Do you consider her your friend?

98
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:39,037
Well, quite honestly, I...

99
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm not sure what we are.

100
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:48,080
Lucifer?

101
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:49,548
Listen, can we tal...?

102
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:51,416
I don't have time for traitors.

103
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:52,784
I get you don't want to talk to me.

104
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:55,821
But someone else is here
to see you for a favor.

105
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:57,322
Not in the mood, Maze.

106
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,390
Trust me.

107
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,326
You don't want to miss this one.

108
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:12,671
You wanted to speak with me?

109
00:04:16,342 --> 00:04:18,610
Lucifer Morningstar.

110
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,412
Father Frank Lawrence.

111
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:24,649
A priest walks into a bar.

112
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:26,952
I've heard this one before.
Never seen it, though.

113
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:29,221
At least not here.

114
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:31,089
Padre, how did you

115
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:32,691
of all people find me?

116
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:35,093
Don't let the collar fool you.

117
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:36,761
I have friends from all walks of life.

118
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:38,130
People who tell me

119
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:40,966
you're the man to see
when you run out of options.

120
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:43,235
Ooh, what kind of nasty trouble

121
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:44,769
have you gotten yourself into then?

122
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:46,638
Pinched too much from the collection basket?

123
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:49,441
I'm here about a neighborhood youth center.

124
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,109
Sounds dreadful.

125
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:52,611
It is... When you realize

126
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:55,113
it's being used as a front
for an illegal drug operation.

127
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,248
The center's director,

128
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:59,317
Lenny Arietta, is recruiting kids
from my church to move his product.

129
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:01,920
Ah, so this is about young boys,
of course it is.

130
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:03,788
One in particular.

131
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:06,658
A kid named Connor.

132
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,661
He's had it rough.

133
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:11,062
Lost both his parents at six.

134
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,864
Bounced from home to home, some juvie.

135
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:15,700
But deep down, a good kid.

136
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,068
So, diddling this one, are you?

137
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,839
How about I not dignify that with an answer,

138
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,073
and instead ask my favor?

139
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:23,175
I was wondering when you'd get to it.

140
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:24,209
I want you to talk to Arietta

141
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:26,211
before Connor gets involved.

142
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,947
And why not go to the police?

143
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,549
Got something to hide, do you?

144
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:31,650
They were useless.

145
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:33,151
Couldn't find anything on Arietta.

146
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,719
Why not ask your boss then, hey?

147
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:36,555
The Almighty Himself.

148
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:37,822
I already have.

149
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,090
Oh, no luck?

150
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:40,759
On the contrary,

151
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:42,827
I believe he led me to you.

152
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:44,663
I highly doubt that.

153
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:48,767
So that's it, is it?

154
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:51,770
Stop a drug ring to help
some kid get out of trouble.

155
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:53,405
What's in it for you?

156
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,441
What is it you really want?

157
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:59,311
That dirty dark desire I can

158
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:02,013
see you struggling to hold in.

159
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:05,450
What I really want...

160
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:07,085
Yeah?

161
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:10,722
is to put my fist through Arietta's face.

162
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,957
Ha!

163
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:13,525
And there it is.

164
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,060
Wrath.

165
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:17,195
Ooh, not so high and mighty now, are you?

166
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:19,664
We all have demons inside.

167
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:22,367
My demon tends the bar.

168
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:24,369
So come on, what else are you hiding?

169
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:27,539
Hypocrites like you always have something.

170
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,174
- You don't know anything about me.
- Oh, I know plenty.

171
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:32,911
You and I are natural sworn enemies.

172
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,247
So, you gonna help me or not?

173
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:37,983
My answer to you, Father,

174
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,928
is a big fat no.

175
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,774
Handle it yourself.

176
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,324
You're lucky I don't have any active cases,

177
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:53,226
or else I'd send this to Narcotics.

178
00:06:53,294 --> 00:06:54,427
"Narcotics"? No, no, no, no.

179
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:55,762
I don't give a damn about the drug dealer.

180
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,530
We're here to investigate the priest.

181
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:58,198
Priest?

182
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,351
I thought we were here to
talk to the youth director.

183
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,554
We are. To get dirt on the priest.

184
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,056
He must be hiding something.

185
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:05,572
And what better to way
to stick it to dear old Dad

186
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,274
than prove that those
who speak on His behalf

187
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:09,910
aren't as virtuous as they pretend to be.

188
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:11,378
You thought it'd be a good idea

189
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:12,913
to rope me into your imaginary family feud?

190
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,114
Great.

191
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:16,683
Look, am I mistaken or
do you catch bad guys?

192
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:18,585
Now, this priest is up to something.

193
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:20,787
Something nefarious... I can feel it.

194
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:23,223
Last I checked, your feelings
don't count as probable cause.

195
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,276
Well, isn't the fact that he came to me

196
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,511
probable cause enough?

197
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:27,512
Or I could just interrogate

198
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,180
this youth director by myself.

199
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,516
No, just let me do the talking.

200
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,518
Mr. Arietta?

201
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,386
Hmm.

202
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,054
Well, if I were trapped in here
with these vile children,

203
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,456
I'd lock my door as well.

204
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,669
Detective.

205
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,678
He's dead.

206
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,146
Wow.

207
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,182
Told you the priest was up to something.

209
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:23,757
M.E. puts the time of Arietta's death
between 11:30 and 12:00 this morning.

210
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:26,093
'Cause was multiple hits
with a baseball bat.

211
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,261
There are some abrasions on his face.

212
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:29,863
So it looks like he struggled
before he died.

213
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:31,000
And I found this.

214
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:32,535
Ooh, what's that?

215
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:34,270
It's a voice modulator.
Hey, can you not do that?

216
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:35,839
Detective, I am your father.

217
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,574
It's not a toy, Lucifer.

218
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:38,708
It could be evidence.

219
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:39,742
Well, I'm impressed.

220
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,846
Looks like the priest handled
it himself after all.

221
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:44,547
- We don't know the priest did this.
- Well, maybe you don't.

222
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:45,515
Detective Decker?

223
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,683
Hold on.

224
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,151
Oh, can you take that?

225
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:49,385
Yeah. Thank you.

226
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,292
Hey, you're the head counselor, right?

227
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,660
Uh, yeah.

228
00:08:57,728 --> 00:08:59,062
Um, Eric Doyle.

229
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,263
Any idea who might've done this?

230
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,231
No.

231
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:03,066
I mean, everyone liked Lenny.

232
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,101
He was a good boss.

233
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,836
So, he had no enemies whatsoever, no?

234
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:10,373
Especially any who wear clerical collars?

235
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,408
- So you know about the priest.
- Oh, yes.

236
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,310
Yeah, that guy's always coming around here

237
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:15,745
and getting into arguments with Lenny.

238
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,113
Hmm.

239
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,516
But he's a priest.

240
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,783
Right.

241
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,553
Mr. Doyle, where were you between
11:30 and 12:00 this morning?

242
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,489
Uh... here.

243
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:29,392
In counseling sessions
with, uh, Nikki and Connor.

244
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Connor?

245
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,730
Well, that's the altar boy
from the priest's photo.

246
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,198
So, is it, is it true

247
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:36,599
Mr. Arietta's dead?

248
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,868
Well, duh, dumb-ass.

249
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:41,137
It is. Yeah.

250
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,438
Did you know him well?

251
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:43,339
A little, I guess.

252
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:44,807
He, he, I mean, he ran the place.

253
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,077
Do you know if Mr. Arietta was
involved in any drug activity?

254
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,546
Drugs?

255
00:09:49,613 --> 00:09:50,780
I mean, I wish he was.

256
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,182
That would've made him more interesting.

257
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:53,950
Okay.

258
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,251
Enough about the dead guy.

259
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,720
Tell me everything you know
about Padre Pederast.

260
00:09:57,788 --> 00:09:58,922
Who?

261
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,156
Father Frank.

262
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,357
Did you see him do this?

263
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:03,159
Do you think he's capable?

264
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,595
Father Frank kill Mr. Arietta?

265
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:06,663
Yes.

266
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,031
No. No way.

267
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:09,399
What do you mean "no way"?

268
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,067
The guy's a creeper and
totally obsessed with you.

269
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:12,669
He's just overprotective.

270
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:15,138
Ever since my parents died,

271
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:17,941
he feels like he's got to watch
out for me or something.

272
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,375
But he's a good guy.

273
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:21,010
He's just a little...

274
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,046
just a little annoying.

275
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:24,013
- See?
- Hmm?

276
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,014
Annoying.

277
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,182
Mm-hmm.

278
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,750
When was the last time you saw him?

279
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,586
Uh, he... Here this morning.

280
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:32,021
Yeah, preacher seemed pretty pissed.

281
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,089
Oh.

282
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:34,357
Uh, wait, you don't really think

283
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,892
that, like, Father Frank did this, right?

284
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,427
- 100%.
- Thank you.

285
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:39,862
You've been very helpful.

286
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,863
Right.

287
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,699
See? Told you.

288
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,902
No, I hate to admit it, but
you might be on to something.

289
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,869
Sorry, what was that?

290
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,204
You might be on to something.

291
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:53,876
That's him.

292
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,678
Frank Lawrence.

293
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,847
The most evil of people
have the most normal names,

294
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,415
I've experienced.

295
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,150
Beware anyone named Keith.

296
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:06,256
Well, his criminal
record's pretty extensive.

297
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,157
Assault and battery, disorderly conduct,

298
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:09,892
- drug charges.
- See?

299
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,160
Not very priest-like.

300
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:13,263
But nothing in the past ten years.

301
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,835
Ah, restraining order filed
by Lenny Arietta last week.

302
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:21,004
Ah, well, it's funny how Padre Punchy

303
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,272
failed to mention a restraining order.

304
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:23,706
Please tell me now we have enough

305
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,008
to bring this priest down.

306
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,276
We have enough to bring him in.

307
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:27,677
You ready to go to church?

308
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:29,946
Bringing down a priest is
the only reason I ever would.

309
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:31,481
In. Bring him in.

310
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:33,116
Yes, bring him in so we can bring him down.

311
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,020
Hey, um, you go ahead.

312
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,788
I'll... I'll meet you downstairs.

313
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:41,324
Just something I got to do first.

314
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:53,036
Hey, so I'm in the middle of something,

315
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,570
but I haven't seen you all week.

316
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:56,205
Are we gonna talk about what happened?

317
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,810
What?

318
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:02,278
Our kiss, Dan.

319
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,980
It's kind of a big deal.

320
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:05,581
Right, I'm sorry, Chloe.

321
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:06,983
I've had a lot on my mind.

322
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:08,951
Yeah. You okay?

323
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,952
Yeah, I'm fine.

324
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,988
But we should talk.

325
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:13,456
About everything.

326
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,724
Just not here.

327
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:17,093
Okay, do you want to do dinner
at my place, get takeout?

328
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:19,329
Yeah. Zhang Chow's?

329
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:21,831
Zhang Chow... I was just gonna say that.

330
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:22,932
Yeah, all right.

331
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,467
Sounds good.

332
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,469
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

333
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:37,380
Oh, how's it going, buddy?

334
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:41,017
Malcolm, what are you doing here?

335
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:47,056
Oh, you didn't hear the good news?

336
00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:49,325
Back on duty.

337
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,793
So soon after, um...?

338
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:53,062
What, my partner's suicide?

339
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,700
Yeah, can't let that keep
me down, am I right?

340
00:12:57,768 --> 00:12:58,801
But don't worry.

341
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,236
I already got a new partner.

342
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,905
Yeah, convinced the higher-ups
to give me my first choice.

343
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:04,374
You.

344
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,377
Oh, my God.

345
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:10,646
Seriously, Dan, you got to try this.

346
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,018
What's your game, Malcolm?

347
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,388
Partners? Are you kidding me?

348
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:21,391
Oh, well, what better way to
keep an eye on you, am I right?

349
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,658
I saw you talking to Decker.

350
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:24,093
You want to tell her, don't you?

351
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,664
What, that I'm the one who shot you?

352
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:29,632
Why would I do that?

353
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,667
Your conscience.

354
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,269
I know you, Danny Boy.

355
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:35,438
You forget, this ain't the
first time we've been partners.

356
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:37,173
I looked the other way a few times.

357
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,975
- That didn't make us partners.
- Sure, it did.

358
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,810
Yeah, and it ate away at you

359
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,578
until you finally had enough at Palmetto.

360
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:43,980
I didn't have a choice.

361
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:45,314
No, I-I understand. No, I get it, I get it.

362
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,083
No, you were just protecting
that wife of yours.

363
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:48,584
She saw me, I went for my gun.

364
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:51,090
Boom. No, you took me out
before I could take her out.

365
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,955
No, no hard feelings.

366
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,490
I understand.

367
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:59,195
But... the minute you want to come clean,

368
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:02,899
you and I... we both go to jail.

369
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:04,700
Hmm?

370
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:08,171
I mean, you... you really want
to throw away your marriage?

371
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:11,140
Watch little Trixie grow
up from behind bars?

372
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,408
Think this through, Dan.

373
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:16,145
With you gone, uh, who's
gonna protect Chloe?

374
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:19,048
What do you want from me, Malcolm?

375
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,583
Nothing much.

376
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,053
You're gonna go into evidence
and borrow something for me.

377
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:26,088
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

378
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:49,070
Knock, knock.

379
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,574
Stay here while I look for Father Frank,

380
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,209
- and don't get into any trouble.
- It's a church!

381
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:57,145
What am I gonna do, pray too hard?

382
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,953
Hello.

383
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:07,222
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

384
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,958
It's been three hours
since my last confession.

385
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:11,226
Three hours?

386
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:12,961
Speedy sinner, I like it.

387
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:15,764
No, I just need more guidance.

388
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,702
I'm still having lustful
thoughts about another man.

389
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,003
Splendid.

390
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,972
Who's the lucky fellow?

391
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,776
Um, my husband's limo driver.

392
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,844
What should I do, Father?

393
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:33,815
Well, my dear, uh, you should
embrace your desires.

394
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,617
Really?

395
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,853
Uh, when I was here earlier,
Father Frank told me

396
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,655
I should be faithful to my husband.

397
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,657
Well, I don't know why you're
listening to that fool.

398
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,793
I mean, let's be honest,
if you wanted to be faithful,

399
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,996
then you wouldn't be fantasizing
about your limo driver,

400
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,664
- now, would you, eh?
- You're right.

401
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,132
No, no, no, no, no, don't feel bad.

402
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,901
You have those desires for a reason.

403
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,436
You should act on them.

404
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,838
I mean, you can always come
back here, confess,

405
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,106
and all will be forgiven.

406
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:59,974
Isn't that how this system of yours works?

407
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,610
When you put it that way...

408
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,813
Lucifer, what do you think you're doing?

409
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:10,185
For your penance, ten Bloody
Marys and a good shag.

410
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:22,630
I know you're there.

411
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,700
What, are you watching over me?

412
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,571
Like my own guardian angel.

413
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,174
Yeah.

414
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,577
Grumpy guardian angel.

415
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,112
Forgotten about our deal, Malcolm?

416
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:40,849
Because I brought you back from
the dead for a single purpose.

417
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,753
Yeah, about that, I've...
been meaning to ask.

418
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,588
Why me?

419
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:47,989
- Why you?
- Yeah.

420
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,658
I mean, uh, I must be something special

421
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:52,360
for you to go to all that trouble.

422
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,130
Come on, don't flatter yourself.

423
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:58,366
You're simply in a unique
position to do what I need done.

424
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,369
'Cause I'm a cop.

425
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,872
That, yeah.

426
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,608
Yeah, and because I know you'll do anything

427
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,743
to avoid going back to Hell.

428
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:14,282
Now, stop bothering me with these questions

429
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,950
and just get to the task I've given you.

430
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:18,453
Don't you worry your shiny little head.

431
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,421
I'm already on it, all right?

432
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,423
Everything's going according to plan.

433
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,392
Don't keep me waiting.

434
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:30,765
Patience is not one of my virtues.

435
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,904
I promise you, I... I got this.

436
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,332
Mr. Morningstar, surprised to see you again.

437
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,850
Oh, I wouldn't miss this for the world.

438
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:48,152
Father Frank, when was the
last time you saw Lenny Arietta?

439
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,587
This morning.

440
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:50,892
Despite the restraining order.

441
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,394
I answer to a higher authority.

442
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:54,029
Not today you don't.

443
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:55,988
What happened when you saw him?

444
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:57,556
We exchanged words.

445
00:17:57,624 --> 00:17:59,391
Things got a little heated.

446
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:00,559
What were you fighting about?

447
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:02,694
That altar boy of his, of course.

448
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,696
Why were you fighting over Connor?

449
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:06,899
Because I'm worried that
Arietta's gonna pull Connor

450
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:08,133
into his drug ring.

451
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:09,434
So, what, you give him a right hook?

452
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,437
Sadly, I did.

453
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:14,373
- And then what?
- And then I left.

454
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,508
Ooh, no, no, no, I think
you skipped a part, didn't you?

455
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:18,744
You know, the part where
you beat him to death

456
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:19,745
with a baseball bat?

457
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:22,281
He's dead?

458
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:24,716
Oh, Heavenly Father.

459
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:26,118
Oh, come on.

460
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:27,619
How gullible do you think we are?

461
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:31,990
I had troubles with the man,
but he didn't deserve to die.

462
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:33,692
And I certainly didn't kill him.

463
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,160
Can you account for your whereabouts

464
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:37,062
between 11:30 and 12:00 this morning?

465
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,331
Uh, I was here.

466
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:40,866
Taking confessions.

467
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:43,468
Mrs. Madison had a lot to say,
took up the whole hour.

468
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:46,738
By chance, does Mrs. Madison
have a limo driver?

469
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,941
She does.

470
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:50,275
Damn.

471
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:52,477
Just spoke to his alibi.

472
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:53,745
What?

473
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:54,746
The MILF in confession.

474
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:56,048
Oh, great.

475
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:57,816
Yeah, as much as I'm sure
that followed protocol,

476
00:18:57,884 --> 00:19:00,686
I'm still gonna have to question her myself.

477
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:03,522
Father, I'm gonna need you

478
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,958
to come into the station for a statement.

479
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:09,828
Well, maybe the padre has a twin brother

480
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,897
who also takes confession; that
way he could still be guilty.

481
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,866
Lucifer, seriously, will you just...

482
00:19:15,802 --> 00:19:16,969
Get down!

483
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:35,654
And you wonder why I don't go to church.

484
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,326
I caught a partial from the shooter's plate.

485
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:45,861
Can you run this for me?

486
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,196
- You got it.
- Thank you.

487
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:49,631
So I spoke to Father Frank's alibi.

488
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:51,000
Checks out.

489
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,468
He was in confession with Mrs. Madison

490
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:53,635
from 11:00 to 12:00.

491
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:54,903
He's not our guy.

492
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:56,171
Well, maybe she's lying.

493
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,374
I mean, you know the sort
of people that go to church.

494
00:19:58,441 --> 00:19:59,708
Sinners.

495
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:03,212
Lab results from the voice
modulator came back empty.

496
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,714
No prints, no DNA.

497
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:07,249
What, so you think this shooting

498
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:09,718
and the youth director's
death are connected?

499
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:12,154
We know they have at least
one thing in common.

500
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:15,927
Father, you will be relieved
to know that no one was injured.

501
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:17,896
- Oh, thank God.
- Please don't.

502
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:19,931
You care to tell us what that was about?

503
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,366
The shooting?

504
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:22,834
I don't know.

505
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,604
This wasn't a random attack.

506
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:27,839
They were shooting at you.

507
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:29,107
But you don't seem surprised.

508
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:30,809
What aren't you telling us?

509
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:38,946
Keep your nose out of our business or else.

510
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:41,030
The voice modulator from Arietta's office.

511
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,821
You should have gone
to the police with this.

512
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:46,458
I assumed it was Arietta,
and I'm not afraid of him.

513
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:48,593
But if it's The Spider...

514
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:50,228
Spider?

515
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:51,596
I've heard whispers of another dealer

516
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:52,998
trying to take over Arietta's business.

517
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,033
People call him "The Spider."

518
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:56,735
Scary, violent reputation.

519
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,370
Do you know who this Spider is?

520
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:00,672
I don't.

521
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,074
You're holding something back, Father.
I can tell.

522
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:06,478
Hmm?

523
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:07,746
I have a confession to make.

524
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:09,873
Finally! Well, the truth

525
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:11,986
will set you free... isn't that
what your beloved book says?

526
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:14,603
I lied when I said Connor was
in danger of becoming involved.

527
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:16,625
He already is. Dealing for Arietta.

528
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,759
What, that's it?

529
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:18,861
Oh, please don't tell me

530
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:20,176
that's what you've been
holding back all this time.

531
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:22,464
Wait. If Connor's already in deep,

532
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,732
why go to all this trouble to protect him?

533
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,034
He's had it rough.

534
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:27,736
Thinks he can only rely on himself.

535
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:30,005
He's a good kid, Detective.

536
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:31,907
There's still hope for him.

537
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,743
Father, you were today's target.

538
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,311
We need to worry about your safety first.

539
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,747
Do you have a place to stay?

540
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:39,748
We can offer police protection.

541
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,549
I'm fine right here.

542
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:45,153
This... is my sanctuary.

543
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,255
Well, your sanctuary just got shot

544
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:48,690
to high heaven, Padre.

545
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:51,393
But if you're looking to lay low,

546
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,662
I believe I know just the place.

547
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:13,448
Thought this might make you
feel more at home, you know.

548
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:14,716
Sure you did.

549
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:16,918
Hey.

550
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:19,854
So, partial plates from the shooter's SUV

551
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,022
came back with a couple matches.

552
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,724
But this is interesting, one of them

553
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,859
was recently reported stolen
outside the youth center.

554
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,861
Oh, you think someone inside's responsible.

555
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,596
I think it's too much of
a coincidence not to be,

556
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:30,799
but I ordered traffic cam footage,

557
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:32,467
so hopefully it'll show us who was driving.

558
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:34,035
Hopefully.

559
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,604
Couldn't resist, huh?

560
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:39,207
Well, the man deserves some fun.

561
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,509
Or you still want to prove he's a hypocrite.

562
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:42,844
Well, what can I say?

563
00:22:42,912 --> 00:22:44,813
Temptation's in my nature.

564
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,914
Hmm.

565
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:47,382
And how's that working out for you?

566
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,387
Padre, does this not bother you?

567
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,722
What can I say?

568
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,256
I love this song.

569
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,334
You sure you're gonna
be okay in here, Father?

570
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:08,036
This? Oh, absolutely.

571
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:09,504
I grew up in places like this.

572
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:11,773
Oh, I find that hard to believe.

573
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,241
No one's born a priest.

574
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,843
Before the cloth, I was just

575
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,012
Frank Lawrence, touring musician.

576
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,380
Really?

577
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,215
Let me guess... cowbell.

578
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:21,783
Close. Piano.

579
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:23,485
Good old rock and roll.

580
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:25,620
Opened for Dylan, Bowie, the Stones...

581
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:27,722
- The Rolling Stones?
- Yep.

582
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,624
It was a crazy time, let me tell you.

583
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:30,925
I was a lot like you, really.

584
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,361
That's literally impossible.

585
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:34,996
Thought the fun would never stop.

586
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:38,166
Then, uh...

587
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,370
Father, you don't have to...

588
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:44,172
No, no, no, no. Go on.

589
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:48,977
Car accident.

590
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:50,145
Ten years ago.

591
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:52,414
I was traveling with Connor and his family.

592
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:55,417
Uh, Connor's dad was a drummer,

593
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:57,185
we used to play together.

594
00:23:57,253 --> 00:24:00,088
Another car swerved into our lane and, uh...

595
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:03,124
Connor lost both his parents that night.

596
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:08,696
My daughter was with us, too.

597
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:13,468
She didn't make it, either.

598
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,040
Thought I'd seen some dark days.

599
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:22,310
Nothing compared to losing my little girl.

600
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,578
My heart just...

601
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:26,281
cracked right open.

602
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:27,315
Well, you must have been

603
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,784
awfully angry at your beloved God.

604
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:32,821
I was so... untethered.

605
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,222
Lost.

606
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,890
Turning to Him is what saved me.

607
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,993
So... hold on. God stole your spawn

608
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,563
and then you decided to worship Him?

609
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,964
I can't really explain it,

610
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:44,899
but somehow it made me feel
that she was safe.

611
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:48,703
That's when I discovered my faith.

612
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:51,973
The church gave me purpose.

613
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,676
It was there that I crossed
paths with Connor again.

614
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,679
Me, a parent without a child;

615
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,647
him, a child without a parent.

616
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,152
We might not always understand it,

617
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,588
but God has a plan.

618
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,556
Yes. I know.

619
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:10,859
But why does everybody always
think it's a good plan?

620
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,997
Please excuse me, Father.

621
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,834
So can we just go back to this absurd notion

622
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:21,503
that you and I are in any way similar?

623
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,872
- You're right. We're not.
- Thank you.

624
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,641
I'm probably a much better
piano player than you are.

625
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:50,565
D-Do you know anything that doesn't

626
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,133
make me want to, you know, impale myself?

627
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:53,668
Like, uh...

628
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:55,136
Something more upbeat.

629
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,137
Something a bit, um...

630
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,406
I mean, like, uh...

631
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,710
Oh.

632
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,145
I think I know what you mean.

633
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:07,148
Something like that?

634
00:26:07,216 --> 00:26:08,616
- Yeah.
- Okay.

635
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,560
Father has got soul.

636
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:20,295
You ain't seen nothing yet.

637
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:21,462
- Oh.
- Yeah.

638
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,864
- You like to take the top?
- Why not?

639
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:23,865
Excuse me.

640
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,137
Yah!

641
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:36,911
Hoo!

642
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,148
Oh.

643
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:41,516
Hi.

644
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:42,917
Hi.

645
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:45,019
Yeah, well, I suppose that wasn't

646
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,087
completely terrible.

647
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:47,388
Not completely.

648
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:50,458
Um, sorry to interrupt,

649
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,293
but Father Frank's story
about The Spider checks out,

650
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,262
- and I got a lead.
- O...

651
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,263
So...

652
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:56,564
kay.

653
00:26:56,632 --> 00:26:57,565
Right, well...

654
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:58,700
Well, you stay here.

655
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,468
You need the practice.

656
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:08,610
I talked to Narcotics,
and one of their CI's said

657
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,411
The Spider's rumored to hang out here.

658
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,080
Well, I don't know why
you had to bring me along.

659
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:14,048
What, are you anxious to get
back to your new friend?

660
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:16,117
Please.

661
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:17,318
The Devil friends with a priest?

662
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,286
That's absurd.

663
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:21,522
It's absurdly adorable.

664
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,224
You know, it's okay
to admit you like the guy.

665
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:26,160
He's everything that
I stand against, Detective.

666
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,762
Yeah, well, sometimes we get along best

667
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,397
with the people we're most different from.

668
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:30,498
What?

669
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:33,901
Hey.

670
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:35,470
- Look.
- Oh.

671
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:36,804
Little Miss Sunshine from the youth center.

672
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,473
Yeah, Nikki.

673
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,607
What's that she's doing?

674
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:41,542
Drug deal.

675
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,012
And a smooth one.

676
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,780
Maybe she's The Spider.

677
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:47,649
Ooh, black widow, then. Lovely.

678
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:48,650
Wait.

679
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:51,185
She's giving it to someone else.

680
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,689
To Connor.

681
00:27:57,993 --> 00:27:59,794
Get down!

682
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:01,529
Come on!

683
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,998
Important police work,

684
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:05,333
get on!

685
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:14,142
Gone.

686
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,443
Great.

687
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,345
And why was the black widow
giving her cash to altar boy?

688
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:18,913
You never want to carry

689
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:20,415
drugs and money on you at the same time.

690
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:21,416
Makes you a target.

691
00:28:23,052 --> 00:28:26,287
Or because Connor's The Spider.

692
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:28,289
Traffic cam footage.

693
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:31,893
Ah, from the church shooting.

694
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,928
So the boy the priest was trying to protect

695
00:28:33,996 --> 00:28:35,229
is the one who tried to kill him?

696
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,032
Well, isn't that an
ironic kick in the cassock.

697
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:52,712
This doesn't prove Connor's The Spider.

698
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,847
It's pretty damning, Father.

699
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:56,315
And it's enough for the APB

700
00:28:56,383 --> 00:28:57,984
- that just went out.
- Ah.

701
00:28:58,052 --> 00:28:59,318
Connor's been declared armed and dangerous.

702
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:00,319
Armed and dangerous?

703
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:01,721
The boy needs to be helped,

704
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:03,056
convinced to turn himself in.

705
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,023
Father, he shot at you.

706
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,693
He fired into a room full of kids.

707
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,695
Yes, but he shot up, didn't he?

708
00:29:08,762 --> 00:29:10,897
We'll do everything we can
to bring him in peacefully.

709
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,801
If you'll excuse me, I...

710
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:15,935
need some air.

711
00:29:16,003 --> 00:29:17,737
Uh...

712
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:19,105
I have some digging to do.

713
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:20,840
Will you watch over him until I get back?

714
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:22,862
What? You want me to babysit the priest?

715
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:25,578
I babysit you all the time.

716
00:29:38,592 --> 00:29:40,526
Need a light?

717
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:44,363
No, thanks.

718
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:45,498
Quit years ago.

719
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,533
Still enjoy the ritual, though.

720
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:49,001
Always keep one on me.

721
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:52,672
Please tell me you didn't
come out here to talk to Him.

722
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,640
God?

723
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,142
This is as good a spot as any.

724
00:29:59,012 --> 00:29:59,946
Right.

725
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:02,381
Does He, uh...

726
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:03,649
does He ever talk back?

727
00:30:03,717 --> 00:30:06,419
I don't need to hear Him to... hear Him.

728
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:07,687
If you know what I mean.

729
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:10,223
Well, yes, He never talks to me, either.

730
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,991
Listen, um...

731
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:14,093
sorry about the altar boy.

732
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:15,795
Surely you know you're not to blame.

733
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:18,464
I mean, some people are
just... beyond saving.

734
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:19,732
That's where you're wrong.

735
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,200
There's still hope for him.

736
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:25,138
He shot up your church,

737
00:30:25,205 --> 00:30:27,373
he's most likely running
a drug ring behind your back,

738
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:29,175
and, oh, yes, killed a man.

739
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:30,243
I don't believe that.

740
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,410
Look, what if it's true?

741
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:32,545
Then he needs me even more.

742
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,547
How can you still have faith in this boy?

743
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,949
God has faith in him.

744
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:38,117
In all of us.

745
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:39,385
Even in our darkest moments.

746
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:40,686
Oh, you really believe that.

747
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:42,088
I do.

748
00:30:42,156 --> 00:30:43,623
Why don't you?

749
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:49,061
Because He didn't have faith in me.

750
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:52,632
I felt that way once, too.

751
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:55,368
But now I know, deep in my heart,

752
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:57,470
God has a plan for me.

753
00:30:57,538 --> 00:30:59,372
Oh, His plan for me was quite clear.

754
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:02,041
How do you know it's finished?

755
00:31:11,718 --> 00:31:13,653
Mm.

756
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,424
What?

757
00:31:18,492 --> 00:31:20,827
One of my parishioners, uh,

758
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:22,862
a lot of them are still
upset about the shooting.

759
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,130
Excuse me.

760
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:27,099
Yeah.

761
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:37,009
There.

762
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:39,478
I got what you wanted from evidence.

763
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:45,585
Are we done?

764
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:48,988
Not by a long shot.

765
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:50,656
Partner.

766
00:31:57,798 --> 00:31:58,731
Hey.

767
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,967
Did you leave Father Frank upstairs?

768
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:02,134
No, he took a call.

769
00:32:02,202 --> 00:32:04,136
I presumed he came down here.

770
00:32:04,204 --> 00:32:05,705
Why would he do that?

771
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:14,580
Maze, the priest, have you seen him?

772
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:16,148
So you're talking to me now?

773
00:32:16,216 --> 00:32:18,885
Have you seen him?!

774
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:21,520
He was down here on his phone.

775
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:22,955
Heard him talking to someone named Connor.

776
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:24,357
- He left to go meet him.
- He left?

777
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:25,558
Where to?

778
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:30,963
Maybe he's trying to convince
Connor to turn himself in.

779
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:33,399
No. He's probably trying
to hide the little miscreant.

780
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:35,368
Put his faith in God, not the police.

781
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:37,803
Why do you care about a priest?

782
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:39,338
I don't.

783
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:40,539
Where would he hide him?

784
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:43,809
Somewhere he considers safe, I assume.

785
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:45,544
Sanctuary.

786
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,327
You don't want to do this.

787
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,229
- I know you. This isn't you.
- Sorry,

788
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:04,615
I don't have a choice, okay?

789
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,849
- I have to do this.
- I get it.

790
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:07,673
You don't think you can rely on anyone else

791
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:09,800
to survive... but you're not alone.

792
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:11,455
I'm here for you, whenever you need me.

793
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:13,806
I don't need you! Okay?

794
00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:15,908
I don't need anybody!

795
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:17,777
Go on, then, shoot the altar boy.

796
00:33:17,844 --> 00:33:19,845
- Shh.
- In the leg or something, obviously.

797
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:21,647
Just do it, Connor.

798
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:23,549
Pull the damn trigger already.

799
00:33:23,617 --> 00:33:24,917
That's Eric Doyle.

800
00:33:24,985 --> 00:33:25,885
The counselor.

801
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:27,954
That's our Spider.

802
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:34,160
You know, Nikki... I trust.

803
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:35,261
But you?

804
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:37,096
I think you're too
attached to this preacher.

805
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:39,031
You're gonna have to show me

806
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:40,333
that you're not.

807
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,467
No shot from here.

808
00:33:41,535 --> 00:33:42,868
I know you, Connor.

809
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:43,936
That drive-by,

810
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:45,571
you intentionally missed me, didn't you?

811
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:46,772
Stop talking. Please.

812
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,174
Make him stop talking.

813
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:49,775
- It's really easy.
- You couldn't do it then,

814
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:51,510
and you don't want to do it now.

815
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:52,578
God's giving you

816
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:54,647
a second chance right here.

817
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:56,148
E-Enough with the sermon, preacher!

818
00:33:56,216 --> 00:33:58,584
Connor, just shoot
this son of a bitch already.

819
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:00,519
Just follow your heart, son.

820
00:34:00,587 --> 00:34:02,121
I have faith in you.

821
00:34:10,197 --> 00:34:12,498
I can't do it, Doyle. I'm sorry.

822
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:13,699
I'm sorry, too, kid.

823
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:15,701
I can't allow weakness,

824
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:17,970
not when I've just taken control.

825
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:18,804
No!

826
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:23,642
Father!

827
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:29,549
Hands up. Get down on the ground.

828
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:31,985
No, no, no, you idiot!

829
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:39,892
The bloody hell were you thinking?

830
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:41,790
This is Unit 831 at St. Morgan's Church.

831
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,083
We need two ambos, code 4.

832
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:44,769
Don't go anywhere, you moron!

833
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,651
It's okay. I'm not afraid of dying.

834
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:50,741
Well, you should be. It's really
boring where you're headed.

835
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:53,577
I hope so. I've had enough
excitement for one life.

836
00:34:53,644 --> 00:34:55,112
Stop talking like that.

837
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,981
You've got more to do here.
You've got more people to annoy.

838
00:34:58,049 --> 00:34:59,049
Pressure on the wound.

839
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:00,217
I am!

840
00:35:00,284 --> 00:35:02,719
Just come on, Frank,
stay with me, stay with me.

841
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:06,790
Oh, uh... at first...

842
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:10,494
I didn't understand why
God put you in my path.

843
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:13,296
But then it hit me.

844
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:16,466
Maybe... He put me in yours.

845
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:18,235
I... highly doubt it.

846
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:20,103
He gave up on me a long time ago.

847
00:35:20,171 --> 00:35:23,373
You're wrong, Lucifer.

848
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:25,876
Remember...

849
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:27,511
your father...

850
00:35:27,578 --> 00:35:29,946
has-has a plan.

851
00:35:30,014 --> 00:35:31,615
My father?

852
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:33,083
Yeah.

853
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:35,052
You know?

854
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,354
Frank?

855
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:40,490
Frank!

856
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:43,960
Frank.

857
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,370
Time to pull the legs

858
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:54,738
off The Spider.

859
00:35:56,908 --> 00:35:58,008
Lucifer...

860
00:35:58,709 --> 00:35:59,643
Lucifer, stop!

861
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:02,979
Why did you do this?

862
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:04,181
- I don't know, man.
- Why?!

863
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:05,582
He was bringing too much heat!

864
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,584
Why?! Why...?!

865
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:11,060
Lucifer, stop. Father Frank

866
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,395
wouldn't want this.

867
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:18,367
Stop.

868
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:49,131
Connor gave us everything.

869
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,199
The drug front.

870
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,134
How Doyle took on "The Spider" name

871
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:54,103
and killed Arietta to
take over the business.

872
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,204
With Connor's cooperation,

873
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,439
he won't do much juvie, if any at all.

874
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,775
Maybe Father Frank was right.

875
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,178
Maybe there's hope for him yet.

876
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,182
You okay?

877
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,186
I'm fine.

878
00:37:10,253 --> 00:37:11,987
Good night, Detective.

879
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:39,215
You...

880
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:42,451
you cruel, manipulative bastard!

881
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:45,221
Was this all part of Your plan?

882
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:49,024
It's all just a game to You, isn't it?

883
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:51,193
Eh?

884
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:53,996
Well, I know punishment,

885
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:56,665
and he did not deserve that.

886
00:37:57,534 --> 00:38:00,102
He followed Your stupid rules

887
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,271
and it still wasn't good enough!

888
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,840
So what does it take to please You?

889
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,442
Break Your rules and you fall!

890
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:08,410
Follow them and you still lose?!

891
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:10,880
Doesn't matter whether you're a sinner!

892
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:13,649
Doesn't matter whether you're a saint!

893
00:38:13,717 --> 00:38:16,785
Nobody can win, so what's the point?

894
00:38:16,853 --> 00:38:19,655
What's the bloody point?

895
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,866
Dan, I know I wanted to talk, but, um...

896
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,468
my mind, it's just...

897
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:33,736
Somewhere else?

898
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:36,171
Yeah.

899
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,173
Yeah, mine, too.

900
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,178
Can we do this another time?

901
00:38:43,246 --> 00:38:44,980
Yeah.

902
00:38:45,048 --> 00:38:47,049
No problem.

903
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:16,679
Hi.

904
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:23,919
Bit late for a new case, isn't it?

905
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,488
I'm not here for a case.

906
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:28,624
I'm here for you.

907
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:30,059
Oh.

908
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:32,361
Really?

909
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:33,796
Yeah.

910
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:36,332
Thought you could use a friend.

911
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,344
Do you play?

912
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:49,411
Mm.

913
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:51,680
- No. No, I don't.
- Come on,

914
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:53,148
- you must know something.
- No.

915
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:54,917
Uh...

916
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,820
All right, well...

917
00:39:57,887 --> 00:39:59,455
let me see.

918
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,758
- I had three years of lessons...
- Mm.

919
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:05,894
and this is all I remember.

920
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,500
Surely, you must be joking.

921
00:40:16,973 --> 00:40:18,273
All right.

922
00:40:41,798 --> 00:40:42,965
Mm.

923
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:45,134
Ah...

924
00:40:46,002 --> 00:40:47,603
Mmm.

925
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,741
Enjoying the life I gave you?

926
00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:55,844
Hey...

927
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,780
did food taste this good before I died?

928
00:40:57,847 --> 00:40:59,915
'Cause I don't remember it
being this friggin' delicious.

929
00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:03,318
I don't care what you're doing
with your new life, Malcolm...

930
00:41:03,386 --> 00:41:05,721
except for what I've asked of you.

931
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:07,623
What's taking so long?

932
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,825
Come on, come on, chill out, Amenadude.

933
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:12,027
Here, have some waffles.

934
00:41:14,364 --> 00:41:16,532
Do you want to go back?

935
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,168
Do you... want...

936
00:41:19,235 --> 00:41:20,402
to go back?

937
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,938
Because I can make that happen.

938
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:24,440
Yeah.

939
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:26,775
You're remembering it now, aren't you?

940
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:27,976
I bet

941
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:32,081
your 30 seconds in Hell felt like 30 years.

942
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:33,649
Imagine what eternity

943
00:41:33,716 --> 00:41:35,717
- would feel like.
- I'm sorry.

944
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,120
Okay?

945
00:41:38,188 --> 00:41:39,588
Sorry.

946
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:44,426
Look...

947
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:46,728
I got it.

948
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,931
An untraceable gun.

949
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:51,333
It won't come back to me.

950
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,974
I'm ready now.

951
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,677
So...

952
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:03,745
tell me...

953
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,415
who do you want me to kill?

954
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,418
His name...

955
00:42:10,753 --> 00:42:13,322
is Lucifer Morningstar.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
