1
00:00:01,257 --> 00:00:03,393
Are you from the <i>Star Wars</i> universe?

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,589
- Were you in the original trilogy?
- Yes.

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,818
Is there a picture of you
in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?

4
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,675
God, I hope not.

5
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:16,724
And no, I'm not Princess Leia.

6
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:18,093
Okay. My turn.

7
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:20,645
Are you in all six <i>Star Wars</i> movies?

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,229
- Yes.
- Interesting.

9
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,630
Are you a droid?

10
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,459
Do you kind of look like
a shiny Sheldon?

11
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:33,034
- C-3PO.
- You got it.

12
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,958
That's preposterous.

13
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,981
I do not resemble C-3PO.

14
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:41,831
Don't get me wrong.
I'm flattered. I just don't see it.

15
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:48,377
Leslie Winkle.

16
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:51,573
You've reached
"Friends with Benefits."

17
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,533
For a booty call, press one now.

18
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,684
What exactly does
that expression mean,

19
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,350
"friends with benefits"?

20
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:04,125
Does he provide her
with health insurance?

21
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,349
Imagine you maintained a friendship
with someone you had sex with,

22
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:13,197
but you were free to date
whoever you wanted.

23
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:16,701
I'm sorry.
I can't imagine any of that.

24
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,955
- All right. Back to the game.
- I believe it's my turn.

25
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,374
You may begin your questions
whenever you're ready.

26
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,734
Are you Spock?

27
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,106
I don't like this game.

28
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:34,468
So, where were we?

29
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,482
Aren't you leaving
for your booty call?

30
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:38,045
No, it was something else.

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,953
Why does everything have to be
about sex with you? Come on.

32
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:42,142
Whose turn is it?

33
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,689
- We were up to you.
- Great. Just start.

34
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,649
Let's see. Are you from a TV series?

35
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,017
She dumped me!

36
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:57,032
I bet he's someone from <i>Babylon 5</i>.
We're never going to get it.

37
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:19,632
Subtitles: The FWT Team

38
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,600
What happened?
Why did she dump you?

39
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:26,799
I don't know. She just said,
"Howard, Mama's a rolling stone."

40
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:32,836
Then her call waiting beeped
and she was gone.

41
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:36,554
I don't understand.

42
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:39,329
If you were
in a non-emotional relationship,

43
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:43,158
then why are you having what appears
to be an emotional response?

44
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,581
He obviously had feelings for her.

45
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,850
Of course I had feelings for her.
I saw her naked, for God's sake.

46
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:53,506
Okay, you just need
to get your mind off it.

47
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,576
Do you want to go
to the comic book store?

48
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:58,636
- Maybe go see a movie?
- I don't want to go anywhere.

49
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:00,202
You know,

50
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:04,151
I'm given to understand
that there's an entire city in Nevada

51
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:08,212
designed specifically to help people
like Howard forget their problems.

52
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,566
They can replace them
with new problems,

53
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,112
such as alcoholism, gambling addiction,
and sexually transmitted diseases.

54
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:22,329
Is it me, or was that
Sheldon's way of saying, "Vegas, baby!"?

55
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:27,498
- I've never been there. Have you?
- Me? No.

56
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,593
I just got "Vegas, baby!"
from Vince Vaughn in <i>Swingers</i>.

57
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,990
It could be fun.
My weekend's wide open, now that...

58
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:42,269
Okay, let's do this.
Let's go to Las Vegas.

59
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:43,836
Now? Right now?

60
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,316
Why not? People do things "right now,"
all the time.

61
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:48,415
Why can't we be
"right now" people, too?

62
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,740
Go home, pack a bag,
and we'll be "right now" people.

63
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:54,217
I have to stop at the drug store
to refill a prescription,

64
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:56,515
but after that, we'll go right now.

65
00:03:57,392 --> 00:03:58,953
What do you say, Howard?

66
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:00,078
I say...

67
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:01,566
"Vegas, baby!"

68
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:06,064
- What are you gonna tell your mother?
- "Sea World, baby!"

69
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:13,880
- Are you coming?
- I'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs

70
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,455
and hatch larvae
in my auditory canal.

71
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:21,010
Great.
We'll bring you back a t-shirt.

72
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,015
Thank you.

73
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:28,912
Hello, neighbor.

74
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,352
Hello, Sheldon.

75
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:33,606
And how are you this fine evening?

76
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:36,121
- Great.
- Good. I'm glad.

77
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:38,597
Really?
Are you drunk?

78
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,313
I'm just in a good mood.

79
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:43,691
While my compatriots
are in Las Vegas,

80
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:47,720
I will be enjoying a blissful evening
in my personal Fortress of Solitude.

81
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:50,968
That's Superman's
big ice thingy, right?

82
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,511
You know, I'm in such a good mood,

83
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:56,273
I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp
of the English language

84
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:58,181
folksy and charming today.

85
00:05:00,857 --> 00:05:02,357
What smells so good?

86
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:06,006
That is the intoxicating
aroma of Kadhai Paneer,

87
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:09,679
a perfect culinary representation
of the freedom this evening holds.

88
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:13,118
Not only is it Indian cuisine,
which Koothrappali loathes,

89
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:15,181
it contains
a generous helping of peanuts,

90
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:18,734
which would reduce Wolowitz
to a wheezing 97-pound blister.

91
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,554
And finally,
its main ingredient is paneer,

92
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,068
a farmer's cheese

93
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:28,980
that would cause Leonard to render
any room uninhabitable within minutes.

94
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:33,231
Yum.

95
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:36,725
Well, enjoy your big evening.

96
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,460
I realize you're also
on your own tonight,

97
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:43,401
so if, at some point, you find
yourself with nothing to do,

98
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,260
please do not disturb me.

99
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:48,097
Have fun, Sheldon.

100
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:49,416
I shall.

101
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:08,450
What's wrong, Superman?
Locked out of your big ice thingy?

102
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:20,586
Look at this.
Mouthwash, lotion, body wash.

103
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:24,310
Shampoo and conditioner
together in one tiny bottle.

104
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,760
I love Las Vegas.

105
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,388
Howard, could I borrow
some aftershave?

106
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,141
Black case, top compartment.

107
00:06:38,393 --> 00:06:40,087
That's a lot of cologne.

108
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:42,943
First row are your musks.
Second is woods,

109
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,887
leathers and botanicals.

110
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:47,727
Third is assorted pheromones.
Tread lightly.

111
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,790
That's the spirit, Howard.

112
00:06:58,173 --> 00:06:59,444
Yes, we can.

113
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:04,236
Let's go.

114
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:07,561
You guys go ahead.
I just have to finish up an email.

115
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:11,072
That's not an email.
That's Leslie's Facebook page.

116
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,055
Okay, fine.

117
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:14,665
I'm checking her Facebook page.
Look at her status update.

118
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,394
She's saying she dumped me.
People need to know I dumped her.

119
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:19,938
But she did dump you.

120
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:24,686
Grow up, Raj. There's no place
for truth on the Internet.

121
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:29,402
Just go.
I'll catch up with you.

122
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,865
All right.

123
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:34,328
We should have a plan
in case one of us gets lucky.

124
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:39,725
Okay, if I get lucky,

125
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,212
I'll take her to my stately manor
outside Gotham City, and...

126
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:46,685
if you get lucky,
I'll sleep on the moon.

127
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:49,747
Sounds like a plan.

128
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:54,723
Hang on. I think the emergency key
is around here somewhere.

129
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:56,544
We have a bowl.

130
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:59,197
Our keys go in a bowl.

131
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:01,862
You should get a bowl.

132
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,918
So, how did the beautiful mind
of Sheldon Cooper

133
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:06,652
forget his key in the first place?

134
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,571
I left them in the bowl.

135
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,117
I just remembered
where the emergency key is.

136
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:15,244
Where?
In your apartment.

137
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:18,341
- What's it doing in my apartment?
- I went in there a few weeks ago

138
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,457
and you guys weren't
home and I forgot it there.

139
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:23,907
You went in my... Why would...
What are you saying?

140
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,754
It's not a big deal. I was making coffee
and I ran out of milk.

141
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,611
You're the milk thief!

142
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,728
Leonard said I was crazy,
but I knew that carton felt lighter.

143
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,441
All right. Just calm down.

144
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:40,203
I will call the building manager
and he'll come open your door.

145
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:42,076
Eat your dinner here
while you're waiting.

146
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,828
Eat? My dinner?
In your apartment?

147
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,395
Why not?

148
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,291
Sure. Why not?

149
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:51,214
And after the sun's down,
we can all pile in my pickup

150
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,449
and go skinny-dipping
down at the creek.

151
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,160
'Cause today's the day
to stop making sense.

152
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:01,727
Thanks.

153
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:03,952
I'm telling you, Leonard...
video slots...

154
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:07,116
free drinks brought to us
by a bosomy barmaid

155
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:09,673
and all you can eat shrimp
for $3.95.

156
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:13,258
Disneyland can suck it.

157
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,397
This is the real
happiest place on earth.

158
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,780
Dude, check it out!
That's laundry for a month!

159
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:29,522
Hi.

160
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:37,383
Hello.

161
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:42,234
- What's your name?
- Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

162
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,167
Hello, Rajesh Ra...

163
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,069
Hi, Rajesh.

164
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:50,422
- I'm Michaela.
- Hello, Michaela.

165
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:53,008
So, you interested
in a little party?

166
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,329
Why, yes, I love to party.

167
00:09:57,283 --> 00:09:58,907
Party is my middle name.

168
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,482
Or, it would be
if it weren't Ramayan.

169
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:06,326
- Can I talk to you for a moment?
- Not now.

170
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,231
Michaela's inviting me to a party.

171
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:12,027
You better call the moon
and make sure they have a bed for you.

172
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,157
Yeah. I really need to talk to you.

173
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:20,762
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere. Don't move.

174
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:24,682
Just stay the beautiful, unspoiled
American flower that you are.

175
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:29,795
What's wrong with you, dude?
That woman was all up in my jammy.

176
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,325
Okay, I hate to break this to you
and whatever your "jammy" is, but...

177
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:36,885
I'm pretty sure she's a prostitute.

178
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:38,856
What?

179
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,848
Let me put it this way:
In your entire life,

180
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:47,368
how many gorgeous women
have walked straight up to you in a bar

181
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:49,457
and asked if you wanted to party?

182
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,318
Maybe I can save her.

183
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:59,971
Maybe, but I'm guessing it'll cost you
about $500 an hour to try.

184
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,785
It was lovely meeting you.
Best of luck in your future endeavors.

185
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,827
Whatever.

186
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,574
I miss her already.

187
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,660
Howard's losing it.

188
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:23,662
Check out his latest Twitters.

189
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:27,291
"I'm at the bottom of a black hole
staring into the abyss.

190
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:30,684
"My life is meaningless.
My future is without hope."

191
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,984
Why don't we take him
to see the Blue Man Group?

192
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:35,985
You think that'd help?

193
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,398
<i>USA Today</i> calls them
"exuberant fun for the whole family."

194
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:43,744
I don't know, Howard isn't really
the family fun kind of guy.

195
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,830
It's too bad he wasn't here
for that hooker.

196
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,750
She's exactly his type; a hooker.

197
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,297
You know, I bet if we hired her,
that would cheer him up.

198
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:57,996
We're not gonna get
Wolowitz a hooker.

199
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:04,407
"I'm so lonely and horny,

200
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:08,309
"I may open this $20 jar
of peanuts and end it all."

201
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:16,356
I suppose it wouldn't hurt
to get an estimate.

202
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,762
So how was your day?

203
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:27,415
Are you trying to make small talk?

204
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:29,706
Sweetie, you really don't have to.

205
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,208
No, it's the accepted convention.

206
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:36,728
How was your day?

207
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:41,344
They shifted my schedule around
at the restaurant,

208
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,387
- so my hours are gonna be...
- I'm sorry.

209
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,888
That's not going to interest me at all.
Just eat.

210
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,310
Hello again.

211
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,684
Hi. Listen...

212
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:03,739
If you're not busy,
we were thinking maybe you could...

213
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:07,871
- We were wondering...
- If you're really a prostitute.

214
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,248
- You guys cops?
- No.

215
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,712
I'm a prostitute.

216
00:13:14,116 --> 00:13:15,574
Okay, great.

217
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,773
The thing is, we've got this friend,
and he's kind of down in the dumps.

218
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:31,417
And we thought maybe you
could cheer him up.

219
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:32,712
With sex.

220
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:36,856
I think she knows what I meant.

221
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,749
How when you beat around the bush?
She's from the mean streets

222
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:42,270
where they shoot from the hip
and keep it real.

223
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,575
Don't worry.
I can take good care of your friend.

224
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,524
Okay, terrific.

225
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:52,447
Listen, is there
a way that we can do this

226
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:55,985
where he doesn't know
that you're a, you know...

227
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,185
Prostitute.

228
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:00,464
You want the girlfriend experience.

229
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:04,113
Yes. Yeah, exactly.
The girlfriend experience.

230
00:14:04,238 --> 00:14:06,001
Actually,
if it's not too much to ask,

231
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:08,762
could we have the Jewish
girlfriend experience?

232
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:14,144
Okay, that's question 20.
You have to guess.

233
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:17,991
I don't know, Sheldon.

234
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,875
Are you <i>Star Wars</i>?

235
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,561
How can one person be a whole movie?

236
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:27,783
I give up.
Can we just do something else?

237
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,776
Fine.

238
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,386
I was Spock.

239
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:39,377
Are you and Leonard
friends with benefits?

240
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:41,226
What?

241
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,590
Are you and Leonard
friends with benefits?

242
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:46,217
Where did that even come from?
Did he say we were?

243
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,925
No, Leonard said nothing.
But who knows what goes on over here

244
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,359
when he pretends
your mail was misdelivered?

245
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:54,935
Just mail, no benefits.

246
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:56,697
I see.

247
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,708
Why are you asking?

248
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:01,797
I'm curious about the
whole social construct.

249
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,060
On its face, the idea
of satisfying one's sexual appetite,

250
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,864
assuming one is afflicted with such,

251
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:11,078
without emotional entanglement,

252
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,739
that seems eminently practical.

253
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:14,423
What I've observed, however,

254
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:17,683
is Howard Wolowitz
crying like a little girl.

255
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:22,211
Some people just can't handle
that kind of relationship.

256
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,222
Can you?

257
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,090
Excuse me?

258
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:30,336
Are you able to have sex with men

259
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,305
without developing
an emotional attachment?

260
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,811
I really... don't want
to talk about this with you.

261
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:40,008
Is this conversation making you
uncomfortable?

262
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,607
Of course it's making me uncomfortable.
Can't you tell?

263
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:44,192
I really have no idea.

264
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,112
I don't particularly excel
at reading facial expressions...

265
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,024
I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!

266
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,172
Thank you. That's very helpful.

267
00:15:56,215 --> 00:15:58,790
All right, where are
these amazing shrimp?

268
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,666
Behold.

269
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:06,370
Seriously, you think this is
the size of a baby's arm?

270
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:09,086
A little baby.

271
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:12,095
I'm going back to the room.

272
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,790
Boy, would it maybe kill them
to put out a nice brisket?

273
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:29,261
Hi, there. Howard Wolowitz.

274
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,080
Esther Rosenblatt.

275
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:42,018
I don't think the manager's
coming tonight, so here.

276
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:45,314
Are you suggesting
I sleep on the couch?

277
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:48,458
It wasn't the first suggestion
that came to mind,

278
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,592
but it's the one I'm going with.

279
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,095
I can't sleep on your couch.
I sleep in a bed.

280
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,681
And given its dimensions, I have
no intention of living out Snickering's

281
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,810
beloved children's book,
<i>The Tall Man From Cornwall</i>.

282
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:03,251
What?

283
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:06,118
"There was a tall man from Cornwall

284
00:17:06,243 --> 00:17:07,930
"whose length exceed his bed.

285
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:09,987
"My body fits on it,
but barely upon it,

286
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,567
"there's no room
for my big Cornish head."

287
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,707
All right, I will give you my bed
on one condition:

288
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:26,461
that you promise to zip your hole
for the next eight hours.

289
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:29,129
May I say one last thing?

290
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,673
Only if it doesn't rhyme.

291
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:33,983
All right.

292
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:39,646
Good night.

293
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,599
Turn-ons? Let me see.

294
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:48,358
Reading a good book
in front of the fire,

295
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,415
long walks on the beach...

296
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:54,417
and getting freaky on the Sabbath
with a bacon cheeseburger.

297
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,053
Really? Me, too!

298
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,680
<i>Oy, gevalt</i>, you're hot.

299
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:10,856
Excuse me for a moment.

300
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:15,884
How's it going?

301
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,220
Cut the crap.
You set this up, didn't you?

302
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,808
She's a hooker, isn't she?

303
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,211
A prostitute, yes.

304
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:28,026
You already gave her the money?

305
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:31,047
Thank you!

306
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:43,467
What?

307
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:45,867
I can't sleep.

308
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,847
Maybe that's because your hole
is still open.

309
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:53,336
I'm homesick.

310
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,887
Your home is 20 feet from here.

311
00:18:58,443 --> 00:19:00,916
20 feet, 20 light-years,
it doesn't matter.

312
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,906
It's in a galaxy far, far away.

313
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:07,238
Damn it.

314
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,814
What do you want me to do?

315
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,503
Sing <i>Soft Kitty</i>.

316
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,492
That's only for when you're sick.

317
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:24,130
Homesick is a type of being sick.

318
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,285
Come on, do I really have to?

319
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:33,296
I suppose we can stay up and talk.

320
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:37,356
<i>Soft kitty</i>

321
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,747
<i>Warm kitty</i>

322
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:42,173
<i>Little ball of fur</i>

323
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:44,730
<i>Happy kitty</i>

324
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:49,916
- Sleepy kitty.
- <i>Sleepy kit...</i>

325
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,916
Start over.

326
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,073
<i>Soft kitty</i>

327
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:02,587
<i>Warm kitty</i>

328
00:20:02,712 --> 00:20:05,061
<i>Little ball of fur</i>

329
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,450
<i>Happy kitty</i>

330
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:08,957
<i>Sleepy kitty</i>

331
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,609
<i>Purr, purr, purr</i>

332
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:19,259
Thank you for letting me stay here.

333
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:22,303
You're welcome, sweetie.

334
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:28,799
Okay, I'm sleepy now.
Get out.

335
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,855
Good. You're finally home.

336
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:42,656
What were you doing at Penny's?

337
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,587
Well, we had dinner,

338
00:20:44,712 --> 00:20:46,786
played some games,
and then I spent the night.

339
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:50,385
You'll be happy to know
that I now have

340
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,167
a much better understanding
of "friends with benefits."
