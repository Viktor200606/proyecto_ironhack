00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:02,388
- Previously on Lucifer...
- Hey, Lieutenant,

2
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:03,326
are you going somewhere?

3
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,680
I put in for a transfer.

4
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:05,949
Maybe you don't have to go.

5
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,414
As a thank you for watching Trixie,

6
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:09,192
maybe we can go grab
that coffee sometime.

7
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:10,959
Dinner would be more romantic.

8
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:16,369
Did you know that Linda
and Amenadiel are a thing?

9
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,040
So our old flames are having a fling.

10
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,642
I don't care, why should you?

11
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:22,581
Unless you're still hot for angel.

12
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:24,519
No!

13
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,656
You know, for an immortal,

14
00:00:26,657 --> 00:00:28,527
you really do bleed a lot, don't you?

15
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,323
I'm still human. I still feel

16
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:32,187
all the pain that comes with death.

17
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,434
It's just the wounds heal.

18
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:35,114
Do your thing. Ask me.

19
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:36,443
Kane.

20
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:38,390
What is it that you desire?

21
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:39,453
To die.

22
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,254
I will find a way to
end your infinite misery

23
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:43,859
if it's the last thing I do.

24
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:51,708
Lucifer?

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,379
Lucifer!

26
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,120
Hello, Lucifer?

27
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:08,426
If it were that easy to kill me,

28
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:10,039
I would have been dead a long time ago.

29
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:14,887
Very well.

30
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:17,993
Right, have you tried...

31
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,930
- grenade down the throat?
- Yes.

32
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:22,528
- Acid bath?
- Mm-hmm.

33
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:25,307
- Devoured by wolves?
- Yes.

34
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:27,378
- Dropped into helicopter blades?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,682
I've been trying to kill myself

36
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:31,019
since the Bronze Age.

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,621
I have tried

38
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:34,125
everything.

39
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:35,594
Even jumped into a volcano once.

40
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,542
What, you survived molten lava?

41
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:40,664
Yeah, it was a rough six months.
Just, whatever I do, I just...

42
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,354
regrow.

43
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:45,512
Huh, like a blue-eyed,
square-jawed tapeworm.

44
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,653
So if I cut you exactly in
half, would there be two Pierces?

45
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:51,125
No. Only one side would heal.

46
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:53,523
You see, I call it the, the
"master molecule" theory.

47
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:55,188
Yes, yes, Wolverine rules. I get it.

48
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,359
But...

49
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:58,359
there must be some method that works.

50
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:01,432
Lucifer, why do you
care so much about this?

51
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:04,390
Because my Father laid a
curse on you to live forever,

52
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:07,799
so killing you would be an epic
loogie in the old man's eye.

53
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:09,003
Well, you are the Devil.

54
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,573
You must have something shockingly evil

55
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:11,744
up your sleeve.

56
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:13,883
Mm, you mean, uh...

57
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:16,455
- something like this?
- Aah!

58
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,093
Ouch!

59
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,283
Thanks.

60
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:20,554
You're most welcome.

61
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:24,625
'Cause that little bad boy was
forged in the bowels of Hell.

62
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:31,139
Oh, yes, demon steel.

63
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,743
Can kill even me, so...

64
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:36,952
time to say good-bye
to Hollywood, Pierce.

65
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:41,059
Good-bye, Lucifer.

66
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,563
No, I-I don't understand.
How does this not work?

67
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,984
I should have known

68
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:47,071
that you wouldn't be
able to figure this out.

69
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:48,671
Well, I mean, the good news is

70
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:50,734
we've got all the time
in the world to do so.

71
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,717
For me, that's a bad thing.

72
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:08,523
Hey, Dan.

73
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:10,050
- Hey.
- Thank you.

74
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:13,617
I feel like I'm having déjÃ 
vu. This street seems so familiar.

75
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,648
Yeah, well, it should.

76
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,425
We took a look at that house
right there on the corner.

77
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:18,085
Remember? Right after Trixie was born.

78
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:22,007
Oh, yeah. Great public schools,
really safe neighborhood.

79
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:25,213
Oh... or not.

80
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:26,843
June Lee, 34.

81
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:29,139
Local chemistry teacher. She
lived right down the block.

82
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,312
Forestry service left the
wood chipper here overnight,

83
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:33,659
and someone took advantage.

84
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:37,906
Did you get a chance to talk
to any of the lookie-loos yet?

85
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,008
Nope.

86
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,043
All yours.

87
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:41,406
Okay.

88
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:43,125
Hello.

89
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:44,307
I'm Detective Decker.

90
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,335
Who would do this to poor June?

91
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:49,390
Well, I'm hoping that you
all could help me with that.

92
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:51,566
Um... did any of you hear

93
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:54,323
or see anything out of
the ordinary this morning?

94
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:57,778
No. I mean, I heard that
wood chipper going, but...

95
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,914
I didn't know.

96
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:00,398
And did any of you know anyone

97
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:01,719
that would want to hurt June?

98
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,989
No.

99
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,312
Everyone really loved her.

100
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:07,664
She was very active in the community.

101
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:10,640
We just got mani-pedis together.

102
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,414
Mm, sorry.

103
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:20,706
Ah, thank you for your help, Maze.

104
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,994
No worries.

105
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,031
This actually gives
me time to brainstorm

106
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:25,600
a little problem of my own.

107
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,435
Ah.

108
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:29,234
So, this is for anything with wings.

109
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:31,187
- Ooh.
- I grab them like this.

110
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,850
And then I stab 'em with my blade.

111
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:34,956
Right.

112
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,189
This beauty...

113
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:39,721
This is for anything with horns.

114
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:40,823
Oh, goody.

115
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:42,799
- So I hook 'em like this.
- Yeah.

116
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:44,738
And then, bam!

117
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:47,476
Blade straight to the heart.

118
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,148
Right, I'm just gonna stop you there.

119
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:50,437
Do these grisly struggles

120
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,122
always end with you stabbing
a victim with your blade?

121
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:54,664
My blades were forged in Hell.

122
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,901
How else am I supposed
to kill a celestial being?

123
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:59,735
Damn. I already stabbed
him with one of your blades.

124
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:02,274
Well, I wish you would've told me that

125
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,845
before I hauled all
this out of the basement.

126
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,179
Nothing on Earth.

127
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,104
Nothing from Hell.

128
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,822
I mean, there must be some
way to snuff this candle.

129
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:12,171
Well...

130
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:14,632
Decker makes you killable, right?

131
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:15,734
- Hmm.
- Why don't you

132
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,005
see what's going on there?

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,753
Rub some of that on Pierce.

134
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:21,312
Apples to oranges, Maze.

135
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:22,476
What's going on there

136
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,918
is just a cruel joke from Dad.

137
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,157
And what's going on with Pierce isn't?

138
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,159
Your Father

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,115
is all about mind games
and loopholes, remember?

140
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:34,191
Yes, perhaps you're right, Maze.

141
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:38,212
Maybe I should find out
what makes Pierce vulnerable.

142
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,581
Get inside his head.

143
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:42,710
Not with the cranial saw.

144
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,245
Well, not yet

145
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:45,468
anyway.

146
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:01,125
Why is my couch in the
middle of my office?

147
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:02,495
Oh, good. You're here.

148
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:03,763
Please, take a seat.

149
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,967
How are you feeling today?

150
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:07,304
What are you doing?

151
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:09,625
Oh, answering a question
with another question.

152
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:11,312
That's called "evasion."

153
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:12,846
All right,

154
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,961
and your body language
suggests you're quite upset.

155
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:17,234
No, I'm just not a fan
of your redecorating.

156
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:18,812
That's awfully passive-aggressive

157
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:21,298
of you, Pierce. Why don't you
tell me how you really feel?

158
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,667
Get out of my office.

159
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:24,210
Good, good. Anger.

160
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:26,108
That's called a breakthrough, yeah.

161
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:28,379
Oh. Don't worry.

162
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,084
This is a safe place.

163
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:35,273
Why are you doing this?

164
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:36,296
Well, how am I supposed

165
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:38,039
to solve the mystery of how to kill you

166
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,210
if I don't understand you first?

167
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,174
Your strengths, your weaknesses.

168
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,078
Because everyone has a
Kryptonite, Lieutenant.

169
00:06:47,298 --> 00:06:50,303
So in other words, you still
have no idea how to kill me?

170
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:52,543
But... this is the idea.

171
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:55,268
I'm not a crier.

172
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:56,584
I'm not a sharer.

173
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:59,448
So unless you have something
that's case-related,

174
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,054
we're done talking.

175
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:04,602
And turn my desk around.

176
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:07,740
Decker.

177
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:08,942
Please tell me you're working

178
00:07:08,943 --> 00:07:10,546
on something interesting.

179
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:11,948
Pierce.

180
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,552
Lieutenant, you're still here.

181
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:14,620
D-Does that mean

182
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:16,206
you've decided to stay, or...?

183
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,210
Yeah.

184
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,214
At least for now.

185
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:19,628
Oh, that's great.

186
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:20,987
That's really, really great.

187
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,601
Two really's? Really?

188
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:23,984
Yeah, just 'cause...

189
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:27,062
I have a twist in my case,
and I could use your help.

190
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:28,915
So the suburban wood chipper victim,

191
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,586
we recovered a finger, ran a print.

192
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:32,623
Turns out June Lee isn't June Lee.

193
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:33,932
It's a false identity?

194
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:35,794
Our vic's real name is Sandra Jang,

195
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:38,851
and according to public record,
she died three years ago.

196
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:41,159
Fascinating. You know,

197
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,768
the lieutenant has a lot of
experience in fake deaths.

198
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:45,580
You must mean because I came up through

199
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,854
Missing Persons in Chicago.

200
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:47,558
Hmm.

201
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:48,921
Oh, great. We could really use

202
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:50,258
your experience on this, then.

203
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,028
Yes, I, too, would
love to learn everything

204
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,565
about your experience.

205
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:54,984
Sure.

206
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:56,424
Decker, why don't you pull

207
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:58,509
the original death certificate.
There might be something there.

208
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,776
You got it.

209
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,447
I know what you're trying to do.

210
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,924
If you mean solve a mystery, then yes.

211
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:06,190
And with you and I working
on this case together,

212
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,993
it'll kill two mysteries
with one stone, hmm?

213
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:10,599
Emphasis on the kill, of course.

214
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,603
Oh...

215
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:18,458
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

216
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,871
So if we can figure out why

217
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:26,808
Sandra faked her death three years ago,

218
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:27,948
it might point to her killer.

219
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,004
In my experience, people
who fake their own death

220
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:32,054
are running from something or someone.

221
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:35,468
Right, something or
someone that scares them,

222
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,058
makes them feel vulnerable.

223
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:40,144
Any experience of that in
your own life, Lieutenant?

224
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,115
Sandra definitely could've been running.

225
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:44,238
- Check her rap sheet.
- Possession of narcotics

226
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,321
and distribution.

227
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:48,051
Mm-hmm. For a gang
called the Korean Power.

228
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:49,621
Oh, not your typical gangbanger.

229
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:51,429
Uh, that's 'cause
she's not a gangbanger.

230
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:52,603
She's some kind of a chemist.

231
00:08:52,604 --> 00:08:54,386
Tech unlocked Sandra's laptop,

232
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:56,933
found, uh, recipes for
synthetic chemical compounds

233
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,187
all filed under the label "KPOP."

234
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,191
It's a kind of music,

235
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:01,246
- right?
- Oh, dear.

236
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,897
Poor Daniel, so behind the times.

237
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,910
K-Pop is a kind of Ecstasy.

238
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:06,483
It's one of the best kinds, actually.

239
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:10,441
Wait, so Sandra wasn't

240
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:13,143
dealing for the gang,
she was cooking for them.

241
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:15,371
I wonder if K-Pop is
still on the market?

242
00:09:15,374 --> 00:09:18,454
Oh, well, it was as of last Tuesday.

243
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:20,449
It's wonderful stuff.

244
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:23,269
Yeah, it makes your skin
feel like a baby chinchilla.

245
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,910
And as a nightclub owner,

246
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,225
you might know where to find some?

247
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:30,508
Oh, absolutely. Yes, and
I'd be happy to guide you

248
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:31,684
on your roll, Detective.

249
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:32,638
Though I would wait till you have

250
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,997
a day off to recover.

251
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,757
- I'm not...
- You want to squeeze a dealer.

252
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,216
Right, and work our way up
the chain to the Korean Power,

253
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,372
maybe find Sandra's killer.

254
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,367
There are dozens of
homicides tied to the gang.

255
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,966
Okay, one Ecstasy
dealer coming right up.

256
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:45,841
You two can meet me at Lux in an hour.

257
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:47,473
- Sure.
- Right. Daniel?

258
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:48,782
- Yeah?
- You can stay.

259
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,196
Oh, here's one.

260
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:58,454
Some idiot named Ben Simpson.

261
00:09:58,457 --> 00:10:00,895
Absconded in a stolen ice cream truck.

262
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,576
Six-five. Aggravated assault

263
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:04,546
with a blowtorch. Snore.

264
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:07,286
Don't you clowns have
anything challenging?

265
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:11,958
What is that?

266
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:14,133
Do you smell that?

267
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:15,361
Axe Body Spray.

268
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:25,989
Oh, hello. Uh, do I know you?

269
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,826
Used to.

270
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,832
I'm Lucifer's... friend.

271
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,344
Oh, so... we're friends?

272
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:36,009
Hell no.

273
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,505
You were a monstrous bitch

274
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:39,950
and I hated you. We were mortal enemies.

275
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:42,773
Right. I get that a lot.

276
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:47,062
Yeah, but now something's different.

277
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:49,502
It's...

278
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:51,473
wonderful.

279
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:53,845
And Lord knows I could
use a distraction.

280
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:57,285
Oh, well, I have been
trying to make changes.

281
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:59,890
You know, new leaf and all.

282
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:01,578
Hasn't been easy,

283
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:04,733
but I'm glad it's finally starting to...

284
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,547
come through.

285
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,661
Oh, something's coming
through all right.

286
00:11:11,614 --> 00:11:13,751
Oh.

287
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:15,655
You smell incredible.

288
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:22,492
What, um, exactly did you
say our relationship was?

289
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,066
Shh. Don't talk.

290
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,482
I've got to go hog-tie a fugitive

291
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:31,518
in an ice cream truck right now.

292
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:37,637
But... I will definitely be back.

293
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:56,536
Where's Pierce?

294
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:57,505
He said he was coming.

295
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,834
Well, he's probably
busy at the precinct.

296
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:00,973
And if you're worried

297
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:03,028
about him being checked out, relax.

298
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:05,454
He's sticking around L. A. For a while.

299
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:07,391
I kind of convinced him to stay.

300
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,427
Oh, don't be foolish.

301
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,801
The man's clearly staying for me.

302
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:11,648
Turns out we have quite a bit in common.

303
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:14,297
Right. So, back to reality,
where we have a case to solve,

304
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,036
where is this dealer you promised?

305
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,637
Two house specials, please.

306
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,649
Lucifer, you know I
don't drink on the job.

307
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,421
Here you go. Two house specials.

308
00:12:25,462 --> 00:12:27,833
Your bartender is a drug dealer?

309
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,137
What, you think I
hired him for abs alone?

310
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:31,465
Where'd you get the K-Pop?

311
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,915
I get it from the Korean Power.

312
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,726
Best "E" in town, or used to be.

313
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:38,945
Sad but true.

314
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,990
Previously hangover free,
but now in the morning,

315
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,163
your mouth's like Gandhi's flip-flop.

316
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:44,468
Hmm, what changed?

317
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:45,539
Their cook.

318
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:47,544
The gang used to have
some genius lady chemist,

319
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:48,908
but I heard she got greedy.

320
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:51,646
- She stole from the Korean Power?
- Yup.

321
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,836
Big, powerful, scary, boss dude,

322
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,968
and she pilfered right
from under his nose.

323
00:12:55,971 --> 00:12:57,122
Huh.

324
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,861
Pretty ballsy.

325
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,226
I mean, not that I would ever...

326
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:01,304
Yes, yes, get on with it.

327
00:13:01,307 --> 00:13:03,090
So, the boss put a
hit out on her, did he?

328
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:05,474
Yeah, but her lab blew up
before they could get to her.

329
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,605
- Freak accident.
- Accident?

330
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:10,820
Do you know this boss' name
or where we can find him?

331
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,586
Yeah. Brandon Hong.

332
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:14,687
He likes to hang out
at this one karaoke spot

333
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,092
over on Irolo.

334
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,631
But these guys don't mess around.

335
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:20,070
Right, well, mmm...

336
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:21,445
off we go, Detective.

337
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:23,031
What? Off we go to where?

338
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:25,437
To the karaoke parlor,
talk to a gang leader.

339
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,410
Maybe do a duet if you're
feeling adventurous.

340
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:29,617
We have to verify this
testimony with Vice.

341
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,921
We have to get a warrant,

342
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:32,289
assemble a SWAT team.

343
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,468
You know, actually plan
to do a gang takedown.

344
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:35,541
Right. Is that the sort of thing

345
00:13:35,543 --> 00:13:36,851
the lieutenant would get involved in?

346
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:39,591
No, Pierce will not get involved
until we bring him a suspect.

347
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:41,211
Which is why we should
just go to the parlor

348
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:42,281
and skip to that part.

349
00:13:42,284 --> 00:13:44,053
Lucifer, this is a ruthless drug lord

350
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,026
with who knows how many armed thugs?

351
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,591
You can't just walk in there
with your three-piece suit

352
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,359
and say...: "Hello, drug dealers."

353
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:53,632
I would never do that.

354
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:00,742
_

355
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,989
Come out, come out wherever you are.

356
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:11,734
- And who are you?
- I'm Lucifer.

357
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:13,894
Morningstar. But don't
worry, I'm here alone.

358
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:15,850
The police raid won't
happen for a few more hours.

359
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:16,600
Police raid?

360
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:19,475
Yes. So as you can see,
I'm in a bit of a rush.

361
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:21,145
Could you point me to the bigger gun?

362
00:14:21,146 --> 00:14:22,479
- Your boss?
- Get rid of him.

363
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:25,053
What is it with people
trying to avoid me today?

364
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:54,475
♪ More than a feeling ♪

365
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:25,504
- I'm only trying to help.
- Help?

366
00:15:27,612 --> 00:15:30,311
- Who?!
- You. The lieutenant.

367
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,120
I'm a giver, damn it.

368
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:33,827
And now you

369
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,633
are gonna help me.

370
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,238
Mr. Hong, thank you for coming in.

371
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:44,812
So, out-out of curiosity,
what... how did you know

372
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,148
that we wanted to speak to you?

373
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,253
Ah, when you're in my line of work,

374
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:50,084
word gets around, you know?

375
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:51,498
And what line of work is that?

376
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:52,602
Oh.

377
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:54,462
I run the Korean Power.

378
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:58,206
- Ah.
- Uh, we are a criminal organization

379
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,612
specializing in extortion
and drug dealing.

380
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:02,995
And, yes.

381
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:05,339
Sandra Jang used to cook our Ecstasy.

382
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:09,318
Oh. And while you're
being so forthcoming

383
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:11,425
about your felony distribution,

384
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,236
you care to confess to murder?

385
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:15,530
I'd love to help you,

386
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,844
but Sandra's death wasn't our doing.

387
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:19,207
What, even though she stole from you

388
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:20,783
and faked her own death to escape?

389
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:22,587
Yeah, she was a smart cookie.

390
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:24,316
I totally fell for the old

391
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,595
my-lab-exploded-and-I-died schtick.

392
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:27,653
But then,

393
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:31,096
like a voice from beyond, she called me.

394
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:33,975
Sandra stole money from
you to start a new life.

395
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:36,908
Why would she get back
in contact with you?

396
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:39,288
To pay the money back, with interest.

397
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,806
She was sick of looking
over her shoulder, I guess.

398
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:44,431
The suburbs gave her a double
garage and a conscience.

399
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,300
Yeah, I find that hard to believe.

400
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:47,506
You and your guys,

401
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,564
you aren't necessarily
known for your kindness.

402
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,912
Thank you.

403
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,151
And you're right.

404
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:55,978
I never forgave Sandra.

405
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,524
But not for stealing, for leaving.

406
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:00,439
When I found out she was still alive,

407
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:03,536
I begged her to come
back, but she said no.

408
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:06,742
Best cook I ever had.

409
00:17:06,743 --> 00:17:10,116
Our profits went down over
40% when we lost her formula.

410
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,757
So she was worth more
to you alive than dead.

411
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:16,729
Oh, um...

412
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,034
I've instructed my guys to cooperate.

413
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:23,309
You know, alibis and stuff for
the night Sandra was killed.

414
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,878
Whatever the police need.

415
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:28,219
Okay, you do understand that
even if you weren't involved

416
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,520
in Sandra's death, you have
confessed to several felonies

417
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:33,077
and we will be arresting you.

418
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,869
Whatever it takes to bring
Sandra's killer to justice.

419
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,073
Right.

420
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:48,377
That was the most cooperative
arch-criminal I've ever met.

421
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,361
Did you go to that club on your own?

422
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:51,899
What did you do to him?

423
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,369
Nothing. Just made him a deal.

424
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,908
Of course you did.

425
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:56,522
In exchange for his cooperation,

426
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:59,214
I gave him the formula we
found on Sandra's computer.

427
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:01,285
I mean, a few years in prison
is just a small price to pay

428
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:03,436
for doubling your profits
with a superior product.

429
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:07,088
You can't just hand out
random, illicit drug recipes.

430
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:09,471
Not random, Detective, the best.

431
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:11,544
I mean, you don't want inferior Ecstasy

432
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:13,340
out there on the streets, ruining orgies

433
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,913
and dubstep parties, now, do you?

434
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:18,674
Rhetorical. My point
is, I got us our suspect,

435
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:21,002
so can we finally
involve the lieutenant?

436
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:23,583
We are not involving Pierce
until we check Hong's story.

437
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:26,157
And if what he says is true,

438
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,728
he's not even a suspect.

439
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:32,447
There's one way to find out.

440
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,353
There is?

441
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:35,959
Well, what are we gonna find in there?

442
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:38,390
We already know about
Sandra's criminal past.

443
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:40,588
Yes, but what about
her criminal present?

444
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:44,002
Sandra paid cash for her
house, then two years later,

445
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:47,007
paid back the Korean mob, with interest.

446
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,728
Right. How'd she get that money?

447
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:51,469
Exactly. You can't do that on
a chemistry teacher's salary.

448
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:52,941
So, what do we think?

449
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:54,489
She was hacking into banks?

450
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:58,632
Or she decided to dust off her
old skill of cooking Ecstasy.

451
00:18:58,633 --> 00:18:59,847
- Right.
- Okay.

452
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,640
Now that we know what we're looking for,

453
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:04,482
let's try to find proof
that she was still making

454
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:07,056
and now selling drugs.

455
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:09,462
Huh. That's weird.

456
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:11,119
It's not connecting.

457
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:13,107
Oh, let me have a look at it.

458
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,147
Oh, Lucifer, please don't mess with it.

459
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,551
What does this do, anyway?

460
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,959
Stop shaking it. You're gonna break it.

461
00:19:20,164 --> 00:19:22,968
Ah, you're right, Detective.

462
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:25,259
It does help to know
what you're looking for.

463
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:30,541
Are those client lists? Ooh.

464
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,455
Well, an angry one, maybe.

465
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,252
"I know what you're doing.

466
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:36,938
End it or you're dead."

467
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,877
Ooh.

468
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,718
So, you can take the girl
out of the Ecstasy biz,

469
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,749
but you can't take the
Ecstasy biz out of the girl.

470
00:19:43,752 --> 00:19:45,259
Well, actually, it's not Ecstasy.

471
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,463
It's more sort of a homebrew Adderall.

472
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:49,200
It's very smooth.

473
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:51,197
Did your partner just
admit to snorting evidence?

474
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,811
The only thing I admit to is
being very focused on this case.

475
00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:56,481
We think Sandra adjusted

476
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:58,299
her product to her new environment.

477
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:00,105
Type-A moms,
high-pressure dads...

478
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,311
And all the Ivy League-bound
brats in between.

479
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:04,918
And if she was selling,
these death threats suggest

480
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:07,535
that someone didn't want those
drugs in the neighborhood.

481
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:09,479
We think she was trying
to determine who sent them.

482
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:11,049
And maybe looking got her killed.

483
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:12,417
All right. Get close to the neighbors.

484
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,635
See who you can smoke out.

485
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:15,335
Right. I-I had the exact same idea,

486
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:17,675
and there is a house for
rent on Sandra's block.

487
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:19,760
However, the owner will
only rent to couples.

488
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:21,408
Great. You and Lucifer are on it.

489
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:22,312
No, I'd love to,

490
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:23,664
but I canvassed the entire neighborhood.

491
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,046
They know I'm a cop. Dan, too.

492
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,443
So find another officer
with knowledge of this case

493
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:28,445
to go undercover.

494
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:29,514
Oh, don't worry.

495
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:31,150
We already have.

496
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:33,869
Hey, hey.

497
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:35,109
It's the welcome wagon.

498
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:36,627
Yeah, but not in the lame way.

499
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,979
We just want to be the first to say hi

500
00:20:38,982 --> 00:20:41,352
to the, uh, new couple on the block.

501
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:43,540
- I'm Brian. This is my wife Anya.
- Hey.

502
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:46,994
Thank you. That is so thoughtful.

503
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,288
Honey!

504
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,916
We have guests.

505
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,237
Ah. Right. Brian and Anya, this is Marc.

506
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,127
Hi. Oh.

507
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:03,680
Oh.

508
00:21:03,683 --> 00:21:05,318
Mmm.

509
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:07,315
All right.

510
00:21:07,318 --> 00:21:09,321
What, plastic plates?

511
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:10,457
What are we, barbarians?

512
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,826
Don't we have any china in there?

513
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:13,196
You know this isn't real, right?

514
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:14,398
I mea...

515
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,335
You realize this is just for the case.

516
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:19,775
This is my chance to
really get to know you.

517
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:21,445
Pierce, I'm taking it seriously

518
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,618
and so should you for our cause

519
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:25,404
and for the case, obviously.

520
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,962
So, let's just get in there
and put on a good show.

521
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:29,649
Shall we? Just don't give me

522
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:31,388
your resting Pierce face.

523
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,587
What face?

524
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:39,214
So, how did you two lovebirds meet?

525
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,638
We were high school
sweethearts, actually.

526
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:44,287
- Aw.
- We were biology partners.

527
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,091
He asked me out while we
were dissecting a crayfish.

528
00:21:47,094 --> 00:21:49,653
My wife. Oh, the stuff she remembers.

529
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:51,272
How about you? How'd you two meet?

530
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:53,630
- At work.
- Well, um, actually,

531
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:54,969
we met through my Dad.

532
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:55,839
Oh!

533
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:57,435
- So sweet.
- Well, not really.

534
00:21:57,438 --> 00:21:59,254
My Dad's a right bastard.

535
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:00,890
Oh, right, yes.

536
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:02,703
Tough, right? When
parents don't approve.

537
00:22:02,706 --> 00:22:04,963
It's true. True. And my
Father would definitely

538
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,078
disapprove of this.

539
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:07,474
Isn't that right, Marky Marc?

540
00:22:07,477 --> 00:22:10,243
Well, let's not start with that

541
00:22:10,244 --> 00:22:12,320
with these nice people, Luke.

542
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:15,728
I'm sorry. Marc loathes
talking about himself.

543
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:16,732
He's shy.

544
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,359
But don't let that put you off.

545
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,795
I mean, we are neighbors now, after all.

546
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,232
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

547
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:25,105
Feel free to ask him... I
mean, us... anything you want.

548
00:22:25,106 --> 00:22:26,375
Okay. All right.

549
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:27,911
- Shall we?
- Yes.

550
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:29,282
All right.

551
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:31,419
Thank you.

552
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:33,290
Smells delicious.

553
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:36,732
Ah, I get it.

554
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,623
You know, when Chloe and I got divorced,

555
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:40,370
I was so worried about Trixie.

556
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:42,574
What she would think,
when I would see her.

557
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:45,213
But I realized, it's
the quality of the time,

558
00:22:45,214 --> 00:22:46,582
not the quantity, you know?

559
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,716
I'm really glad we did this, Dan.

560
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,090
You're such a nice, normal guy.

561
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:54,464
Well, thank you, I think.

562
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:57,146
- I meant that as a compliment.
- Mm-hmm.

563
00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:59,541
I mean, after the past few months,

564
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:04,050
normal is exactly
what I need in my life.

565
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:09,150
Hey, sexy.

566
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:10,296
What's up, Dan?

567
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,999
Uh, hello.

568
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,852
You two know each other.

569
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:15,873
Oh, yeah.

570
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:18,144
We, uh, killed a guy together once.

571
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:21,644
Maze...

572
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:22,748
No.

573
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:25,422
Uh, what she means is,

574
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:26,857
we had a killer time,

575
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,086
together, once.

576
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:30,332
Why are you here, Maze?

577
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:32,005
Isn't it obvious?

578
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:39,252
The three of us?

579
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:41,225
I'm sorry.

580
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:43,629
Did we...?

581
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,631
Oh, no.

582
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,468
No. No, no, no, no, we didn't.

583
00:23:46,469 --> 00:23:48,472
No. Course n...

584
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:51,210
But if you wanted to...

585
00:23:51,211 --> 00:23:52,447
um,

586
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:55,319
now... whatever...

587
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,457
you're into.

588
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,138
I have heard that
it's... Can be empowering

589
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:03,034
'cause I've-I've been reading
this, uh, feminist social...

590
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:04,204
Well, I'm into it.

591
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,481
If she is.

592
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,486
It's ho... hot.

593
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:16,125
Oh... uh, can I have
another drink, please?

594
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,363
Thanks.

595
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:19,267
Milano?

596
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:21,405
Ooh. They're aren't any
nuts in there, are there?

597
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:23,219
I-I blow up like a balloon.

598
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:24,654
Of course, allergies.

599
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:26,315
- Yeah.
- I didn't think of that.

600
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:29,354
What makes us vulnerable is
often right under our noses.

601
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:31,029
Shellfish, maybe?

602
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:32,047
Huh?

603
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,819
Bees? Latex?

604
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:36,025
Oh, you know I don't have
any allergies, sweetie.

605
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:38,031
Let's talk about this lovely community.

606
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:39,206
You seem so tightknit.

607
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:41,029
Yes, yes. It must have been devastating

608
00:24:41,032 --> 00:24:44,086
when that poor woman was found
ground up like hamburger meat.

609
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,390
Our Realtor told us.

610
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:47,254
Yeah, it was horrible.
Huge loss. We're...

611
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:50,180
we're kind of one big
family around here.

612
00:24:50,183 --> 00:24:51,718
Well, most of us, anyway.

613
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:54,166
Some of the neighbors
can be a little uptight.

614
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:57,007
Ah, come on, babe, the guys
don't want to hear about that.

615
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,512
Right? We're here to welcome 'em.

616
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:01,279
- Hear about what?
- The Neighborhood Watchdog.

617
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:04,391
Someone has been writing notes
and terrorizing the block.

618
00:25:04,392 --> 00:25:06,495
Uh, "Trim your hedges, or else."

619
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:08,499
"Stop using non-organic weed killer,

620
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,880
or I'll make you drink it."

621
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,555
This Watchdog seems rather
preoccupied with gardening.

622
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,203
No. People have been getting
notes for all kinds of things.

623
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:18,735
Uh, loud music, parking,

624
00:25:18,738 --> 00:25:20,188
holiday decor.

625
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:24,047
It's like Martha Stewart and
the Terminator had a baby.

626
00:25:25,154 --> 00:25:27,133
Any idea who this "Watchdog" is?

627
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:28,430
No, actually.

628
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:30,149
Well, I suppose we
all have our mysteries.

629
00:25:30,152 --> 00:25:32,052
Don't we? Speaking of,

630
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:33,582
wouldn't you two like to know more

631
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,646
about this little enigma?

632
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:36,344
- Hmm?
- Well,

633
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:37,461
this has been nice.

634
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,392
Um, but remember, we
have to get get up early

635
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:40,732
for that thing tomorrow morning.

636
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:42,232
Uh...

637
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:45,961
No idea what you're
talking about, darling.

638
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,078
Here you go.

639
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,602
I thought you went to the bathroom.

640
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,825
No.

641
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:07,116
I'm sorry, I just...
needed a few minutes.

642
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:13,953
Truth is, I've... been
through hell lately.

643
00:26:17,103 --> 00:26:18,472
That's it.

644
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:20,297
No wonder I wanted you.

645
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,643
That's it.

646
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,716
I can smell it on you.

647
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:27,457
The pain, the torment.

648
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,654
What, it's that obvious?

649
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:31,765
Girl, it is all over you.

650
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:33,736
I guess I thought I was doing

651
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:36,821
a better job of covering it up.

652
00:26:36,824 --> 00:26:38,894
You see, um...

653
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,050
I died recently,

654
00:26:41,053 --> 00:26:46,060
or... well, almost... died.

655
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:48,832
And since then, it's been a struggle

656
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,571
to get my life back to
some semblance of normal.

657
00:26:51,572 --> 00:26:52,883
That's what you want?

658
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:54,121
Normal.

659
00:26:54,124 --> 00:26:57,129
Yes. Please, God, yes.

660
00:26:57,132 --> 00:26:59,768
Well, I am definitely not God.

661
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:01,005
Or normal.

662
00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:02,627
So, guess I'm out.

663
00:27:02,628 --> 00:27:04,497
Oh, y-you are?

664
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,200
I just...

665
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:08,439
I just told you my deepest secret.

666
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,399
Yeah.

667
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:10,391
Sorry.

668
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:12,200
I thought it was you I was attracted to,

669
00:27:12,203 --> 00:27:14,786
but turns out, it's just my old life.

670
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:18,047
And I'm... not sure if
I want to go back there.

671
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:23,058
Hey, but Dan's probably
still into it, though.

672
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:25,125
Hmm.

673
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:26,888
Thanks so much for dinner, bye.

674
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:28,211
Bye, have a good one.

675
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:40,513
This Watchdog weirdo seems promising.

676
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:42,607
And those notes sound
just like the one we found

677
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:43,775
in Sandra's stash.

678
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:46,581
I just can't imagine someone so obsessed

679
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,151
with obeying the rules of suburbia.

680
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:49,521
Where do you think you're going?

681
00:27:49,522 --> 00:27:51,558
I cook, you clean, remember?

682
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:54,599
Domesticity can have a
strange effect on people.

683
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:56,066
Question is, now,

684
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:58,639
how do we draw out this Watchdog?

685
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,810
Well, don't you worry
about that, Detective.

686
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,112
Trust me,

687
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,251
no one's a worse
neighbor than the Devil.

688
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:55,853
Lucifer.

689
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:57,590
What, are you building something?

690
00:28:57,591 --> 00:28:58,792
Yes.

691
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:01,397
Our reputation as the most
annoying neighbors on the block.

692
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:08,271
It's 4:00 a. m.

693
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:10,110
Maybe we can finish this in the morning.

694
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:12,350
"We"?

695
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:14,189
You're barely involved.

696
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,258
You know, I-I...

697
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:17,395
I thought this was supposed
to be about you and I

698
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:18,699
spending time together.

699
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,772
No. No, no. This is
about catching a killer.

700
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:29,921
Guys, someone's approaching the house.

701
00:29:29,922 --> 00:29:32,182
You just need to open up to me.

702
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:34,041
- Guys?
- That won't solve anything!

703
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:35,362
- Guys, heads up.
- Everyone has their Achilles' heel.

704
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:36,856
- Someone's approaching.
- We just need to find yours.

705
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,027
Right now, mine is you.

706
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:40,271
Guys. Damn it.

707
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:43,088
We've been through this.

708
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:44,822
Feel like I don't know you.

709
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,560
What are you talking about?

710
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:48,233
LAPD. Don't move.

711
00:29:53,468 --> 00:29:54,604
Oh.

712
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:55,603
Hello.

713
00:29:55,606 --> 00:29:57,349
Have you come for your casserole dish?

714
00:29:57,352 --> 00:29:59,122
Hands up.

715
00:30:04,251 --> 00:30:06,455
It's not illegal to hold people up

716
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:07,824
to our community standards.

717
00:30:07,825 --> 00:30:09,393
The police should be thanking me.

718
00:30:09,394 --> 00:30:12,467
I'm out there every
night helping you guys.

719
00:30:12,468 --> 00:30:15,840
Helping? Is that what you were
doing when you killed June Lee?

720
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:17,896
What? I di... I didn't hurt June.

721
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,963
I understand. You're out there,

722
00:30:19,966 --> 00:30:22,119
you're trying to keep
your neighborhood clean.

723
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,981
And then June's there, dealing drugs.

724
00:30:23,984 --> 00:30:26,862
Wait, you think I was trying to
get June to stop dealing drugs?

725
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:27,989
I was her best customer.

726
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,458
You were buying her Adderall?

727
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:30,658
Uh, yeah.

728
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,172
Me and half the block.

729
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:33,308
How do you think I had the energy

730
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:35,713
to be out there every night, all night?

731
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:37,981
I mean, June changed my life.

732
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:39,886
I learned Mandarin.

733
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:43,286
I built a deck around
my... I-I lost 40 pounds.

734
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:44,457
Okay.

735
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,167
So you're saying you didn't
write that threatening note?

736
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,239
No, that's not even my
handwrit... look, look at it.

737
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,277
It's so sloppy. Of course,
what do you expect from someone

738
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,208
clueless enough to put a whole
body into a wood chipper? Wha...

739
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:56,312
I-I mean,

740
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:57,350
saw before you mulch.

741
00:30:57,353 --> 00:30:58,689
Everyone knows that.

742
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:01,372
Thanks.

743
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:02,792
Ah. Now, he would know

744
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:05,372
not to put onion skins
down the garbage disposal.

745
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:06,875
You know, why wouldn't I put onion skins

746
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:08,411
down the garbage disposal?

747
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:09,514
They're garbage.

748
00:31:09,515 --> 00:31:10,883
- They're compost.
- You know what?

749
00:31:10,884 --> 00:31:12,687
Thank God that this marriage is over.

750
00:31:12,688 --> 00:31:13,889
Guys.

751
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,659
Brian's not our killer.

752
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,164
But your cover is still intact

753
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,539
and I have a new plan.

754
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:21,140
You lovebirds ready
to go back to suburbia?

755
00:31:23,242 --> 00:31:24,644
Ah.

756
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:26,132
Till death do us part,

757
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,438
darling.

758
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:35,171
Well, how's this angle, Detective?

759
00:31:35,174 --> 00:31:36,768
A little to the right, and make sure

760
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,438
you put the guest book
where I can see it.

761
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,951
Don't worry, Decker, we'll
be checking handwriting

762
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:41,812
as we go along, I just
hope people show up

763
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:43,381
after Lucifer's antics.

764
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:46,304
Ah, I've simply piqued their curiosity.

765
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:58,032
Oh, we... we'd like everyone to sign.

766
00:31:58,035 --> 00:31:59,210
Please.

767
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:00,983
Makes it more personal.

768
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:06,893
Um, why is that hummus so
far away from the crudités?

769
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:08,325
- What?
- Everyone knows

770
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:11,437
you put the snacks next
to the dipping sauce. I...

771
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:12,807
Why do I feel like I'm
the only one putting

772
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:13,942
any effort into anything?

773
00:32:13,943 --> 00:32:16,313
Probably because you're
making everything about you.

774
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:17,950
Me?

775
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:21,601
In case you've forgotten,
I am doing this for you.

776
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:23,068
- Really?
- Yes, really.

777
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,731
And if you're not committed,
then there's no point

778
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:25,733
to us even being here.

779
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:28,234
The only reason I'm here
is because I have to be.

780
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,598
- Ah.
- Everything else is just an empty promise.

781
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:31,945
You have no idea what you're doing.

782
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:32,980
I beg your pardon?

783
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:35,296
You say you're a man of your word.

784
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:36,855
But you're not.

785
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,753
Can't believe he just said that.

786
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:45,292
Excuse me!

787
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:52,670
Lucifer.

788
00:32:53,757 --> 00:32:55,391
Lucifer.

789
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,897
What the hell are you
guys doing back there?

790
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:00,535
This is a sting... you can't
just leave in the middle of it.

791
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:02,572
I just can't be around him right now.

792
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:05,545
Lucifer, sometimes
when you go undercover,

793
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:08,492
things get real, people
get on each other's nerves.

794
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:09,617
But here's the thing:

795
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,422
you can't change your partner.

796
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:12,661
Tell me about it.

797
00:33:12,664 --> 00:33:16,403
Okay... as hard as it is right now,

798
00:33:16,406 --> 00:33:20,112
I need you to stick it
out until the job's done.

799
00:33:20,115 --> 00:33:22,512
Pierce is never gonna be
the guy who cares about

800
00:33:22,513 --> 00:33:24,416
where the hummus is, or whatever.

801
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,755
But he does care about what matters.

802
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,437
Like solving this case.

803
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,896
He can't do it without
you, and he knows that.

804
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:34,002
- Does he?
- Yes, he does.

805
00:33:34,003 --> 00:33:35,873
So, please, get back in there

806
00:33:35,874 --> 00:33:38,000
and get those signatures.

807
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:42,327
Right.

808
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:59,021
You moved the nachos.

809
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:05,406
Well, yeah, I didn't want
anyone to spill salsa...

810
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:06,978
Into the macaroni.

811
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:14,438
Wasn't sure you were coming back.

812
00:34:14,441 --> 00:34:15,951
I made you a promise.

813
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,578
And I am a man of my word,

814
00:34:17,581 --> 00:34:19,827
no matter what you may think.

815
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:22,578
I may have overreacted.

816
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:23,816
I'm sorry.

817
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:25,555
Thank you.

818
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:27,561
But...

819
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:30,802
you were right about one thing.

820
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:33,710
I don't have all the answers.

821
00:34:33,713 --> 00:34:36,485
But I hope that

822
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:39,126
we can find them... together.

823
00:34:40,174 --> 00:34:44,085
I mean, after all, you may be
the only person on this planet

824
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:46,226
who truly understands me.

825
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,952
I'm not ready to give up on that.

826
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:52,624
Aw...

827
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:09,257
Wow. Cover officially restored.

828
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,867
Okay, now can we please
check the book for signatures?

829
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,845
Forgive me.

830
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:21,242
Ah, Marcie, uh,

831
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:22,414
some words for the chef?

832
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:23,518
Ooh, I've got mustard on...

833
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,858
Some words for the chef!

834
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:30,585
Lovely. Would you mind
working the word "pervert"

835
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:32,691
in there somewhere?

836
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:35,298
Could you address it
to "scheming whore"?

837
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:38,569
Just a little private joke for Marc.

838
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,025
Brian said he signed
for us both already.

839
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:44,029
Well, Marc and I would
like everyone to write

840
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,899
- a little message, if you don't mind.
- Oh.

841
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,669
Okay. Uh, let's see.

842
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,554
Actually, um, I think it's, uh...

843
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:51,163
I think it's time for us to go, dear.

844
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:52,280
But we just got here.

845
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,947
Uh, yeah, I know, but we really

846
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,917
need to go.

847
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:57,121
Brian, please.
What-wh-what are you doing?

848
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:58,123
Just put the book down.

849
00:35:58,124 --> 00:35:59,296
- Brian!
- Brian...

850
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:00,696
- Brian, please...
- Just a little message.

851
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:01,766
No, no, no, I know what you guys are

852
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:03,131
- trying to do here.
- Brian.

853
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:04,502
Hey, Brian, just relax, okay.

854
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:05,504
Just calm down.

855
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:07,476
Take it easy.

856
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,918
Everybody get back!

857
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:12,093
Go on, get back. All
right, yeah? Get back.

858
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:13,532
Brian. Bri...

859
00:36:13,535 --> 00:36:14,718
We're leaving.

860
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:18,941
Thanks. It was great.

861
00:36:20,732 --> 00:36:22,927
- What about hedge trimmers?
- Tried it. Didn't work.

862
00:36:22,928 --> 00:36:24,531
- Put it down, Brian.
- Uh...

863
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:26,995
I didn't want to hurt anybody.

864
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:31,229
I know. And I know you don't
want to hurt anyone right now.

865
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:33,810
You're not a killer,
you're just protecting one.

866
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:38,023
Brian, what is she talking about?

867
00:36:38,024 --> 00:36:41,403
You wrote the threatening note to June.

868
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:43,118
We accused your
husband, but he must have

869
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:45,339
recognized your handwriting
when we showed it to him.

870
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:48,285
That's why he didn't want
you signing the guest book.

871
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:52,470
You know?

872
00:36:52,473 --> 00:36:55,258
How could you do
something so stupid, babe?

873
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:56,628
I'm not stupid.

874
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:59,236
I know that you and June
were having an affair.

875
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,903
- No.
- I saw you

876
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:02,406
sneaking around with her,

877
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:04,075
and then you lost all that weight.

878
00:37:04,076 --> 00:37:05,646
I thought I would just write her

879
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:07,614
one of those notes to scare her off,

880
00:37:07,617 --> 00:37:10,860
but then you still kept
sneaking out every night.

881
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:12,504
And then you went and confronted her.

882
00:37:13,696 --> 00:37:15,699
Yes, but then she just kept denying it,

883
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,540
and I got so,

884
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:21,043
so angry I just... shoved
her, and then she...

885
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:22,308
she hit her head.

886
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:24,983
But I d... I didn't mean to kill her.

887
00:37:24,986 --> 00:37:26,155
I just...

888
00:37:26,158 --> 00:37:29,324
I just didn't want you to leave me.

889
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,869
But he wasn't having an affair.

890
00:37:31,872 --> 00:37:33,709
June was his drug dealer.

891
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,660
It's true.

892
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:40,012
I was buying pills from
her to help me lose weight.

893
00:37:40,015 --> 00:37:42,353
For you, so that I could
go back to being the guy

894
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:44,357
that you fell in love
with in high school.

895
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:47,566
I didn't want you to leave me.

896
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:49,961
I'm so sorry I doubted you.

897
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:54,477
I just... I don't know
what I would do without you.

898
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:57,716
Neither do I. Oh...

899
00:37:59,217 --> 00:38:01,220
Okay, show's over.

900
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:03,727
Yeah, I suppose there's
some cold comfort

901
00:38:03,729 --> 00:38:05,966
in them being arrested together.

902
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,937
At least they've got each other.

903
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,933
Yeah, they do.

904
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:21,096
Dan?

905
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,089
Hey.

906
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:26,058
I just wanted to come by and apologize

907
00:38:26,061 --> 00:38:27,363
about the other night.

908
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:31,575
You have nothing to apologize for.

909
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:34,336
I absolutely, completely blame Maze.

910
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:35,644
That girl is a freak.

911
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,383
She is odd.

912
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:41,101
But she also made me realize
some things about myself.

913
00:38:41,104 --> 00:38:44,261
Maze isn't the only odd one.

914
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:46,634
I'm a mess.

915
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:50,754
All that talk about
feeling normal again?

916
00:38:50,757 --> 00:38:52,526
Wishful thinking.

917
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:54,230
I have a long road ahead.

918
00:38:56,316 --> 00:38:59,554
You know, whatever this is that we have,

919
00:38:59,557 --> 00:39:01,494
it has never been normal.

920
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:06,136
And I decided that I
just have to own that.

921
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:11,497
I like you, Charlotte.

922
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:15,271
You are unlike anyone I have ever met.

923
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:18,778
So if you need time to
sort some things out,

924
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:20,785
I can wait.

925
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,255
You're worth it.

926
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,236
So, I heard the divorce went through.

927
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:32,840
What are you gonna do
with your half of Lux?

928
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:34,675
Very funny, Decker.

929
00:39:34,678 --> 00:39:35,900
What's up?

930
00:39:35,903 --> 00:39:38,098
Some of us from the precinct
are going down to the Paddock

931
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,402
for beers after work,

932
00:39:39,405 --> 00:39:40,454
and I thought you might want to join,

933
00:39:40,455 --> 00:39:42,158
if you don't have anything better to do.

934
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,808
I don't think I should.

935
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:45,797
Oh, yeah, no big deal.

936
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,838
Just, like I said, a lot
of people are going, so...

937
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,207
Listen, Chloe,

938
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,613
you and I, it's not a good idea.

939
00:39:52,614 --> 00:39:57,221
Oh, I wasn't suggesting
anything romantic at all.

940
00:39:57,222 --> 00:39:58,558
- I just...
- Listen, it's just

941
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,714
we deal with death every day,

942
00:40:00,717 --> 00:40:03,054
and...

943
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:04,626
everybody's gonna die.

944
00:40:04,629 --> 00:40:06,532
Someday you'll die, and I just...

945
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:08,170
Yeah.

946
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,711
Losing your brother, it's still

947
00:40:10,714 --> 00:40:12,249
really affecting you, huh?

948
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:16,359
Understatement of the millennia.

949
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,465
I understand. I do.

950
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:21,918
And about tonight, it's not a big deal.

951
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:25,810
But...

952
00:40:25,813 --> 00:40:31,472
just so I know that I'm not crazy, um...

953
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:33,260
in the surveillance van,

954
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:36,199
when I asked you to stay in L. A.,

955
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,933
we did have a moment there, yeah?

956
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:41,978
We did share a moment.

957
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:44,248
Which is why I had to tell you

958
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:47,656
that I'm not relationship material.

959
00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:49,393
Mm.

960
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:53,964
Well, for what it's worth,

961
00:40:53,976 --> 00:40:55,605
it was a really nice moment.

962
00:41:07,905 --> 00:41:10,876
Lucifer, this better be good.

963
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:12,894
I was really looking forward to sleeping

964
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:15,019
far away from you tonight.

965
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,025
Oh, it is good.

966
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:19,298
I've finally got you figured out.

967
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:21,644
- Really?
- Mm, yes.

968
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:24,117
You're terrified of letting
someone get close to you

969
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,725
'cause you know they'll
eventually leave you.

970
00:41:26,728 --> 00:41:28,527
You'll outlive them.

971
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,852
You want to die because

972
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,677
you don't want to be alone anymore.

973
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,519
Yeah, well, duh.

974
00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:36,477
- What's your point?
- If we're gonna kill you...

975
00:41:37,654 --> 00:41:41,093
then we have got to do it together.

976
00:41:41,096 --> 00:41:43,033
Is that right?

977
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,050
Mm.

978
00:41:44,053 --> 00:41:46,370
You see, I don't think you've
been spending time with me

979
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:48,310
trying to figure out how to kill me.

980
00:41:48,311 --> 00:41:49,938
I think you want to spend time

981
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,784
with someone who's
been screwed by your Dad

982
00:41:51,785 --> 00:41:52,919
as much as you've been.

983
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,253
You are the one that
doesn't want to be alone.

984
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:01,727
I suppose one might call us friends now.

985
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,699
And it is nice to have
a friend who can relate.

986
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:06,070
I get you.

987
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:08,477
No, you don't.

988
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,955
But you've been on the
earth, what, five years?

989
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:13,074
You'll see.

990
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:15,380
It's hard not to get attached.

991
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:18,667
Okay. Okay.

992
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,641
So we both have some issues
that we need to work through.

993
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:23,152
But if we're gonna get revenge on Dad,

994
00:42:23,155 --> 00:42:25,448
we've got to be committed.

995
00:42:25,451 --> 00:42:27,003
I've already married you.

996
00:42:27,006 --> 00:42:29,175
I'm not sure how much
more committed I could be.

997
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,734
True. True.

998
00:42:34,737 --> 00:42:36,277
But there are so many things

999
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,050
that we never got to try.

1000
00:42:43,452 --> 00:42:45,320
Fine.

1001
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:47,193
Go get the chain saw.

1002
00:42:47,196 --> 00:42:50,498
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
