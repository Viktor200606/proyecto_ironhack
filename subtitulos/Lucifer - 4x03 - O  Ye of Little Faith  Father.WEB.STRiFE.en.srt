00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,731
<i>Forgive me, Father...</i>

3
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,733
<i>for not offering you a drink.</i>

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,611
<i>I have an aversion to the cloth. </i>
<i>Daddy issues.</i>

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,738
<i>Long story.</i>

6
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:33,867
<i>I understand, and I do apologize </i>
<i>for the intrusion, Mr. Morningstar.</i>

7
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,244
<i>Please allow me to explain myself.</i>

8
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,954
<i>Excellent course of action.</i>

9
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,166
<i>You see, I'm not a normal priest.</i>

10
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>[laughing] Was there ever such a thing?</i>

11
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,962
<i>I mean I'm not a normal priest</i>
<i>in the sense</i>

12
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,256
<i>that I don't have my own congregation.</i>

13
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,175
<i>I am a...</i>

14
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:51,968
<i>I'm an investigator.</i>

15
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,678
<i>For the Vatican.</i>

16
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,016
<i>Vatican investigator?</i>

17
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,643
<i>Sounds like a soon-to-be-canceled </i>
<i>TV show.</i>

18
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,771
<i>I assure you, it's a very real job.</i>

19
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,608
<i>I've spent the last 40 years traveling</i>
<i>the globe in pursuit of the demonic.</i>

20
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,277
<i>I know the divine is real.</i>

21
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,322
<i>And I also know that evil walks the earth.</i>

22
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,199
<i>And that you, Mr. Morningstar--</i>

23
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,034
<i>Oh, brother, here we go.</i>

24
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,035
<i>Are not it.</i>

25
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,539
<i>Not quite what I was expecting.</i>

26
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,377
<i>So if I'm not the devil,</i>
<i>then why are you here?</i>

27
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,297
<i>And what does any of this</i>
<i>have to do with the Detective?</i>

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,382
<i>Because Miss Decker believes that you are.</i>

29
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,635
<i>I see.</i>

30
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,846
<i>About a month ago, she came to Rome</i>
<i>with a most outlandish tale.</i>

31
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,225
<i>The devil himself</i>
<i>is hiding in plain sight,</i>

32
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,353
<i>masquerading as a nightclub owner</i>
<i>in Los Angeles,</i>

33
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,773
<i>and that he'd revealed himself to her.</i>

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:48,942
<i>Well...</i>

35
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,610
<i>this is wonderful news.</i>

36
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>Wonderful? How so?</i>

37
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,115
<i>Well, as my therapist would say--</i>
<i>I know, so LA...</i>

38
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,201
<i>But she'd say</i>
<i>that talking about your issues</i>

39
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,953
<i>was the first step in dealing with them,</i>

40
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,497
<i>so if the Detective did have issues</i>
<i>with me...</i>

41
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,457
<i>sounds like they've been dealt with.</i>

42
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,002
<i>Now, if that's everything, Father,</i>
<i>you can be on your merry way.</i>

43
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,047
<i>I just felt that it was my duty </i>
<i>to warn you.</i>

44
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,968
<i>Because the reason that she came to Rome</i>
<i>was to, well...</i>

45
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,262
<i>send the devil back to hell.</i>

46

<i>[laughs]</i>

47
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,974
<i>The Detective would never do that.</i>

48
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,268
<i>Chloe is a good person with a good heart.</i>

49
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,353
<i>Finally, something we can agree on.</i>

50
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,481
<i>But whatever she went through,</i>
<i>whatever drove her to Rome...</i>

51
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,525
<i>it shook her to her very core.</i>

52
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,112
<i>She's the reason that I'm here.</i>

53
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:39,325
<i>You need to be careful, Mr. Morningstar.</i>

54
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,996

<i>What are you so cheery about, Decker?</i>

57
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,268
<i>What?</i>

58
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,937
<i>-I'm not cheery.</i>
<i>-Wait, why aren't you cheery?</i>

59
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,023
<i>I've been nursing a bad one all day.</i>

60
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,442
<i>Ha! What? Too much Romulan ale?</i>

61
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,818
<i>Too much tequila.</i>

62
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,447
<i>I went a little nutso</i>
<i>on all the margeritas yesterday.</i>

63
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,326
<i>Yesterday, Sunday...</i>
<i>Did you swap out the sacramental wine?</i>

64
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,328
<i>I skipped church yesterday.</i>

65
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,038
<i>And the week before, you said.</i>

66
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,542
<i>Listen, Ella,</i>
<i>I sort of wanted to check in with you,</i>

67
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,170
<i>-to see--</i>
<i>-You know, it's just...</i>

68
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,839
<i>me and the big guy</i>
<i>are on a bit of a break.</i>

69
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,092
<i>I completely... understand. </i>
<i>I mean, more than you'll ever know.</i>

70
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,177
<i>In fact...</i>

71
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,553
<i>recently...</i>

72
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,973
<i>I got clarity on a very similar issue.</i>

73
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,516
<i>And...</i>

74
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,394
<i>I think it's why I've been feeling</i>
<i>so positive lately.</i>

<i>Hang on.</i>

79
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,653

00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,449
<i>Well, are you going to answer that?</i>

83
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,450
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

84
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,993

<i>I'll show you what that was.</i>

91
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,717
<i>Yeah.</i>

92
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,177

<i>Look, I know you and Lucifer</i>
<i>have had your issues lately,</i>

<i>Know what? I'm sick and tired</i>
<i>of everybody making excuses for him.</i>

100

<i>I wish you could just see</i>
<i>a little bit of what I see, Chloe.</i>

<i>He's...</i>

102

<i>he's a bad guy.</i>

<i>He's...</i>

104
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,666
<i>he's trying to be better.</i>

<i>He... in his own way.</i>

106
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,670

<i>How is it even possible?</i>

<i>Mm.</i>

<i>Maybe there's another explanation.</i>

<i>You think Linda's an angel in disguise,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

125
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,725
<i>I've been wondering the same thing.</i>
<i>Maybe she's not even human.</i>

126
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:55,313
<i>Or, maybe, when you lost your wings,</i>
<i>you became as mortal as it gets.</i>

127
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,149
<i>Maybe you became more human</i>

<i>Oh.</i>

129
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,444

00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,673
<i>Because I have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>what to do.</i>

138

169
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,124
<i>[Ella sighs]</i>
<i>Well, better than this poor girl.</i>

170
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:43,629
<i>Susan Ochoa, 29. A bona fide</i>
<i>rocket scientist at Brody Aerospace.</i>

171
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,383
<i>Neighbor saw the door open,</i>
<i>body on the floor, called it in.</i>

172
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,677
<i>-I'm assuming that's the murder weapon.</i>
<i>-Yep.</i>

173
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,429
<i>A good old knife in the back.</i>

174
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,847
<i>Bit on the nose.</i>

175
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,475
<i>So no forced entry...</i>

176
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,477
<i>two glasses,</i>

177
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,769
<i>someone brought flowers.</i>

178
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,438
<i>She knew her attacker.</i>

179
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,524
<i>It's always the ones you least suspect,</i>
<i>the ones you trust the most,</i>

180
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,775
<i>that hurt you.</i>

181
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,571
<i>[Ella] They wait until your guard is down</i>
<i>and then wham!</i>

182
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,698
<i>In my case, it was tequila.</i>

183
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:11,991
<i>Riveting.</i>

184
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,118
<i>Any witnesses?</i>

185
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,454
<i>None, but the victim's friend</i>
<i>might know more.</i>

186
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,164
<i>Oscar.</i>

187
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,293
<i>Do you know anyone who would have wanted</i>
<i>to hurt Susan, Mr. Rivas?</i>

188
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,962
<i>No. Everybody liked Susan.</i>

189
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,672
<i>Who did she trust the most?</i>

190
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,675
<i>To be honest, I don't know much </i>
<i>about Susan's life here.</i>

191
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,929
<i>I just came from El Salvador. She was</i>
<i>supposed to pick me up from the airport.</i>

192
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,889
<i>When she didn't show, I came here and...</i>

193
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,141
<i>I saw all of this.</i>

194
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,393
<i>-And how do you know her?</i>
<i>-[Oscar] We were in a gang.</i>

195
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,229
<i>Los Xs.</i>

196
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,024
<i>A gang member turned rocket scientist.</i>
<i>Gosh, and I thought I had range.</i>

197
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,443
<i>When I left the life,</i>
<i>I wanted to pay it forward.</i>

198
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,154
<i>So I helped people like Susan</i>
<i>get out and get clean.</i>

199
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,405
<i>She was a drug addict?</i>

200
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,783
<i>Don't judge her. A lot of us were.</i>

201
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,701
<i>Oh, I'm not judging. I love drugs.</i>

202
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,287
<i>In fact, do you think she might have any</i>
<i>lying around? [giggles]</i>

203
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,749
<i>Do you know if Susan</i>
<i>still had any connection to Los Xs?</i>

204
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,251
<i>No, she made a clean break.</i>

205
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,046
<i>She moved here, went to school,</i>
<i>made an amazing life for herself.</i>

206
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,635
<i>Promise me you will punish</i>
<i>the son of a bitch that did this.</i>

207
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,553
<i>Oh...</i>

208
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,054
<i>with pleasure.</i>

209
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,849
<i>Okay. Thank you, Mr. Rivas.</i>
<i>We'll be in touch if we need anything.</i>

210
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,103
<i>You take him. Let's get in touch with</i>
<i>next of kin and head back to the precinct.</i>

211
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,312
<i>I meant what I said earlier.</i>

212
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,605
<i>What do you mean?</i>

213
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,233
<i>That I don't care</i>
<i>what people think about me.</i>

214
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:32,238
<i>So if you want to talk to anyone about,</i>
<i>you know, me being the devil... [laughs]</i>

215
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,033
<i>That is if you haven't already, then,</i>
<i>just know that it is totally fine with me.</i>

216
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,203
<i>Okay. I don't think that's necessary.</i>

217
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,706
<i>Right.</i>
<i>So you haven't told anyone about me?</i>

218
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,207
<i>No.</i>

219
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,917
<i>No, not a soul.</i>

220
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,809
{\an8}<i>[female] She's a monster.</i>

221
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,729
{\an8}<i>Demanding, complains all the time.</i>

222
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,523
{\an8}<i>It's like nothing is ever good enough.</i>

223
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,401
{\an8}<i>And how old is Brooklyn now?</i>

224
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:16,198
{\an8}<i>Three. You know, sometimes I catch her</i>
<i>looking at me like she knows she's won.</i>

225
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,908
{\an8}<i>It can't be all bad.</i>

226
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,036
{\an8}<i>-Can it?</i>
<i>-Don't you get it?</i>

227
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,329
{\an8}<i>She's a sociopath.</i>

228
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,123
{\an8}<i>Children are all sociopaths.</i>

229
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,041
{\an8}<i>[door opens]</i>

230
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,500
{\an8}<i>[Lucifer sighs] Time's up.</i>

231
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,128
{\an8}<i>Apologies, I've more pressing matters</i>
<i>to discuss with the doctor.</i>

232
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,963
{\an8}<i>I'm in the middle of my session here.</i>

233
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,175
{\an8}<i>Well, the doctor is with child.</i>
<i>She needs her rest.</i>

234
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,427
{\an8}<i>How dare you burden her</i>
<i>with your petty concerns, now?</i>

235
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,762
{\an8}<i>Run along. Come on, shoo!</i>

236
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,347
{\an8}<i>-[patient squeaks]</i>
<i>-Shoo.</i>

237
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,724
{\an8}<i>-[patient squeaks]</i>
<i>-[door bangs]</i>

238
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,059
{\an8}<i>So...</i>

239
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,478
{\an8}<i>I hear congratulations are in order.</i>

240
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,564
{\an8}<i>Some people claim</i>
<i>to find the life-long burden fulfilling.</i>

241
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,817
<i>I'd rather not talk about the pregnancy</i>
<i>at work, if you don't mind.</i>

242
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,695
{\an8}<i>Lips sealed. So, about me...</i>

243
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,074
{\an8}<i>What do you do</i>
<i>when someone has betrayed you?</i>

244
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,577
{\an8}<i>Normally I'd go straight to punishment,</i>
<i>fire, brimstone,</i>

245
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,371
{\an8}<i>public humiliation via YouTube.</i>

246
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,666
{\an8}<i>But in this case,</i>
<i>the subject happens to be none other...</i>

247
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,334
{\an8}<i>than the Detective.</i>

248
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,293
<i>Wait, Chloe?</i>

249
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,628
<i>What did she do?</i>

250
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,463
{\an8}<i>I caught her in a lie.</i>

251
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,716
{\an8}<i>A most heinous transgression.</i>

252
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,678
<i>Oh, and she may be plotting</i>
<i>to send me back to hell.</i>

253
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,389
{\an8}<i>Okay, that's a very serious accusation.</i>

254
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,767
<i>-How do you know this?</i>
<i>-A complete stranger told me.</i>

255
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,937
<i>Have you talked to Chloe about this?</i>

256
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,731
{\an8}<i>Well, she's lied once.</i>
<i>What's to stop her from lying again?</i>

257
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,983
{\an8}<i>I just need you to tell me</i>
<i>how to deal with her.</i>

258
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,902
{\an8}<i>Cautiously, Lucifer.</i>

259
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,864
{\an8}<i>There may be a very reasonable explanation</i>
<i>for Chloe's behavior.</i>

260
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,992
<i>Like a spouse who suspects</i>
<i>their partner's been cheating,</i>

261
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,539
{\an8}<i>an accusation of betrayal</i>
<i>is a bell that can't be un-rung.</i>

262
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,582
<i>Translation, doctor?</i>

263
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,459
<i>Feel her out a bit.</i>

264
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,470
{\an8}<i>Susan survived Los Xs and then made it</i>
<i>as an engineer at Brody Aerospace.</i>

265
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,264
<i>I think I've got myself a new hero.</i>

266
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,141
<i>I find it pretty pathetic.</i>

267
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,143
<i>That's a little dark, don't you think?</i>

268
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,229
{\an8}<i>I mean, it's great</i>
<i>that a former criminal got clean</i>

269
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,814
{\an8}<i>and figured out her life, but for what?</i>

270
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,233
<i>Dan, it's about the journey,</i>
<i>not the destination.</i>

271
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,402
{\an8}<i>[Dan laughs] She did all that work...</i>

272
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,197
{\an8}<i>turned her life around, just to get shot</i>
<i>and killed for no reason at all.</i>

273
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,991
<i>You mean stabbed.</i>

274
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,993
{\an8}<i>Yeah, yeah. I didn't--</i>

275
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,369
{\an8}<i>I know what you meant.</i>

276
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,788
<i>I really miss Charlotte too.</i>

277
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,083
<i>And, hey, if you ever...</i>

278
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,212
{\an8}<i>need to talk, seriously,</i>
<i>or you just need a hug or...</i>

279
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,382
{\an8}<i>-Sometimes, there's comfort--</i>
<i>-No, no, don't, don't.</i>

280
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,552
{\an8}<i>Don't start, Ella, with the whole</i>
<i>"it's all part of his grand plan,</i>

281
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,388
{\an8}<i>mysterious ways" crap right now, okay,</i>
<i>I just--</i>

282
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,682
{\an8}<i>I wasn't going to say any of that.</i>

283
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,435
{\an8}<i>I... Honestly...</i>

284
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,480
{\an8}<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>if that's what I believe anymore.</i>

285
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,107
{\an8}<i>Right. Could have fooled me.</i>

286
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,821
{\an8}<i>Fair enough.</i>

287
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,700
{\an8}<i>Look, I'm sorry, Ella, I didn't--</i>

288
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,703
{\an8}<i>No, no, you're right.</i>
<i>Practice what you preach.</i>

289
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,247
{\an8}<i>And right now...</i>

290
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,918
{\an8}<i>I'm not sure what I'm preaching.</i>

291
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,131
{\an8}<i>What's in the file?</i>

292
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,344
{\an8}<i>Ah... flowers found at the crime scene.</i>

293
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:25,930
<i>Bismarck hyacinths.</i>

294
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,974
<i>Rare, only found in five flower markets,</i>

295
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,227
<i>one of which sold the bouquet</i>
<i>the night of the murder.</i>

296
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,436
<i>Do we know who bought them?</i>

297
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,315
<i>Well, receipts track to the credit card</i>
<i>of tech genius-cum-billionaire,</i>

298
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,859
<i>owner of Brody Aerospace, Anders Brody.</i>

299
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,861
<i>Susan Ochoa's boss.</i>

300
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,824
<i>-Erm, I'll tell Chloe.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

301
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,549
<i>A bit self-aggrandizing, don't you think?</i>

302
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,175
<i>Maybe he's compensating for something.</i>

303
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,263
<i>Cue relentless onslaught</i>
<i>of small penis jokes in three, two, one...</i>

304
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,560
<i>-You know, because he's compensating.</i>
<i>-For his guilt, I mean.</i>

305
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,644
<i>[Chloe] Well, I thought...</i>

306
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,145
<i>okay, well, never mind.</i>

307
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,650
<i>So you think that he's hosting charity</i>
<i>regattas because he's feeling guilty?</i>

308
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,568
<i>Yes.</i>

309
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,905
<i>For doing bad things, like betraying</i>
<i>a beloved and totally innocent coworker.</i>

310
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,409
<i>You know, </i>
<i>maybe you and Anders are similar.</i>

311
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,662
<i>Rich, famous.</i>
<i>At the very least, notorious.</i>

312
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,498
<i>No, no, you're supposed to be Brody</i>
<i>in this metaphor.</i>

313
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,961
<i>Have you ever considered donating</i>
<i>any of your vast fortune to charity?</i>

314
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:39,920
<i>[scoffs]</i>

315
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,882
<i>I've put many a nubile law student</i>
<i>through college, thank you very much,</i>

316
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,426
<i>several of which were named Charity, so...</i>

317
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,972
<i>[Chloe] Ah, hard to believe </i>
<i>a guy so dedicated to saving the world</i>

318
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,307
<i>would murder his own employee.</i>

319
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,102
<i>Well, sometimes betrayal</i>
<i>come from the ones we expect the least,</i>

320
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,395
<i>doesn't it, Detective?</i>

321
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,315
<i>[Lucifer shouts] You!</i>

322
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,108
<i>Anders Brody.</i>

323
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,568
<i>You killed her, didn't you?</i>

324
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,528
<i>Killed? Who?</i>

325
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,947
<i>-[bottle splashes]</i>
<i>-Susan Ochoa.</i>

326
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,658
<i>You went round to her place</i>
<i>and murdered her in cold blood.</i>

327
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,743
<i>[Anders scoffs]</i>

328
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,786
<i>Are you out of your mind? Who are you?</i>

329
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,248
<i>LAPD. We're here investigating the murder</i>
<i>of your employee Susan Ochoa.</i>

330
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,166
<i>Look...</i>

331
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,501
<i>I don't even know who that is, so...</i>

332
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,129
<i>-I certainly didn't kill her.</i>
<i>-[Chloe] What happened?</i>

333
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,090
<i>You go over to her place,</i>
<i>try and put the moves on her?</i>

334
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,551
<i>She wasn't into it, you couldn't take it</i>
<i>and killed her?</i>

335
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,803
<i>I don't know her.</i>

336
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,597
<i>We know about the flowers.</i>

337
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,766
<i>They tracked back to you.</i>

338
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,726
<i>[Lucifer] Don't think so!</i>

339
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,770
<i>[Chloe] Lucifer, what are you doing?</i>

340
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,647
<i>-[rope whips]</i>
<i>-[Anders groans]</i>

341
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,357
<i>-[grunts]</i>
<i>-[rope whips]</i>

342
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,068
<i>-[engine starts]</i>
<i>-[grunts]</i>

343
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,028
<i>Susan invited you into her home...</i>

344
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,154
<i>[Anders groans]</i>

345
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,156
<i>...her life, and you betrayed her.</i>

346
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,284
<i>Do something! He's going to kill me!</i>

347
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:56,205
<i>Lucifer, there may be a less violent way</i>
<i>of getting him to talk.</i>

348
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,915
<i>Okay. Alright, alright, alright.</i>

349
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,500
<i>I betrayed Susan.</i>

350
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,627
<i>[Anders gasps]</i>

351
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,128
<i>But it's not what you think.</i>

352
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,338
<i>Please.</i>

353
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,006
<i>-[Lucifer] Fine.</i>
<i>-[snap]</i>

354
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,257
<i>-[Anders gasps]</i>
<i>-[thud]</i>

00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,718
<i>[Anders coughs]</i>

356
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,304
<i>Thank you for your honesty.</i>
<i>I like honesty.</i>

357
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,140
<i>Now, if you wouldn't mind sharing with us</i>

358
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,477
<i>a sympathetic and logical explanation</i>
<i>for your betrayal.</i>

359
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,854
<i>Not another word without my lawyers.</i>

360
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,107
<i>[Anders pants]</i>

361
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,278
<i>Is it true that human spawn</i>
<i>erupt from their mothers' bodies</i>

362
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,198
<i>in a ceremony of blood and pain?</i>

363
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,076
<i>What? No.</i>

364
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,786
<i>[sighs] In hell...</i>

365
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,788
<i>torture via birth was a favorite.</i>

366
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,124
<i>If half of what we did is accurate...</i>

367
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,626
<i>your sex holes are never going back</i>
<i>to normal.</i>

368
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,294
<i>Okay, Maze, erm...</i>

369
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,463
<i>That's enough, thank you.</i>

370
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,717
<i>And the birth is many, many...</i>

371
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,678
<i>many months from now.</i>

372
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,555
<i>[Maze] Yeah, but I have questions, Linda.</i>

373
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,307
<i>Things I don't want to know,</i>
<i>things I need to know.</i>

374
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,978
<i>And there will be plenty of time</i>
<i>to have all of your questions answered</i>

375
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,312
<i>by someone else.</i>

376
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,859
<i>But it's just too soon</i>
<i>to be dealing with all of... this.</i>

377
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,445
<i>And, besides, I have a client</i>
<i>that should be arriving any minute.</i>

378
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,613
<i>Whatever. You're lying.</i>

379
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,741
<i>This is your lunch hour,</i>

380
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,077
<i>where you eat your lunch and...</i>
<i>ogle hot guys on Tinder.</i>

381
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,829
<i>Of course, pretty soon,</i>

382
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:22,374
<i>you'll be using this hour</i>
<i>attached to one of those milking devices.</i>

383
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,460
<i>Oh-wah, oh-wah...</i>

384
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,253
<i>[laughs] We used to use those too.</i>

385
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,424
<i>In fact, we hooked this guy up to it once.</i>
<i>It was--</i>

386
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,550
<i>Okay, goodbye, Maze.</i>

387
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,844
<i>Okay.</i>

388
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,598
<i>[door clicks]</i>

389
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,557
<i>[sighs]</i>

390
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,604
<i>That must have been such a relief</i>
<i>for him to come clean.</i>

391
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:49,109
<i>Who knows? Maybe next time we try to</i>
<i>get him to confess in a less violent way.</i>

392
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,652
<i>Where's the fun in that?</i>

393
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,531
<i>At the very least, next time maybe we...</i>

394
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,201
<i>try and get him to confess</i>
<i>more specifically.</i>

395
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,453
<i>"I betrayed her," </i>
<i>can mean a lot of things.</i>

396
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,997
<i>You're right. You're right.</i>

397
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,209
<i>Maybe we should brainstorm</i>
<i>a list of betrayals. You start, Detective.</i>

398
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,960
<i>[phone rings]</i>

399
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,878
<i>Oh.</i>

400
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,338
<i>Hey, Ella. What's up?</i>

401
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,007
<i>Anders Brody didn't kill Susan Ochoa.</i>

402
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,093
<i>[Chloe] </i><span style="style2">What? How do you know that? </i>

403
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,514
<i>Because, while Brody's been in custody,</i>
<i>the real killer just struck again.</i>

404
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,687
<i>[Ella] Victim's name is David Ramirez.</i>

405
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,649
<i>27, apprentice mechanic, </i>
<i>lived in the back of the shop.</i>

406
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,111
<i>-[Chloe] Is this what I think it is?</i>
<i>-[Ella] Yep.</i>

407
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:37,074
<i>Tattoos that were removed</i>
<i>and their designs look like...</i>

408
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,992
<i>[Dan] Los X's gang tats.</i>

409
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,411
<i>Apparently Ramirez grew up</i>
<i>in foster homes,</i>

410
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,331
<i>he got mixed up with the wrong crowd,</i>
<i>got arrested a bunch of times,</i>

411
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,707
<i>but, four years ago,</i>

412
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,877
<i>he goes to night school,</i>
<i>gets his mechanic certification</i>

413
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,337
<i>and he's been clean ever since.</i>

414
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,131
<i>[slaps file] Damn it.</i>

415
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,882
<i>-What's wrong?</i>
<i>-He's just...</i>

416
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,800
<i>[hits desk]</i>

417
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,885
<i>Just trying to clean up his life,</i>
<i>you know, like...</i>

418
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,428
<i>Susan Ochoa.</i>

419
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,014
<i>Okay, let's focus on the things</i>
<i>we can control,</i>

420
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,392
<i>like stopping the killer</i>
<i>from striking again.</i>

421
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>We know that all the victims were linked</i>
<i>by their former gang,</i>

422
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,523
<i>so maybe it's someone from their past.</i>
<i>But what's the motive?</i>

423
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,483
<i>Retribution maybe.</i>

424
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,695
<i>Well, then let's talk to the former crew,</i>
<i>see if anyone knows anything.</i>

425
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,240
<i>Los Xs aren't dumb corner boys anymore.</i>
<i>They're a major drug operation.</i>

426
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,159
<i>Which means they have lawyers,</i>

427
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,995
<i>and without air-tight warrants</i>
<i>or full SWAT backup...</i>

428
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,288
<i>they'll stonewall us.</i>

429
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,165
<i>You're absolutely right,</i>
<i>so I'll call a judge,</i>

430
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,292
<i>get a warrant. </i>
<i>That might take a couple of days.</i>

431
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,920
<i>But... Dan, I know what this is about,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

432
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,090
<i>There's nothing we can do</i>
<i>until we get a warrant.</i>

433
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,842
<i>Okay.</i>

434
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,679
<i>Has anyone seen Lucifer?</i>

435
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,431
<i>[door opens]</i>

436
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,849
<i>[Lucifer] I'll take it from here.</i>

437
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,976
<i>-No, don't touch me!</i>
<i>-I'll take it from here.</i>

438
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,813
<i>Relax, your neck is fine.</i>
<i>It's your guilt I want to get a grip on.</i>

439
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,651
<i>You said you betrayed Susan, so if you</i>
<i>didn't kill her, what did you do?</i>

440
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,778
<i>Look, I think it's best</i>
<i>if you just speak with my--</i>

441
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,073
<i>You went to Susan's that evening</i>
<i>for a reason, so tell me.</i>

442
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,451
<i>What did you desire?</i>

443
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,287
<i>I wanted...</i>

444
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,122
<i>Mm?</i>

445
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,666
<i>I wanted...</i>

446
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,293
<i>forgiveness.</i>

447
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,962
<i>Forgiveness? Why?</i>

448
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,257
<i>One day I came upon Susan</i>

449
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,843
<i>as she was talking</i>
<i>to some at-risk youth group</i>

450
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,804
<i>about her past,</i>
<i>her struggles with addiction.</i>

451
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,224
<i>I had no idea and I panicked.</i>

452
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,808
<i>Imagine the PR crisis.</i>

453
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,186
<i>Head of Safety Protocols, a drug addict.</i>

454
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,065
<i>So I demoted her,</i>
<i>took her off the NASA project.</i>

455
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,943
<i>You punished her for her former life.</i>

456
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,153
<i>But then I went through her file</i>

457
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,949
<i>and I found that Susan</i>
<i>was a model employee</i>

458
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,577
<i>and she'd passed every single drug test,</i>
<i>including the one last week.</i>

459
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,998
<i>-It wasn't right, what I did to her.</i>
<i>-So you went over to apologize.</i>

460
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,167
<i>But when I got there, it was too late.</i>

461
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,254
<i>[sighs]</i>

462
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,421
<i>She was dead.</i>

463
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,883
<i>I was wrong.</i>

464
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,803
<i>Oh.</i>

465
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,721
<i>[Anders] Never said that before.</i>

466
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,266
<i>[Anders sighs]</i>

467
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,433
<i>It feels good, man.</i>

468
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,686
<i>It feels real good.</i>

469
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,938
<i>I'm sure it does.</i>

470
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,232
<i>Anyway...</i>

471
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:16,984
<i>you're free to go.</i>

472
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,403
<i>Thanks.</i>

473
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,450
<i>Were you just hugging Anders Brody?</i>

474
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,577
<i>Whatever it takes to get answers,</i>
<i>Detective.</i>

475
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,578
<i>Huh!</i>

476
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,080
<i>That's very evolved of you.</i>

477
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,039
<i>Mm.</i>

478
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,250
<i>Well, we're still waiting on warrants</i>

479
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,544
<i>and we can't do anything on the case</i>
<i>until tomorrow,</i>

480
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,421
<i>so our night's free.</i>

481
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,714
<i>Go on.</i>

482
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,633
<i>Well, I thought</i>
<i>that maybe we could meet up later.</i>

483
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,427
<i>And, er...</i>

484
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,929
<i>You know, not exactly a date, but...</i>

485
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,848
<i>maybe something better.</i>

486
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,143
<i>Well, it sounds like you have something</i>
<i>very particular in mind.</i>

487
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,112
<i>See you next week. </i>

488
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,074
<i>Amenadiel.</i>

489
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,492
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

490
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,077
<i>I brought you some things.</i>

491
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,414
<i>Stuff that could help you out</i>
<i>during this time.</i>

492
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,710
<i>That's so nice of you,</i>
<i>but I don't need anything.</i>

493
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,504
<i>Linda, listen, I want to be here for you,</i>
<i>alright?</i>

494
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,258
<i>So I figured that this would be</i>
<i>a good way for us to start.</i>

495
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,553
<i>Now...</i>

496
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,097
<i>let's do this.</i>

497
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,225
<i>This one's good, because this Dr. Spock...</i>

498
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,686
<i>he seems to know the most about babies.</i>

499
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,272
<i>This one shows the baby</i>

500
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,358
<i>that all animals poop.</i>

501
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,780
<i>I'm not really sure</i>
<i>why the baby would need to know that.</i>

502
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,366
<i>This one is good...</i>

503
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,202
{\an8}<i>because it tells you what to do</i>
<i>when a baby is crying.</i>

504
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,245
{\an8}<i>Although maybe you don't need this one.</i>

505
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,706
{\an8}<i>I overheard at least three people</i>
<i>crying in here today</i>

506
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,459
<i>-and you handled it like a pro--</i>
<i>-It's too soon.</i>

507
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,088
<i>Honestly.</i>

508
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,967
<i>It's very kind of you and I appreciate</i>
<i>the gesture, I really do...</i>

509
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,095
<i>but I...</i>

510
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,766
<i>I told you you were the father</i>
<i>because you deserved to know.</i>

511
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,269
<i>Not to pressure you into helping out.</i>

512
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,605
<i>The truth is</i>
<i>I'm used to doing things on my own.</i>

513
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,359
<i>I don't see why raising a baby</i>
<i>should be any different.</i>

514
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,611
<i>I just wanted to help.</i>

515
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,279
<i>You don't need to worry about me.</i>

516
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,991
<i>And you, I...</i>

517
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,785
<i>I would love to talk, but,</i>

518
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,122
<i>unfortunately, I have a ton of paperwork</i>
<i>to do before my next client, so...</i>

519
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,248
<i>Right.</i>

520
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,334
<i>I'll get out of your way.</i>

521
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,010
<i>I like that one.</i>

522
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,221
<i>[Maze]</i>
<i>Really? Not the one I would have chosen,</i>

523
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,390
<i>but you are the closest person to a baby</i>
<i>I know.</i>

524
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,060
<i>Okay, so at what age did your parents</i>
<i>teach you to hunt?</i>

525
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,063
<i>[Dan] What's going on? Maze, you know</i>
<i>she's not allowed to play with knives.</i>

526
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,191
<i>Relax, Dan,</i>
<i>these knives aren't for Trixie.</i>

527
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,277
<i>They're for a baby.</i>

528
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,530
<i>Okay, new rule.</i>

529
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,617
<i>No more knife play of any kind</i>
<i>with my kid. You got it?</i>

530
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,953
<i>-Fine.</i>
<i>-Trixie, it's time to go.</i>

531
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,163
<i>Grab your stuff.</i>

532
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,874
<i>So who pissed in your Cheerios?</i>

533
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,792
<i>You're even grumpier than usual.</i>

534
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,087
<i>It's the case, okay? I feel powerless.</i>

535
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,339
<i>Any second now,</i>
<i>another person could get killed </i>

536
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,884
<i>and we're just...</i>
<i>we're sitting on our asses.</i>

537
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,386
<i>-Why?</i>
<i>-Because we've got to wait for a judge</i>

538
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,888
<i>to give us a stupid warrant.</i>

539
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,559
<i>Says who?</i>

540
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,780
<i>Mr. Morningstar,</i>
<i>thank you for reaching out.</i>

541
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:51,948
<i>Are you okay?</i>

542
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,035
<i>Did Detective Decker...</i>
<i>Did she do something?</i>

543
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:55,952
<i>No.</i>

544
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,412
<i>And she never will.</i>

545
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,332
<i>I'm just here to tell you</i>
<i>that you're wrong about the Detective.</i>

546
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,876
<i>If she's planning anything,</i>
<i>it's an apology.</i>

547
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,171
<i>I certainly hope that that's the case.</i>

548
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,798
<i>Oh, ye of little faith, Father.</i>

549
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,719
<i>Have you noticed her carrying a vial?</i>

550
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,430
<i>A what?</i>

551
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,641
<i>[Father] A vial. It's a...</i>

552
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,310
<i>An ornate thing.</i>
<i>It's about the size of a plum.</i>

553
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,481
<i>I got word from a colleague of mine</i>
<i>in Rome that she'd met with a priest</i>

554
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,651
<i>who was hell-bent</i>
<i>on banishing the devil from Earth.</i>

555
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,321
<i>And you all get paid to do this?</i>
<i>I'm genuinely asking.</i>

556
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,742
<i>Supposedly, this priest has uncovered</i>
<i>a ceremony that would, and bear with me...</i>

557
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,120
<i>trap the devil in hell for all eternity.</i>

558
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,749
<i>He shared the details of this ceremony</i>
<i>with Chloe.</i>

559
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,584
<i>[giggles]</i>

560
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:49,422
<i>A ceremony to banish the devil to hell?</i>
<i>That is priceless. Ha-ha!</i>

561
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,382
<i>No, seriously,</i>

562
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:54,135
<i>you all need to take </i><span style="style2">End of Days</i>
<i>out of the Vatican movie night rotation.</i>

563
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,763
<i>Definitely not one of Arnold's best.</i>

564
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,681
<i>I know.</i>

565
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,140
<i>I know it sounds crazy.</i>

566
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:03,103
<i>But Chloe was very distressed</i>
<i>last time I saw her.</i>

567
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,732
<i>Apparently, the ceremony involves</i>
<i>giving the subject a sacramental liquid...</i>

568
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,651
<i>that would sedate the devil.</i>

569
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,987
<i>Ooh, let me guess.</i>

570
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,697
<i>It's inside the plum vial.</i>

571
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,031
<i>So I'm told.</i>

572
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,910
<i>And if it would sedate the devil,</i>
<i>I fear that it involves some poison.</i>

573
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,955
<i>Something that would kill a normal man.</i>

574
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,957
<i>You're incorrigible, aren't you?</i>

575
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,751
<i>Do you honestly think</i>
<i>that I would travel thousands of miles,</i>

576
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,046
<i>tell you these outlandish tales,</i>
<i>if I didn't take them seriously?</i>

577
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,174
<i>I hope beyond hope that I am wrong.</i>

578
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,636
<i>But if there is any chance</i>
<i>that Chloe could try something,</i>

579
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,680
<i>you need to be careful.</i>

580
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,641
<i>Well, consider me warned.</i>

581
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,520
<i>You may absolve yourself of any further</i>
<i>responsibility in this matter.</i>

582
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,105
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me...</i>

583
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:48,898
<i>I have plans.</i>

584
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:56,906
<i>[door rattles]</i>

585
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,659
<i>Is that the man?</i>

586
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,786
<i>Not a man, Your Excellency.</i>

587
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,331
<i>The prophecy is real.</i>

588
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,459
<i>And now that the trap is set...</i>

589
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,795
<i>everything will come together soon.</i>

590
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,225
<i>I hope this so-called surprise of yours</i>
<i>doesn't involve me taking off my shoes.</i>

591
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,812
<i>I should warn you</i>
<i>that what I have planned...</i>

592
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,273
<i>might be painful for you, but...</i>

593
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,318
<i>I think, ultimately,</i>
<i>you'll see it's a good thing.</i>

594
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,486
<i>Painful?</i>

595
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,613
<i>Detective,</i>
<i>what on Earth are you talking about?</i>

596
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,281
<i>It's just up ahead.</i>

597
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:39,908
<i>What is? </i>

598
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,704
<i>Just... forgive me.</i>

599
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:47,749
<i>Detective...</i>

600
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,293
<i>where are you taking me?</i>

<i>What's up, fellas?</i>

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,308
<i>[door bangs shut]</i>

606
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,312
<i>Do you have any idea where you are?</i>

607
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,147
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

<i>[Dan laughs] Come on, guys, relax.</i>

00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,614
<i>That's not why I'm here, okay?</i>

612
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,909
<i>Susan Ochoa and David Ramirez</i>
<i>were murdered.</i>

<i>And I know you guys are involved somehow.</i>

614

<i>So I need to talk to the guy or the girl</i>
<i>who's in charge.</i>

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,348
<i>Okay. Alright.</i>
