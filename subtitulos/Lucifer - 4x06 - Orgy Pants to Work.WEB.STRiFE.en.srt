00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,501
<i>Of course, there was bound</i>
<i>to be a child eventually,</i>

327
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,504
<i>because of all the meaningless</i>
<i>sexual encounters.</i>

328
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,631
<i>I wouldn't say they were meaningless.</i>

329
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,426
<i>Please. Our brother Lucifer is a...</i>
<i>What do they call it here?</i>

330
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:10,970
<i>A slut.</i>

331
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:11,929
<i>Lucifer?</i>

332
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,934
<i>You're here because you think</i>
<i>Lucifer has fathered a half-human child?</i>

333
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,560
<i>[Remy] Must have been difficult for you.</i>

334
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,939
<i>Bearing the burden of Lucifer secret alone</i>
<i>in order to protect him.</i>

335
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,899
<i>But I'm here now, brother.</i>

336
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,568
<i>Together, we can put an end</i>
<i>to this madness.</i>

337
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,153
<i>Oh whoa, whoa, Remy.</i>

338
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,074
<i>What do you mean exactly by</i>
<i>"put an end to it"?</i>

339
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,409
<i>As we both know,</i>

340
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:38,706
<i>it's forbidden for humans and celestials</i>
<i>to intermingle in an amorous manner.</i>

341
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,457
<i>The child shouldn't exist.</i>

342
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,792
<i>The child is innocent.</i>

343
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,670
<i>Exactly! Which is why</i>
<i>we must find the child,</i>

344
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,798
<i>snatch it up and take it to Heaven</i>
<i>for the rest of eternity.</i>

345
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,841
<i>[thud]</i>

346
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,759
<i>Remy, put your wings away!</i>

347
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,055
<i>Humans aren't supposed to see them.</i>

348
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,098
<i>Right!</i>

349
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,349
<i>I forgot!</i>

350
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,437
<i>Please slow time so these barely sentient</i>
<i>creatures won't see us fly away.</i>

351
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,397
<i>Well, I can't slow time.</i>

352
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,569
<i>Because that would be too easy.</i>

353
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,156
<i>Look, this is our first</i>
<i>brother-sister hunt in over a millennia.</i>

354
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,199
<i>Why not make it a proper challenge?</i>

355
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,325
<i>[laughs]</i>

356
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,285
<i>You are right!</i>

357
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,703
<i>To the challenge!</i>

358
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,583
<i>Where might we find</i>
<i>the kind of human woman</i>

359
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,251
<i>that Lucifer would impregnate?</i>

360
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,544
<i>Actually...</i>

361
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,254
<i>I know exactly where to start.</i>

362
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,925
<i>But... perhaps we should begin</i>
<i>with a change of clothes.</i>

363
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:42,853
<i>[sighs]</i>

364
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,857
<i>Lucifer, I'm sorry</i>
<i>that I was hard on you before.</i>

365
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,358
<i>You know, we...</i>

366
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,195
<i>We all have our personal lives</i>

367
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,073
<i>and I go to parent-teacher conferences</i>

368
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,617
<i>and you host sex parties, so...</i>

369
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,577
<i>To each their own.</i>

370
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,082
<i>Look, as long as you continue to wear</i>
<i>actual pants to work...</i>

371
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,586
<i>then, if you're happy, I'm happy.</i>

372
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,925
<i>[Lucifer snores]</i>

373
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,678
<i>[Lucifer snores]</i>

374
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,310
<i>[Lucifer snores]</i>

375
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,770
<i>You know, I'm not happy.</i>

376
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,523
<i>Of course...</i>

377
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,858
<i>I want you to be happy.</i>

378
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,026
<i>But the way...</i>

379
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,862
<i>that you are happy...</i>

380
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,990
<i>It makes me uncomfortable.</i>

381
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,494
<i>It makes me feel sick, to be honest.</i>

382
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,955
<i>And yes, sometimes it makes me jealous.</i>

383
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,248
<i>So...</i>

384
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,585
<i>I hate the way you are happy.</i>

385
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,381
<i>And...</i>

386
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,216
<i>there it is.</i>

387
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,601
<i>[smacks]</i>

388
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,395
<i>[clears throat] Fetch me the goat!</i>

389
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,816
<i>No, in the hat.</i>

390
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,818
<i>We need to make sure this is the guy.</i>

391
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,029
<i>[footsteps]</i>

392
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,073
<i>[woman screams]</i>

393
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,992
<i>I think he is the guy.</i>

394
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,039
<i>[screaming] Help! Fire! No, no!</i>

395
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,209
<i>There you go. Big, strong donkey kicks.</i>
<i>Now locate the trunk release.</i>

396
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,170
<i>[Chloe] LAPD. Step away from the victim!</i>

397
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,964
<i>And stop... giving her notes?</i>

398
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,134
<i>Vincent Walker.</i>

399
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,720
<i>You mind? We're kind of</i>
<i>in the middle of something here.</i>

400
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,513
<i>[lady] Is this a part of the scenario?</i>

401
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,266
<i>[lady] 'Cause we haven't done </i>
<i>crossfire drills yet.</i>

402
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,767
<i>I need to give it a shot.</i>

403
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,520
<i>[Vincent] You can put the gun away,</i>
<i>detective. I run a K and R outfit.</i>

404
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,730
<i>Kidnap and ransom.</i>

405
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,064
<i>[slams trunk]</i>

406
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,568
<i>We offer abduction survival courses</i>
<i>for frequent travelers like Joyce here.</i>

407
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,486
<i>[Joyce]</i>
<i>They are the best in the business.</i>

408
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,574
<i>My employer pays for everybody</i>
<i>in the Bogota office</i>

409
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,492
<i>to get kidnapped at least once.</i>

410
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,453
<i>[mouths] It's my third time.</i>

411
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,121
<i>Quite a thrill-seeker, aren't you?</i>

412
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,333
<i>Okay, who payed you to kidnap</i>
<i>Gary Van Blunt?</i>

413
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,002
<i>As usual, you cops have it all wrong.</i>

414
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,172
<i>Our parent company payed Mr. Van Blunt</i>
<i>to audit us.</i>

415
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,716
<i>That was a formality.</i>
<i>Typical government red tape.</i>

416
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,011
<i>Then he accused me of paying off</i>
<i>Bolivian border guards.</i>

417
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,846
<i>-And were you?</i>
<i>-Of course he was.</i>

418
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,015
<i>[Vincent] Damn right I was.</i>
<i>To keep my clients safe.</i>

419
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,433
<i>Everyone in my line of work does.</i>

420
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:30,479
<i>I told Gary his goody two shoes routine</i>
<i>could cost real people their lives,</i>

421
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,648
<i>-but he wouldn't listen.</i>
<i>-So, you murdered him.</i>

422
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,316
<i>What? No.</i>

423
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,776
<i>I tailed him a little.</i>

424
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,694
<i>Hoped to scare him into shutting up.</i>

425
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,321
<i>From home to work and not much else.</i>

426
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,407
<i>The poor sav was the human equivalent</i>
<i>of watching paint dry.</i>

427
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,662
<i>Until he wasn't.</i>
<i>Couple of days ago he breaks routine.</i>

428
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,122
<i>Takes off in a Malibu Canyon. I lost him.</i>

429
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,791
<i>Cops pulled me over for speeding.</i>

430
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,502
<i>And I suppose you have an alibi</i>
<i>for last night at 12:30.</i>

431
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,005
<i>As it happens, I was on</i>
<i>a three-day mission to Cape Town.</i>

432
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,049
<i>Flew into LAX a couple of hours ago.</i>

433
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:00,717
<i>Are we good?</i>

434
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,552
<i>Mm-hmm. Okay.</i>

435
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,349
<i>Well, that was a bust.</i>

436
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,102
<i>But now we know how Gary spent</i>
<i>the last day of his life.</i>

437
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,063
<i>In the 5,800 acres of Malibu Canyon.</i>

438
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,440
<i>Alright,</i>
<i>I'm going to go back to the precinct.</i>

439
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,611
<i>I'm going to work up a list of what homes</i>
<i>and businesses we canvas first.</i>

440
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,364
<i>Why don't you go home and get some sleep?</i>

441
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,366
<i>Nonsense, detective. </i>
<i>I've already had my cat nap.</i>

442
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,576
<i>I insist you go home and get some rest</i>

443
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,912
<i>and I'll burn the midnight oil</i>
<i>at the station.</i>

444
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,873
<i>You're offering to do hours</i>
<i>of tedious research?</i>

445
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:36,420
<i>I want to do whatever it takes</i>
<i>to secure justice for poor boring Gary.</i>

446
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,048
<i>Detective, recent missteps aside,</i>
<i>you should know,</i>

447
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,303
<i>when I'm on the job,</i>
<i>the job has my complete devotion.</i>

448
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,513
<i>Thank you, Lucifer.</i>

449
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,432
<i>That means a lot.</i>

450
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,561
<i>So, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

451
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,146
<i>Bright and early.</i>

452
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,533
<i>[both giggling]</i>

453
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,498
<i>Oh, girl, don't even start.</i>

<i>[Eve] It's just that when he leaves me</i>

456
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,472
<i>You know I was his second wife, right?</i>

457
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,308
<i>Literally created for the guy</i>

00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:35,228

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

464

<i>My God. I'm so sorry.</i>

465
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,545
<i>I completely forgot</i>

<i>That's why this young lady</i>

<i>Oh, don't worry. We know.</i>

00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,410
<i>He even offered to help us all</i>

538
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,633
<i>Did Gary have anyone he butted heads with</i>
<i>in the community?</i>

539
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,762
<i>Oh, Gary didn't have a contrary bone</i>
<i>in his naked butt.</i>

540
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,016
<i>I can't imagine him saying</i>

<i>[guy] Except maybe to Julian. Remember?</i>

542
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,187
<i>We saw them arguing</i>

<i>I couldn't understand exactly</i>

<i>I didn't have my hearing aids in.</i>

545

<i>[guy] Julian inherited this place</i>

552

<i>Oh, hey...</i>

565
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,247
<i>I wanted to say how sorry I was</i>
<i>when I heard about Gary.</i>

566
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,917
<i>He is going to be missed</i>
<i>by the entire community.</i>

567

<i>Cut the crap.</i>

00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,129
<i>We know you two argued</i>

569

00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,219
<i>I hate to speak ill of the dead,</i>

571
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,555

<i>making them uncomfortable.</i>

574
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,105
<i>So I had to give him some firm advice.</i>

575
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,899
<i>Probably did him a favour, honestly.</i>

576
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,776
<i>How altruistic of you.</i>

577
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,862
<i>My point is that the last time I saw Gary,</i>

578
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,825
<i>he was alive, and well,</i>
<i>and still trying to bat out of his league.</i>

<i>Well, Remy...</i>

597
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:14,711
<i>Perhaps Lucifer discovered</i>

<i>greedy and smelly.</i>

599
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,717
