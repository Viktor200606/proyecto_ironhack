How's it going, Frank?

00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:21,717
You still kicking
that hernia's butt?

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,674
Nice.

00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,111
Morning, Jane.

00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:26,156
Talk about a buzzer-beater
last night, am I right?

00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,244
Bam!

Hey, guys.

13
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:29,551
Morning.

14
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:34,034
Oh, I like your hair today.Thank you.

15
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:42,085
Tough break, Beth.

00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:45,697

what happened to you.

Hey, little brother.

20
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,664
You did what?

21
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:57,840
They said that?

22
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:00,234
Well, that's never gonna happen.

23
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,410
Seriously?

24
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:04,281
Fine, okay.

Dude.

27
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:09,417
What are you doing?

28
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,158
Well, this macro lens
gets so much more detail

29
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:12,637
than my phone
camera does.Gross.

30
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,726
Oh, someone's
a crabby-pants today.

31
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,119
How's it going, Ella?

32
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,207
Couldn't be better.

33
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,730
Really?

34
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:21,864
Sorry, my brother just called.

35
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,909
Ah, right.
Well, family are the worst.

36
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:25,389
Crab away.Well, apparently,

37
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:29,132
uh, my brother moved back
to Detroit a week ago.

38
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,308
And did he bother to
give me a heads-up?

39
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:32,396
Uh, no, señor.

40
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,745
Not to mention
that he's the reason

41
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,356
I moved out to L.A.
in the first place.

42
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,794
And now my whole family wants me
to move back home, too.

43
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:43,886
Are you considering
moving back home?

44
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,107
Well, I mean, you guys know
how much I love it here, but...

45
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,630
they're my family.

46
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:50,458
So, you know, yeah.

47
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,982
Well, Ella, you know, I'm... I'm
trying to be supportive, but...

48
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,332
Well, I'm not.
Don't you dare go.

49
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,334
I may not have a choice.

50
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:58,857
Everyone has a choice, Ms. Lo...

51
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,817
Anyhoo, um,
so much going on here.

52
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,340
Let me show you.Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:05,951
This right here is Dr. Beth
Daly, child psychiatrist.

54
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:07,127
CHLOE:
Looks like blunt force trauma.

55
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,911
Someone hit her over the head?

56
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:12,654
Yes, and yes, but there's
so much more to it than that.

57
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:16,048
From what I can tell,
the killer was standing here

58
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,876
when they grabbed
their murder weapon.

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,052
You see this spot in the dust,
right here?

60
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,185
Fallen books,
and only one bookend.

61
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,665
So she was killed with
the missing bookend?

62
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,146
Mm, yes and no.
So the bookend...

63
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,756
[imitates impact]
made her woozy, right?

64
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:32,543
And then, she stumbled,
slipped on this toy train,

65
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:35,677
grabbed this chair, fell back,

66
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,855
hit her head on this table and
bang, that's what killed her.

67
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:41,422
Oh, bravo, Ms. Lopez.
See, that's another reason

68
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:42,684
why you shouldn't leave.

69
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:44,207
Crime scenes would be
so dull without you.

70
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,427
Thank you.
But wait, there's more.

71
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,342
There always is.I found

72
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:51,519
a weird clump of hair
under Beth's nails.

73
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,130
It's all gunky, too.Is that blood?

74
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,524
Mm, I can't really tell yet,
there's not enough of it.

75
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,221
I got to get it
back to the lab.

76
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,354
CHLOE:
Hmm. Oh.

77
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:03,705
Well, looks like there's a smear
here, like somebody tried

78
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,533
to wipe away some blood.

79
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,056
ELLA:
Good eye.

80
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,623
I'm thinking maybe the
girl who called it in?

81
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,842
Yeah.
Beckett Wilson.

82
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,366
She was the doctor's
next patient.

83
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:15,238
She found the body,
she was pretty shaken up.

84
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,935
Talk about shock therapy.

85
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,242
Well, I mean, wiping
blood off the wound

86
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:21,549
is consistent with someone
who cares about the victim.

87
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:24,029
Well, Dan took Beckett to
the precinct to calm her down,

88
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,248
so I'll go check in with them.

89
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,815
Okay, and I'll check
in with the lab,

90
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,382
see if they can
rush this hair.
Great.

91
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:29,687
All right.

92
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,950
I will check in
with the nearest pharmacy.

93
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:34,431
DAN: No, she still
isn't talking.

94
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:37,042
Poor kid's pretty traumatized.

95
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:41,830
No, I don't see any blood
on her hands or her clothes.

96
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,614
I'll ask her.

97
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:45,094
Bye.

98
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,748
[beeps]

99
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,271
[clears throat]

100
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,361
Hey, Beckett?

101
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,059
When you found the body,

102
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:57,454
did you maybe try to
wipe up any blood?

103
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:01,023
I don't think I did.

104
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:04,461
But it's all so fuzzy.

105
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:07,116
Hey, it's okay.

106
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,639
[sniffles]

107
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:09,988
We'll just talk later.

108
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:15,298
Is there anything
I can do now?

109
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,082
[sniffles]

110
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:19,302
A Slurpee would be nice.

111
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:22,697
A Slurpee it is.

112
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,873
See you, Frank.You, too.

113
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,318
What's this?

114
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:54,163
ANTHONY:
You don't possibly think
my son could've done this.

115
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,818
No, Mr. Rodriguez,
Felix is not a suspect.

116
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,646
He doesn't fit the
forensic's profile.

117
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:01,170
However, we did look
at Beth's appointment book,

118
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,520
and he was scheduled
for much earlier this morning.

119
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:06,001
So do you have any idea
why he was still here?

120
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:07,481
Of course I do.

121
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,526
He brought his violin
to his appointment this morning,

122
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,832
and he left it there.

123
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,355
The office isn't far
from our house,

124
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,531
so I let him ride his bike
back to get it.

125
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:18,143
Well, we think Felix got here
shortly after Beth was killed.

126
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:20,537
So we'd like to speak to him,
see if he saw anything.

127
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:23,366
Well, that might be tough.

128
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,891
Uh, Felix is... shy.

129
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:29,416
He struggles
with communication,

130
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,852
social skills.

131
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:32,636
That's why he was
seeing Dr. Beth.

132
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,985
Mm.

133
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,291
I don't know
what we're gonna do without her.

134
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,598
I mean, she's helped
Felix so much.

135
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,339
He's thriving
in school,

136
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:44,213
he's got all kinds of new
friends and-and interests.

137
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:47,434
He's like a totally
different kid.

138
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:50,393
He's just still not
very open with strangers.

139
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:52,482
I see.

140
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,094
Hey, buddy.

141
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,053
Can I help you get that off?

142
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:06,801
You know, when I
was about your age,

143
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:08,977
I was in a car accident.

144
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,283
It was pretty bad.

145
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:16,419
I saw lots and
lots of blood.

146
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:20,118
I know how scary
it can be.

147
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:24,340
But you're gonna be okay.

148
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,256
I promise.

149
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,781
[whispers]:
I didn't see who did it.

150
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,567
Okay. Thanks for telling me.

151
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:37,788
Oh, my gosh, mijito,
are you okay?

152
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,487
What happened?Hey, let's just get
Felix home right now.

153
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,141
I'll explain everything
when we've all calmed down.

154
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,622
Here's my card.

155
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,582
If Felix thinks of anything
else, or mentions anything,

156
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,105
please, feel free to call me.

157
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,411
All right.
Thank you.

158
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:02,986
Well, aren't you
a little strange one?

159
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,336
WOMAN [whispering]:
I know you are, but what am I?

160
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,731
Ray-Ray?

161
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:10,820
What are you doing here?

162
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,519
Now, is that any way to greet
one of your oldest friends?

163
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,477
Okay, hi.

164
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:17,348
We kind of sort of
agreed to never

165
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:19,089
see each other again.Did we?

166
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,222
I don't remember putting
such a fine point on it.

167
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:22,353
We did, we did. Super fine.

168
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:23,746
Five years ago, in Detroit?

169
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,747
I know you remember.

170
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,532
Look, I'm sorry.

171
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:28,403
I just... I miss you.

172
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:31,667
Okay, it's not that I don't
miss you, too, okay?

173
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,974
I just thought that
this part of my life was over.

174
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:35,497
The part with you in it.

175
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,107
It's just...
it's a little too weird.

176
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:39,545
Okay? So please,
just go away. Just...

177
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:42,678

remember that,

194

um, weird clump of hair
that I found on the vic?

195
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:28,724
Well, it turns out

196
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:31,597
that it's a synthetic fur,
used to make anything

197
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,513
from carpets to,
uh, plush toys.

198
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,384

under Beth's nails, right?

200

201
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,737
Nope. Turns out
that it was ketchup.

202
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:43,870
Even though there wasn't a
scrap of food in the joint.

203
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:47,090
So, uh, like I said, it
just came out of nowhere.

204
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:49,179
Do you see why
it's so annoying?

205
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:50,485
Okay, I'm gonna go
search Beth's house.

206
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,226
Maybe I'll find a match
to the fur there.

Great. Uh,
I'll join you.

frickin' special.

Okay, first of all,
I see aghost-- aghost-- you.

I did feel special, okay?

But special or not,
it's not normal.

And since when
do you care about that?

that shrink thought

235
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:55,898
that I was legitimately crazy
and put me on all those meds?

Wait. I-- okay, uh, I
didn't want to say this,

240
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:09,869
but the reason why I'm here

241
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:12,915
is to help you with,
you know, work stuff.

242
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,265
Why would a ghost want
to help me with work stuff?

00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,398
Ooh.

244

mentioned "ghost rules" before.

Well, you know,
I-I never had to.

253
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:39,202
Okay, fine, so when this case
is over, you will go away again?

But just lay low.

even notice I'm here.

for one second, man.

How could I possibly
know what she was planning?

259
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:58,914
Uh, let me get this straight,

260
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,133
you were tasked with escorting
the young lady to the precinct

261
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:03,353
and she ran away
with your phone.

262
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,703
Yes, with my phone.
Ooh!

263
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:06,922
Clearly, Beckett manipulated me,

264
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:08,401
which means she wasn't
really upset

265
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:09,576

than we thought.

where's Beckett?

524
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:04,504
Oh, that little girl
is so helpful.

525
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:06,463
She's the one who introduced
me to Gemma, actually.
Hmm.

526
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:09,596
Yeah, she just ran off to get
us a couple of churro...

527
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,511
Oh.

528
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:12,643
[Dan laughing]

529
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,863
In your face.

530
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:17,778
She read you like a book.

531
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:20,433
All day long you're making fun
of me for getting duped by a kid

532
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:21,782
and you lost her, too.[chuckles]

533
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:24,785
You lost her.

534
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:26,221
Oh, that's bad.

535
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:27,832
This is really bad.

536
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,530
Daniel, you don't happen to have
my car keys on you, do you?

537
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:33,228
What?

538
00:23:33,272 --> 00:23:36,231
She took my badge.

539
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:37,885
Oh. Well...

540
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:40,410
good news is at least
I got your phone back.

541

That little bitch.

542
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:51,638
Fingerprints on the broom
are too smudged to I.D.

543
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,858
All I got were traces
of chalk and rosin.

544
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:57,514
Rosin?
Yeah, a substance
with, like, a gajillion uses:

545
00:23:57,557 --> 00:24:01,082
adhesives, soap, chewing gum,
hard to narrow down.

546
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:02,519
I think I got something.

547
00:24:02,562 --> 00:24:04,608
This is surveillance footage

548
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,348
from the traffic light
near Beth's office.

549
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:09,482
This car sped away
after your tussle with that man

550
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:12,224
and was there during the fight
that Iris told us about.

551
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:13,486
Sweet.
Sweet.

552
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,140
Who is it?

553
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:17,882
Well, the license plate
and the driver aren't visible,

554
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:19,057
but we do have this.

555
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,363
It's a bumper sticker

556
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:22,539
from Rancho Middle School

557
00:24:22,582 --> 00:24:23,888
where Felix and
Beckett attend.

558
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:26,020
Chalk on the broom.
I-It could be a teacher.

559
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,414
I know.
Hmm?

560
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:32,462
We know that there was chalk
on the broom, right?

561
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:34,507
Could be a teacher.

562
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:35,943
Mm, maybe, but which one?

563
00:24:35,987 --> 00:24:39,251
Well, you know what else
rosin is used for?

564
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:40,774
A violin bow.

565
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:43,864
Didn't Felix leave his violin
in Beth's office?

566
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:45,300
Look up the music teacher.

567
00:24:45,344 --> 00:24:47,389
CHLOE:
There he is, Jonathan Burke.

568
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:52,394
You're good.
[laughs]

569
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:55,528
Okay. Yes, I-I was
in Beth's office,

570
00:24:55,572 --> 00:24:57,269
but I'm really sorry
I scared you.

571
00:24:57,312 --> 00:24:58,575
What were you trying to do?

572
00:24:58,618 --> 00:25:00,577
Destroy evidence that
you murdered Beth?!

573
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,885
No, no. I was, um, I was going
to retrieve this.

574
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,888
A check for five grand.

575
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:10,369
I was worried that it would
lead the police to me.

576
00:25:11,283 --> 00:25:13,111
What was the money for?

577
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:14,547
Felix is my best student.

578
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:16,462
He's the best student
I've ever seen.

579
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:18,333
The kid is destined
for stardom.

580
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:20,597
I was hoping that
he'd take me with him.

581
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,555
So, what? You were trying
to bribe Beth

582
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:25,863
because she was helping him
to spend less time on violin

583
00:25:25,906 --> 00:25:27,168
and be more social?

584
00:25:27,212 --> 00:25:29,606
The opposite. Beth recommended
that he play more.

585
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:32,478
Start homeschooling
and take private lessons,

586
00:25:32,522 --> 00:25:34,306
leaving me behind.

587
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:37,701
So you were trying to bribe her
to change that recommendation.

588
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,137
It still sounds
like motive.

589
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,618
Well, I have an alibi.
Mm.

590
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:44,316
I was teaching ninth grade
chamber class

591
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,578
when Beth was murdered.

592
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:47,275
You-you can call the school.

593
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:52,498
If that's actually true,
then we're back to bupkes.

594
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:54,326
Unless Dan got a lead
from Beckett.

595
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:55,806
Beckett Wilson?

596
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:58,373
Well, it figures that
she'd be involved.

597
00:25:58,417 --> 00:25:59,636
She a student of yours?

598
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,681
Was. The kid's a nightmare.

599
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:04,031
I nearly ran her over
this morning on her scooter.

600
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:05,816
She was ditching first period.

601
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:09,907
Where are Beckett
and Dan, anyhow?

602
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,170
[tires screeching]What, Beckett?

603
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:15,042
Yup. I'm looking right at her.

Dan, where are you?

605
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:18,437
You were supposed to be
at the precinct hours ago.

606
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,352
I... uh, yeah.

00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:22,136
Sorry. Battery.[phone beeps]

I mean, it is your car.

610
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,012
Oh, I'll get it back,
unlike your dignity.

611

612

It's a big deal now.
All right?

616
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:40,590
I just talked to Chloe.

617
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,548
Beckett, she's a suspect.

618
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:44,202
So we got to call in
some backup.

619
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:46,683
Agreed. Agreed.

620
00:26:46,726 --> 00:26:50,295

best at hunting down humans.

Just say it.

698
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:52,711
I understand why you
chickened out.

699
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:54,887
It was too risky, okay?

700
00:30:54,931 --> 00:30:56,671
You do?

701
00:30:56,715 --> 00:30:59,500
Yeah. You're afraid that
people, even nice people,

702
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:03,548
wouldn't accept people
who talk to dead people.

703
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:05,463
But...
No but. Okay?

704
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:07,682
You don't know what it's like
to tell someone the truth

705
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:10,337
and have them look at you
with pity in their eyes

706
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:12,035
like you're crazy.

707
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:16,909
And if my friends here
ever looked at me like that,

708
00:31:16,953 --> 00:31:18,868
it would break my heart.

709
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,217
I think your
coworkers here

710
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,132
are real friends, like Chloe...

711
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:24,525
Chloe is the nicest person ever.

712
00:31:24,569 --> 00:31:26,092
Okay? But she's all about things

713
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:28,051
that she can see
and prove

714
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,401
and I don't think
that she'd get it.

715
00:31:30,444 --> 00:31:35,580
And the truth is, I don't want
to give her the chance not to.

716
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:40,585
Ray-Ray.

717
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:42,717
The neighbors have
a construction dumpster.

718
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:44,850
Holy smokes.

719
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:53,554
You know, I love
your perfume.

720
00:31:53,598 --> 00:31:54,642
What is that? Freesia?

721
00:31:54,686 --> 00:31:57,776
Yes. Thank you.That music,

722
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,038
it's beautiful.

723
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:00,431
You must be so
proud of Felix.

724
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:01,780
He's so talented.

725
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:04,304
Well, he never puts
that violin down.
Really?

726
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:06,872
My daughter, she goes through
interests like candy.

727
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:08,830
I can't get her to
commit to anything.

728
00:32:08,874 --> 00:32:11,094
Commitment has never
been Felix's problem.

729
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,791
He loves his violin.

730
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:14,967
Once, he walked out the door
without pants,

731
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:16,882
but he still
had his violin.

732
00:32:16,926 --> 00:32:18,275
[both laugh]

733
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:21,365
So, he would never
leave it behind,

734
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:22,932
like at a therapist's office?

735
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:25,108
Oh, God no.
He sleeps with the thing.

736
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,632
Hmm. And how
did you feel

737
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:30,069
when Beth recommended that
Felix do homeschooling

738
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:32,942
so he could play
violin full-time?

739
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:35,466
I'm sorry,
but that's not right.

740
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:38,251
Um, Beth recommended that
Felix stay in his school.

741
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:39,949
In fact,
she was encouraging him

742
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:43,039
to branch out
with new activities.

743
00:32:43,082 --> 00:32:46,607
At least,
that's what Anthony told me.

744
00:32:46,651 --> 00:32:49,045
And where is Anthony now?

745
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:55,355
What the heck
are you doing?

746
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:56,704
Where would you hide
a murder weapon?

747
00:32:56,748 --> 00:32:59,011
Not in your trash.
That is way too easy.

748
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:00,360
Your neighbor's trash, maybe.

749
00:33:00,404 --> 00:33:02,362
But a construction dumpster?
Perfect.

750
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:03,973
You're really good
at this stuff, you know.

751
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,236
Even though it is, um, gross.

752
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,716
Yeah. I mean,
this is my thang!

753
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,196
And you know what they say.

754
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,548
One man's trash is
a forensic scientist's treasure.

755
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:19,510
One murder weapon,

756
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:22,817
with dried blood
from the victim to boot.

757
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:24,080
[dumpster clangs]Duck!

758
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,955
I really wish
you hadn't found that.

759
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,964
CHLOE:
Freeze!

760
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:40,661
Lower the bat, Anthony.
It's over.

761
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:43,577
We know Felix didn't leave
his violin at Beth's.

762
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,839
He followed you there,

763
00:33:44,883 --> 00:33:48,060
and has been covering
for you ever since.

764
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:50,410
You don't understand.

765
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:54,545
I sent Felix to Beth
to help him,

766
00:33:54,588 --> 00:33:57,026
not make him worse.

767
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,114
He doesn't have any friends.

768
00:33:58,157 --> 00:34:00,029
He doesn't have a life.

769
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:02,248
"Play the violin more."

770
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:04,076
That's not normal.

771
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,383
ELLA: You're right,
that's not normal.

772
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:08,907
It's amazing.

773
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,648
And that's what
makes him special.

774
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,090
CHLOE: Put your hands
behind your back.

775
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:19,570
[drops bat]

776
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:26,751
Thanks.

777
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,797
[sighs]

778
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:32,148
I see ghosts.

779
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:36,717
Well, more like "ghost."

780
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:39,459
I see one ghost.

781
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:41,461
Okay, um...

782
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:44,247
I think I'm gonna need
a bit more.

783
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,337
Okay, so...

784
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,816
when I was eight years old,

785
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,471
I was in a really,
really bad car wreck.

786
00:34:51,515 --> 00:34:55,388
And-and that's when I
saw her for the first time.

787
00:34:55,432 --> 00:34:58,391
And at first, I thought
she was just a figment

788
00:34:58,435 --> 00:35:01,307
of my imagination,
from the trauma.

789
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,136
But she kept coming back.

790
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,443
And-and-and then I thought

791
00:35:06,486 --> 00:35:08,358
she was just an
imaginary friend.

792
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:11,839
But as I got older,
I realized

793
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:14,494
that she wasn't imaginary,
she was real,

794
00:35:14,538 --> 00:35:19,543
because she felt so...
so real to me.

795
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:23,373
And that's when she
told me she was a ghost.

796
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:27,507
So I have a friend
who's a ghost.

797
00:35:27,551 --> 00:35:30,162
Or at least-- at least
I hope that's what she is,

798
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:32,773
'cause if it really is
just all in my head,

799
00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:35,428
then I'm legit crazy.

800
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:39,040
Do you think I'm crazy?

801
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:41,608
No.

802
00:35:41,652 --> 00:35:44,307
It-It's...

803
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,224
definitely
a-a lot to process...

804
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:51,879
but no, Ella,
I don't think you're crazy.

805
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:54,882
Honestly, I have seen

806
00:35:54,926 --> 00:35:59,539
a lot crazier things.

807
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,368
Like, a lot.

808
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:05,458
And besides,
there is nothing that...

809
00:36:05,502 --> 00:36:07,199
that you could tell me
that would change

810
00:36:07,243 --> 00:36:08,592
they way I feel about you.

811
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,031
Come here.

812
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:15,251
[sniffles]

813
00:36:15,294 --> 00:36:16,948
You okay?

814
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:19,559
I've never been better.

815
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:25,522
Oh, and any news
on the move to Detroit?

816
00:36:25,565 --> 00:36:27,741
[scoffs]
Detroit schmetroit.

817
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,352
I ain't moving back there.Oh...

818
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,658
Hell no.
[laughs]

819
00:36:31,702 --> 00:36:32,790
Yeah, girl!

820
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:37,229
Makes me so happy.
Thanks.

821
00:36:37,273 --> 00:36:39,710
Good job tonight.
Thanks.

822
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:45,281
RAY-RAY:
Told ya.

823
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:50,024
See? I told you
your friends are great.

824
00:36:50,068 --> 00:36:52,157
[sighs]
The best.

825
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:56,117
So... a deal's a deal.

826
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:59,120
I said I would leave after,
uh, this case was closed,

827
00:36:59,164 --> 00:37:02,036
so I guess this is adios.

828
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,518
Uh, wait...
question.

829
00:37:05,562 --> 00:37:08,042
If you say you're here
to look out for me,

830
00:37:08,086 --> 00:37:11,263
is that what you've been doing
since the car wreck?

831
00:37:11,307 --> 00:37:14,484
Sort of like a...
I don't know,

832
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:16,790
ghost guardian angel?

833
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,924
You could say I'm just a
friend who's got your back.

834
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:24,233
Well, I suppose you can
check on my back,

835
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,626
you know, once in a while.

836
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,281
But, seriously, don't
spy on me in the shower.

837
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:31,283
Deal.

838
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:34,634
Well, smell you later, Lopez.

839
00:37:39,117 --> 00:37:41,554
ELLA:
Uh, what is that?

840
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:43,643
Well, I think
it speaks for itself,

841
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:46,211
but unfortunately,
I'm sworn to secrecy.

842
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:47,212
[chuckles]

843
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:49,083
Hmm.

844
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:51,956
Well, you do you.

845
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,219
Oh, I always do.

846
00:37:54,263 --> 00:37:55,960
Smell you later,
Lucifer.

847
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:58,702
Uh, Ms. Lopez?

848
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:00,181
Hmm?

849
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:02,967
Since when do you use
that particular turn of phrase,

850
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,316
"Smell you later"?

851
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,796
I've never heard you
say that before.

852
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,279
Oh, it's just something
my friend Ray-Ray says.

853
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:18,417
[elevator bell dings]

854
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:28,427
I know you're here.

855
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:35,304
Come on,
time to show yourself.

856
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,480
[whooshing]

857
00:38:38,437 --> 00:38:39,917
[chuckles softly]

858
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,789
Well, hello, Azrael.

859
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:45,357
What, too cool to
call me Ray-Ray anymore?

860
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:47,577
Well, endearing nicknames
are reserved for siblings

861
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,275
who didn't abandon me
for millennia, so...

862
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:52,321
[sighs]

863
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:55,149
I didn't abandon you.
I've been busy.

864
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:56,499
Oh.

865
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,414
I mean, you try being
the Angel of Death.

866
00:38:58,457 --> 00:39:01,199
A lot of people die, Lu.You're telling me.

867
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:02,635
Okay, I get it, you're pissed.

868
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,984
I should have
reached out to you

869
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,551
when Dad kicked your butt
down to Hell.

870
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:07,945
And I was going to,
but, you know,

871
00:39:07,988 --> 00:39:10,469
a day turned into a week,
which turned to, you know,

872
00:39:10,513 --> 00:39:11,601
a thousand years,

873
00:39:11,644 --> 00:39:13,951
and then it just seemed weird.

874
00:39:13,994 --> 00:39:16,954
Well, congratulations.
Weirdness averted.

875
00:39:16,997 --> 00:39:19,217
Uh, you weren't there, Lu.
You don't know.

876
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,566
When Dad kicked you out,

877
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,613
the whole family was rocked,
me especially.

878
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:26,616
Oh, really?
Why is that?
Because,

879
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:30,010
I lost my favorite
big brother, you dope.

880
00:39:30,054 --> 00:39:32,404
[scoffs]

881
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:33,840
Come on, Lu.

882
00:39:33,884 --> 00:39:35,799
Remember when we
used to prank Amenadiel?

883
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:39,193
Please tell me he still has
that hilarious angry face.

884
00:39:39,237 --> 00:39:41,457
[chuckles]

885
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,633
Still angry.
Still hilarious.

886
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:47,332
Mostly, I just missed you
listening to me

887
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:49,813
drone on about whatever
was on my mind.

888
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:53,164
I know it may have not
meant much to you,

889
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:55,558
but it mattered
a lot to me.

890
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,910
Look, I-I'm sorry.
I-I made a mistake.

891
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:04,044
But you started
a freaking rebellion, Lucifer.

892
00:40:04,088 --> 00:40:05,176
Nobody's perfect.

893
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:06,960
[scoffs]

894
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:10,660
I suppose you're
right about that.

895
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:12,923
But why are you here now,

896
00:40:12,966 --> 00:40:15,012
and how does Ms. Lopez
know of you?

897
00:40:15,055 --> 00:40:16,230
Oh, that.

898
00:40:16,274 --> 00:40:17,667
Oh, don't worry,
I'm not Dad.

899
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,234
I have no qualms with you
interacting with humans.

900
00:40:20,278 --> 00:40:22,236
[sighs]
Well, come on.

901
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:26,502
Ella was in a gnarly car wreck

902
00:40:26,545 --> 00:40:28,504
when she was young,
and I showed up to,

903
00:40:28,547 --> 00:40:30,375
you know, do my
Angel of Death thing.

904
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:32,899
But what, false alarm?

905
00:40:32,943 --> 00:40:34,292
It happens.

906
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:38,688
This time, I don't know,
I-I didn't want to leave.

907
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:39,863
I mean, you know Ella.

908
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:41,299
There's just
something about her.

909
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:44,215
She's so positive.
She makes you feel like...

910
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:46,478
Good about yourself.

911
00:40:46,522 --> 00:40:47,827
Yeah! Exactly!

912
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:50,221
I only ever get to
talk to deadhumans.

913
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:52,049
I mean, they're so morose.

914
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:54,791
Anyway, whenever I was
in the neighborhood,

915
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:57,489
I'd stop by, see
how she was doing,

916
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:58,795
and we became friends.

917
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:01,711
But apparently,
it's weird

918
00:41:01,754 --> 00:41:04,017
if people talk to
invisible angels.

919
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,934
So I told her I was a ghost,
which didn't help.

920
00:41:07,978 --> 00:41:12,025
So I sent her to be
out here with you.

921
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,464
You did what?

922
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:17,727
First, Dad puts
the detective here,

923
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,556
and now you're trying
to manipulate me with Ms. Lopez.

924
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:23,559
Why does everyone think
I need help meeting women?

925
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:27,388
Relax.
I-I didn't do it for you,

926
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:28,825
I did it for her.

927
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:32,698
Well, both of you, I guess.

928
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:35,353
See, since I couldn't really
be with her,

929
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:37,181
and I couldn't be with you,

930
00:41:37,224 --> 00:41:41,272
I thought at least
two of my favorite people

931
00:41:41,315 --> 00:41:42,403
could be together.

932
00:41:42,447 --> 00:41:43,927
[chuckles softly]

933
00:41:46,277 --> 00:41:48,148
And that's the only reason
that you're here?

934
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:50,847
Pretty much.

935
00:41:53,632 --> 00:41:54,851

936
00:41:54,894 --> 00:41:56,983

Yes. I was just wondering
how it's going

947
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:28,667
with my good friend,
Ms. Lopez,

948
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:31,757
as I just heard you'll be
staying with us a while longer.

950
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:35,805
Excellent choice,
by the way.

951
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:40,113
Yeah, I mean,
I was just, you know,

952
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,551
comparing DNA on a block
of regular wood

953
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:43,813
versus synthetic wood.

954
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,684
Oh.
So, the cells
in the synthetic--

955
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:47,686
Sorry, you were probably
just being polite.

956
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,948
No, no, no, no.
Not at all.

Please, tell me more.
I'm all ears.

Oh, well, it's fascinating.

959
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,609
See, the plastic
preserves the DNA.

960
00:42:57,653 --> 00:42:59,219
Right? But with
the regular wood,

961
00:42:59,263 --> 00:43:01,308
the cells get soaked up,
kind of like, um,

962
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:03,659
