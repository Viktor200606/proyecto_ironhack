1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,372
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:03,434
I'm really glad that
you told me how you felt.

3
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:06,820
The one man I've cared
about, I still gave him up.

4
00:00:06,823 --> 00:00:08,828
That's how much I care
about our friendship.

5
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:11,325
Go to hell.

6
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:13,015
Chloe Decker, will you marry me?

7
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:14,278
Lucifer's the reason

8
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,796
that I said yes to Pierce.

9
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:17,590
He's also the reason that I said no.

10
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:19,390
Okay, you could kill me, sure.

11
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:20,687
But Linda would die, too.

12
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:23,604
I was afraid

13
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,289
that if you saw all of
me, you would run away.

14
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,179
Chloe, I am the Devil.

15
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:29,814
No, you're not.

16
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:31,015
Not to me.

17
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:33,242
I have been coming here
ever since I realized that

18
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:34,445
this may be the closest

19
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:35,781
to Heaven that I'll ever get.

20
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:43,353
Let's go home.

21
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,542
I'll never get to see her again.

22
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:05,245
I know.

23
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:07,747
I still can't believe it.

24
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:11,384
Well, at least you'll
get to see her, Detective.

25
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:14,853
Eventually. In Heaven.

26
00:01:16,257 --> 00:01:19,091
But I... well, sadly,
she's gone somewhere

27
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:21,460
I simply can't follow.

28
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:25,331
You know I'm here for you, right?

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,201
And I you, Detective.

30
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,340
How's poor Daniel?

31
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:38,209
Hmm, about as good as you could expect.

32
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,944
He's throwing himself into work,

33
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,309
but so far we've come up empty.

34
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:43,598
No witnesses.

35
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,816
No security cameras up here.

36
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:48,653
Hey, Ella.

37
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:49,854
You have anything?

38
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:52,056
Uh, no, nothing yet.

39
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:53,924
I'm trying, I-I really am,

40
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:56,270
but there's, uh, no DNA,

41
00:01:56,273 --> 00:01:57,793
no fingerprints.

42
00:01:57,796 --> 00:01:59,973
Uh, bullets are nine millimeter.

43
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:03,034
Pretty common, so that's not helpful.

44
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:04,635
Who would do something like this?

45
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:06,418
Okay, everyone, I know this is hard.

46
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,825
But time is of the
essence. Lopez, I want you

47
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,525
to expand the search area.

48
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:13,210
Decker, build a suspect list.

49
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:14,611
Espinoza...

50
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:15,923
go home.

51
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,947
- I need to be here, Lieutenant.
- Dan...

52
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:19,181
you need to grieve.

53
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:20,817
I will grieve...

54
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,415
when it's done.

55
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:24,554
We're gonna find who did this.

56
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,456
I'm on it, Lieutenant.

57
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,326
Uh, Lucifer, hold back a second.

58
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:32,762
Have you spoken to Amenadiel?

59
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:34,033
- Why?
- Well, I know

60
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:36,900
he and Charlotte were close.
He might know something.

61
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:39,334
I can talk to him myself if
you have an idea where he is.

62
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:41,536
Well, I think I know
exactly where he is.

63
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:42,671
You do?

64
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:44,676
Yes.

65
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,242
I'm-I'm not following.

66
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,868
Well, it appears

67
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,697
that my brother got his wings back.

68
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,782
How is that possible?

69
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:57,931
Amenadiel had a crazy theory...

70
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,154
Or so I thought...

71
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:00,589
That everything that's happened to us,

72
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:02,653
him losing his wings, me gaining mine,

73
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:04,184
even my lost Devil face...

74
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:06,103
- And you believe that?
- Well, I didn't.

75
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:09,290
But I'm fairly certain
he's up in Heaven now

76
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:11,065
and took dear Charlotte with him,

77
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,634
so perhaps there's something to it.

78
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:15,248
You think Amenadiel's gone forever?

79
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,771
Well, who knows if he'll ever return,

80
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:19,037
now he's finally home
in the Silver City.

81
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,263
Okay. No Amenadiel. Great.

82
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,243
Excuse me?

83
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,444
It's one less thing to juggle

84
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:25,099
as we try to track down this killer.

85
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:28,081
Right.

86
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,594
Oh, wow.

87
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:53,474
The Sinnerman himself returns.

88
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:56,067
You know, the boys will be thrilled.

89
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:58,169
Everyone's ready to
get back to business.

90
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,537
I'm not back.

91
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:02,098
I just need something taken care of.

92
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,334
Any luck so far?

93
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,703
Well, I went through the list.

94
00:05:04,706 --> 00:05:07,073
I found the perfect favor to cash in.

95
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:09,647
Should do just the trick.

96
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:13,917
Good work.

97
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,253
You okay, boss?

98
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:19,256
I've never seen you scared.

99
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:21,859
You're right, you haven't.

100
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:24,646
Because I've never been
scared of dying before.

101
00:05:25,836 --> 00:05:27,998
Of losing everything.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,630
But that doesn't make me weak,
it makes me more dangerous.

103
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:32,134
Yeah. Sure.

104
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,972
Okay, boss.

105
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:38,052
Uh...

106
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:40,489
What do you want us to do with
the woman back at your place?

107
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:41,591
I may still need her.

108
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:42,833
Keep her alive.

109
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:43,932
For now.

110
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:45,396
Don't worry.

111
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,961
My best men are on her.

112
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:56,292
Linda.

113
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:58,494
Wouldn't worry about
your friend, sweetie.

114
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:01,963
You got bigger problems.

115
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,806
She doesn't seem that scary.

116
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,915
My nose!

117
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,640
She broke my damn nose!

118
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,144
I hope Maze is okay.

119
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,202
- Why is that?
- Well, I had to book another sitter,

120
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,571
'cause I couldn't get a hold of her.

121
00:06:56,573 --> 00:06:57,606
She's Maze.

122
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:58,708
I'm sure she's fine.

123
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,341
- Yeah.
- This is astounding.

124
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,985
Who knew Charlotte was
prosecuting so many cases?

125
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,347
I know, and she wasn't afraid

126
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,791
to go after the most
dangerous criminals.

127
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,394
That's our Charlotte.

128
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,662
Yeah.

129
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:11,997
Guys.

130
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,501
There's something you need to know.

131
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:15,290
Now, it's gonna sound completely crazy,

132
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:17,243
but I need you to hear me out, okay?

133
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:18,538
Of course.

134
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,648
What is it?

135
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,287
Try not to react.

136
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,076
If anyone realizes what we know,

137
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:25,210
our lives are in danger.

138
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,845
Okay. Okay. What's up, Dan?

139
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,766
I figured out who killed Charlotte.

140
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,829
- What?
- It was Pierce.

141
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,344
What are you talking about, Daniel?

142
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:34,438
Why would he do that?

143
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:37,547
Charlotte was investigating him.

144
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,023
She was? Why?

145
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,793
Well, that's the craziest part.

146
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,662
Pierce...

147
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:45,876
Pierce is The Sinnerman.

148
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,100
Dan, listen, uh...

149
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,770
I can't imagine what you're
going through right now.

150
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,939
- But this does sound a little...
- Insane?

151
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,540
Completely nuts? No, I get it.

152
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,937
I know what it sounds like,
Chloe, but do you believe me...

153
00:07:57,939 --> 00:07:59,038
Daniel's right.

154
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,277
- Excuse me?
- Pierce is indeed The Sinnerman.

155
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,747
I mean, I don't know
if he killed Charlotte,

156
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,600
but he certainly seemed mightily
relieved Amenadiel was gone.

157
00:08:05,603 --> 00:08:06,444
Wait, you knew?

158
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:07,659
Yes. He told me months ago.

159
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:08,619
- What?
- You knew?

160
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,780
You freakin' knew?

161
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:11,088
- Daniel, Daniel!
- You...

162
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,823
Daniel, like you said.

163
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,132
Please, be careful,

164
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:15,500
people are watching.

165
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:16,869
Okay?

166
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,272
Good? Yes?

167
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,906
This cannot be true. Can it?

168
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:26,002
I mean... if you knew this,
why wouldn't you say something?

169
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,670
I mean, I almost married him.

170
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:29,503
I mean, I almost married him.

171
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:31,436
I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

172
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,408
No, you said he's immortal,

173
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:34,918
and that is something
completely different.

174
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,046
Is it? If I'd told you he
was The Sinnerman as well,

175
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:40,018
- would you have believed me?
- I don't know, maybe!

176
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:42,546
Maybe, because that's
something that actually exists,

177
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,316
and not some metaphor
that you've made up.

178
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:45,735
I haven't made up anything, Detective,

179
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:47,862
I always tell you the
truth, no matter what.

180
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:49,065
Okay, ignoring

181
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:52,361
all the craziness, do
you believe me, Chloe?

182
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,864
I-I...

183
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,766
I don't see anything
in here that proves it.

184
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:58,668
Pierce wants to talk to everyone.

185
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,339
Charlotte Richards was one of us.

186
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:03,372
She fought tooth and nail

187
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:05,574
to make sure that our arrests stuck.

188
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:10,198
To make sure that the bad
guys stayed off the streets.

189
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:12,206
And now...

190
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:17,519
Pierce doesn't get emotional.

191
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:20,687
Now she's gone.

192
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,807
I don't like this. He's lying.

193
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,242
But we will find whoever did this.

194
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:28,029
We need to get justice for Charlotte.

195
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:30,666
If it's the last thing that we do.

196
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,066
He did it, didn't he?

197
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:33,565
He killed Charlotte.

198
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:35,437
It appears so, Detective.

199
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:38,873
And now he's overseeing the
whole damn investigation.

200
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,628
How do we take him down?

201
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,587

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

202
00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:57,091
How do we approach this?

203
00:09:57,094 --> 00:10:00,302
You buy me five minutes in
interrogation with that dick,

204
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:02,689
- and I swear to you, I will break him.
- Dan.

205
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:04,390
You're gonna need to
get a hold of your anger.

206
00:10:04,392 --> 00:10:05,858
I know it's not easy.

207
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,127
It's the only way that
we can bring him down.

208
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,462
Can you do that?

209
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:11,997
Yeah.

210
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,265
I can.

211
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:15,100
- I have no choice.
- Yeah, she's right.

212
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:17,385
Pierce is more formidable
than either of you realize.

213
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:19,702
We are talking about the
world's first killer, after all.

214
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:22,002
And you. No more of your metaphors.

215
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:24,151
- They're not metaphors.
- We need to focus on Pierce.

216
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:26,035
But when this is all done,
you and I are gonna talk

217
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:28,143
about everything that
you've been keeping from me.

218
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:29,638
Very well.

219
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,208
Great.

220
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,277
What's our first move?

221
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,893
Well, Pierce still needs
to cover his tracks,

222
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:38,396
so if I were him, I'd be
looking for a fall guy.

223
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,776
This was just found at the crime scene.

224
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,144
I totally missed the little bugger

225
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:43,580
in the first couple of canvasses.

226
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,349
I mean, thank God Pierce held off

227
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,505
on releasing the scene
until we did a third sweep.

228
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:48,641
We may have never found it.

229
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:50,068
Oh, I guarantee you wouldn't have.

230
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,402
Did you find any DNA on it?

231
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:53,076
Yeah and we got a match.

232
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:55,654
A guy named Steve Chamberlain.

233
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:57,641
That's one of the men that
Charlotte was gonna prosecute.

234
00:10:57,643 --> 00:11:00,198
A hedge fund manager
that was using a charity

235
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,216
to embezzle money.

236
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:02,880
Sounds exactly like the kind of dirtbag

237
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:04,785
- who would do something this terrible.
- Hey, Ella,

238
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:08,052
there's something that I need you to...

239
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:09,871
There's something that you should do.

240
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:11,233
Okay, so if they found this,

241
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,503
at the scene, there's
probably more evidence,

242
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,091
so have the team do another sweep.

243
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:16,559
- You got it.
- We have a lead?

244
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:17,995
Yeah.

245
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:21,612
Uh, DNA at the scene points
to one of the criminals

246
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,268
that Charlotte was gonna prosecute.

247
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:24,818
That's great.

248
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:26,154
Well, keep me posted.

249
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:27,970
Let me know if there's
anything you need.

250
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:29,350
Yeah, will do.

251
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:31,987
Espinoza.

252
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,443
Uh, yeah, Lieutenant?

253
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:35,260
Thought I told you to go home.

254
00:11:35,263 --> 00:11:37,662
Yes, sir, you did.

255
00:11:39,718 --> 00:11:42,044
Well, if I were you, I
would still be here, too.

256
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:43,579
If there's anything you need...

257
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:47,756
I need... to catch the
bastard that killed Charlotte.

258
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,759
Good luck.

259
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:54,227
The improv's paying off.

260
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,385
Admirable work, Daniel.

261
00:11:56,388 --> 00:11:57,666
For whatever good it does.

262
00:11:57,669 --> 00:11:59,035
If we don't arrest Pierce's fall guy,

263
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:00,702
he's gonna know we're onto him.

264
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:04,913
But if we do, then we
lose the time that we need

265
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,317
to prove that Pierce is
really the one who did it.

266
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,552
Maybe not.

267
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,377
Think Pierce has gone back
to his Sinnerman network?

268
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,262
It makes sense. Pierce
needs to move quickly,

269
00:12:27,264 --> 00:12:28,830
and there are thousands
of people in Los Angeles

270
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,832
that owe him a favor.

271
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:31,885
Well, maybe one of them
is in Chamberlain's orbit.

272
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:33,634
If we can figure out who
owes Pierce the favor,

273
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,205
maybe we can get him to flip on him.

274
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,596
It's a long shot, but...

275
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,940
Yeah, but it's the best
one we got so far, so...

276
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,541
Yeah.

277
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:55,526
I told you not to park under that tree.

278
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,391
You need to clean this crap.

279
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,059
LAPD.

280
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,662
Want to ask you some questions
about Charlotte Richards.

281
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:03,073
Yeah, sure.

282
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:04,870
Can we take this inside?

283
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:06,372
Nosy neighbors and all that.

284
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,354
Not sure why you came all this way.

285
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,795
I'm not answering any
questions without my lawyer.

286
00:13:13,798 --> 00:13:16,331
We're not here about
the embezzling case.

287
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:19,002
Charlotte Richards was murdered.

288
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,787
What?

289
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,659
Yeah. And your DNA was found
at the scene of the crime.

290
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:26,448
I didn't murder her.

291
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,151
- We know.
- You got to listen to me.

292
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:30,284
I... You do?

293
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:31,991
You see, we think you're being framed.

294
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,297
And we'd like your help in trying

295
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:34,660
to find out who framed you.

296
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:36,593
Is this some weird reverse psychology?

297
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:37,728
What's your angle?

298
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:40,198
Never mind. I'm calling my lawyer.

299
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:41,909
If you do that, we can't help you.

300
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:44,837
Sorry, but this good cop,
bad cop, sad cop thing

301
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,091
isn't working on me.

302
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:48,596
Besides, a cigarette butt
is pretty flimsy evidence.

303
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:51,408
He's right. A good frame
job would need more.

304
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:52,588
Like the murder weapon.

305
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:54,078
- Where would you hide it?
- Nowhere,

306
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,446
because I didn't murder her.

307
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:57,822
If you did, where
would you hide the gun?

308
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,408
- In my desk.
- What, that one?

309
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,419
I don't... yes. That one.

310
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:04,456
You know, it's not gonna be
there, because I'm not a...

311
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:09,700
murderer. W-Whoa. That is not mine.

312
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:11,721
For the last time, we know.

313
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:13,265
Someone planted this gun here.

314
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:14,854
We need to know who had access

315
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:16,552
to this area in the last 12 hours.

316
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,854
- Oh, no.
- What?

317
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,861
Had a few friends over today, have you?

318
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:22,127
Oh, just a hundred or so.

319
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:30,432
I think we made a real
breakthrough today, Simon.

320
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:31,494
Thanks.

321
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:33,565
A-And I know you're right, Linda.

322
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,786
Not everyone's out to get me.

323
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,921
Yeah. Okay. Good.

324
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:44,151
- Are you here to kill her?
- No, no!

325
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:46,935
That's exactly what someone
trying to kill her would say.

326
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:47,974
No. No, I...

327
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:49,599
Maze, he's a patient.

328
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,951
See you next week?

329
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:58,841
What the hell happened?!

330
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:00,677
Are you okay?

331
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,697
Yes! I'm fine.

332
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,214
Good.

333
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,150
All right, we need to figure out

334
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:10,799
who would get a favor
from The Sinnerman.

335
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,746
Well, you did bring along
your own master of favors.

336
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:14,539
I could suss out who
needed one the most.

337
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,714
Dude, we don't have time
to go person to person.

338
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:19,167
Pierce is gonna start
wondering where we are soon.

339
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,294
Yeah, you're right.

340
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:22,003
We need to narrow down the list fast.

341
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,715
You know everybody here.

342
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:25,644
I mean, who would have a dark secret

343
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:26,819
that they would want erased?

344
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:28,581
Uh, everyone.

345
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:30,022
What? It's a charity event.

346
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:31,857
Ah, charity is the perfect way

347
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:33,294
for criminals to launder their images.

348
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:34,588
Donate a thousand dollars to distract

349
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,790
from the million you just filched.

350
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,161
He's not wrong.

351
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:39,922
That guy. Sweatshop abuse.

352
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:42,519
Him? Insider trading.

353
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:45,828
Her? Stole the idea for a
company from her own sister.

354
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:47,144
So it could be anyone.

355
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,292
Everyone here is guilty.

356
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,766
Which means The Sinnerman's
not very good at what he does.

357
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:53,511
Should've left it to the
professionals, namely moi.

358
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:55,678
- Y-You're right.
- Well, thank you.

359
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:57,381
No, I mean he is good at what he does.

360
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:58,849
If somebody made a
deal with The Sinnerman,

361
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:00,317
he's gonna make their skeletons vanish.

362
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:02,095
And no one would know
about their crimes at all.

363
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:04,221
Which means we're not
looking for a criminal.

364
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:07,691
We're looking for somebody
as clean as can be.

365
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:10,831
Dan.

366
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:13,662
Dan.

367
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:16,537
Who hired you to frame your boss?

368
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,968
What? What are you talking about?

369
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,225
- Dan.
- You are innocent.

370
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,727
And that's a bad thing?

371
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,170
You're the only one who has
access to Chamberlain's office

372
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:24,740
and the only one with no dirty laundry.

373
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:26,876
Now, the woman I loved is dead,
so if you don't start talking...

374
00:16:26,878 --> 00:16:28,185
Daniel, Daniel! Daniel, Daniel.

375
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,845
I understand your anger,

376
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:30,980
but perhaps a lighter touch

377
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:32,390
might help reveal the truth faster.

378
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:35,016
I mean, after all, this
young man did ask for a favor

379
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:36,047
from The Sinnerman,

380
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,488
so you must've wanted something
very badly, didn't you?

381
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:41,423
Yeah. Tell me.

382
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,091
What is it you desired?

383
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:47,023
I wished I never sneezed.

384
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:49,560
You interrupted me for
a stupid parlor trick?

385
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:51,165
Dan, it's not a trick.

386
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:53,598
I-I don't know what
it is, but it works.

387
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:55,637
Calm down.

388
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,038
What happened when you sneezed?

389
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,041
I...

390
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:02,744
I took my eyes off
the road for a second.

391
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:05,633
And... this...

392
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:07,201
this motorcycle pulled in front of me

393
00:17:07,204 --> 00:17:08,482
at just the wrong time.

394
00:17:08,484 --> 00:17:09,907
So you killed a biker

395
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,153
and then found somebody who
could make it all disappear.

396
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:16,141
I heard about a guy who gave out favors,

397
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:17,524
so I called him.

398
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:19,093
And the next morning I...

399
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:20,929
it was like it never happened.

400
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,230
But it did happen.

401
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,832
No matter how much time has passed,

402
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,422
every time I look in the
mirror, all I see is...

403
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:27,557
A monster.

404
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,790
And then this morning

405
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:31,126
he called in his favor.

406
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,451
How'd he contact you?
Would you recognize him?

407
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,542
I never saw anybody.

408
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:36,873
A burner phone showed up

409
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:38,333
at my doorstep this morning

410
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:41,052
and everything after was
handled through dead drops.

411
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:42,654
All right. We're gonna need that phone.

412
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:44,351
Okay.

413
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:47,321
We're running out of time.

414
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:49,732
Okay, so then we buy more.
We bring Chamberlain in.

415
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,990
We let him lawyer up so he doesn't talk.

416
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:53,985
And then what? Pierce
works with the pros.

417
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:55,991
There's a good chance there's
no evidence on the burner phone.

418
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,359
Well, perhaps it's time
we asked for some help.

419
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:09,873
Hey. I got your text. What's up?

420
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:14,146
I need something from you.

421
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:16,582
Of course you do.

422
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:17,916
I do, too, actually.

423
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,650
That's not what I meant. I...

424
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:21,932
Hey. Hey.

425
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,068
You have been through so much.

426
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:26,125
Okay?

427
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:28,658
You need to go home.

428
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:30,618
You need to take care of you.

429
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:33,068
We got the guy.

430
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,367
That's just it. I need you...

431
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:37,835
What's up?

432
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,088
I need you to do me a favor.

433
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:48,279
Something you can't tell anyone about.

434
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,623
Lopez, you want to come in or what?

435
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,191
Uh...

436
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:02,727
Hey, boss.

437
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:04,495
What is it?

438
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:07,965
Dan gave something to me.

439
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,079
Asked me to examine it,

440
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,946
but told me not to tell anyone.

441
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:14,504
What is it?

442
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:17,173
A phone?

443
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:18,642
That's it?

444
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,969
Yeah. I mean, he... honestly, he sounded

445
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:22,071
kind of crazy.

446
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:23,211
He was going on and on

447
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:26,774
about some frame job or something.

448
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:28,946
Huh. Well, what all did he say?

449
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:30,391
Uh, not much more than that.

450
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:33,524
He-he claimed that "people
might be listening."

451
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:35,032
I know, it sounds insane.

452
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:36,930
I-I know he's not in a great place.

453
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:40,200
I told him he should just
go home and get some sleep.

454
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:42,551
I'm-I'm really worried about him.

455
00:19:42,554 --> 00:19:44,750
It's okay. I'm glad you
came to me with this, Ella.

456
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:48,271
But I don't want Dan
to get into any trouble.

457
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:51,008
He's not in any trouble. I promise.

458
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,883
Okay.

459
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:02,056
Yeah, it's me.

460
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,159
One of my officers is on to you.

461
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,688
I don't need excuses.

462
00:20:05,691 --> 00:20:07,425
I just need you to take care of it.

463
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:45,761
Hello, Pierce.

464
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:47,618
It's time for a reckoning.

465
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,954
What are you talking about?

466
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,711
I know you killed Charlotte.

467
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:56,886
So, why'd you do it, Piercy?

468
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,860
Why kill Charlotte?

469
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:00,859
I don't know what
this is about, Lucifer.

470
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:03,092
We caught the murderer. I
don't know why you think...

471
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,701
The detective isn't here, which means

472
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:09,437
I'm invulnerable and you're not, so...

473
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,476
sit...

474
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:15,612
down.

475
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:18,148
Or I'll make you.

476
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:27,691
Lucifer...

477
00:21:27,693 --> 00:21:30,841
For every lie, I will break a body part.

478
00:21:30,844 --> 00:21:32,696
I didn't mean to kill Charlotte.

479
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:33,830
It was an accident.

480
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:35,529
I was trying to kill Amenadiel.

481
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:37,030
And that's supposed to
spare your life, is it?

482
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:39,008
You wanted by brother dead instead?

483
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:40,210
It's the truth.

484
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:41,580
But why?

485
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:44,974
God took my mark away.

486
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:47,410
I thought killing his favorite
son might bring it back.

487
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:52,615
Did you, now?

488
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:57,953
You know, when I first landed in Hell...

489
00:21:59,957 --> 00:22:03,726
I'd just led a rebellion
against dear old Dad.

490
00:22:05,227 --> 00:22:06,462
I failed.

491
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:09,232
Everyone hated me for it.

492
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:13,468
Myself included, I've come to realize.

493
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,170
I felt like a monster.

494
00:22:16,173 --> 00:22:19,234
And then, when I
looked at my reflection,

495
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,115
there was my Devil face.

496
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:22,844
Your Father's punishment.

497
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:25,280
So I thought, but...

498
00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:29,951
after speaking with a sneezy,
murderous driver today,

499
00:22:29,953 --> 00:22:33,121
I realized I felt like a monster

500
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:35,079
before I became one.

501
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:41,193
I think I gave myself that face.

502
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:48,543
You actually believe Amenadiel's theory?

503
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:51,500
And what about your wings?

504
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,007
Well, I'd just saved Mum, hadn't I?

505
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,710
And I'd decided to tell
the detective the truth.

506
00:22:56,712 --> 00:23:00,860
I felt better about
myself than I had in...

507
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:03,779
well... ever.

508
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:09,490
Maybe so much so that, deep down,

509
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:12,126
I felt like I wasn't a monster anymore.

510
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,005
What does any of this
have to do with me?

511
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:18,083
My curse was lifted when
Chloe fell in love with me.

512
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:22,035
Yeah. You see...

513
00:23:22,037 --> 00:23:24,004
I don't think that's what happened.

514
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:29,042
You were willing to sacrifice

515
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:31,318
the one thing you wanted
to protect someone else.

516
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:35,794
For the first time in
your miserable life, Cain,

517
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:39,787
you were selfless.

518
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:42,556
And maybe, deep down,

519
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,333
you felt that you finally deserved

520
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:49,211
the mortality that you
so desperately desired.

521
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:52,901
You fell in love with
the detective, Pierce,

522
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:54,422
not the other way around.

523
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:57,136
She never loved you.

524
00:23:57,138 --> 00:23:59,038
Oh, go ahead, hit me.

525
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,297
Yeah, be good to see
you break your hand.

526
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,243
You think you're not vulnerable
because Chloe's not here.

527
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:07,580
But guess what, you're
still very vulnerable.

528
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:10,550
Oh, please, do go on. I
like this desperate you.

529
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:11,938
You do have a weakness.

530
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:13,185
Mm.

531
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:15,573
You want to be good.

532
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:17,075
What?

533
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:21,523
- Help! Help, I'm being attacked!
- What on earth are you doing?

534
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,061
- Let go of me.
- Lucifer's trying to kill me!

535
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:25,013
No, no. What? No. No, no, no, no.

536
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:26,669
Let go of me. Let go of me!

537
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:28,891
Leave me alone! I
don't want to hurt you!

538
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:30,469
It's not me that you want!

539
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:32,915
Get off! Oh...

540
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:34,484
Get off of me!

541
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,512
So you just let him go.

542
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:41,098
You were supposed to
keep Pierce distracted,

543
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:43,575
not confront him in the
middle of the precinct.

544
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:46,348
I... overestimated my abilities

545
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,692
and underestimated his.

546
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,653
It's not his fault. I mean,

547
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,855
I wish I'd had a chance to
give Pierce a piece of my mind.

548
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,101
Thank you, Ms. Lopez.

549
00:24:53,104 --> 00:24:55,453
When Dan asked me to
give Pierce that phone,

550
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:57,493
and told me the whole crazy theory,

551
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,921
I got to be honest, I had a
really hard time believing it.

552
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:02,450
Yeah, well, the fact that
you do, Ella, it means a lot.

553
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:04,648
Hey, we're O.G.

554
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:06,364
Okay, you ask me to
take a leap of faith,

555
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:08,300
I'm already jumping.

556
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,605
But, you guys, when I
handed him that phone,

557
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:12,775
that look in his eyes...

558
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,044
I just wanted to tear his
damn throat out right there.

559
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,980
Okay, so now what?

560
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:19,916
We have no idea where Pierce is going,

561
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,046
who's still loyal to him.

562
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,785
Hell, we can't even
go back to the precinct

563
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,114
to run this guy's fingerprints

564
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:25,601
to figure out who the hell he is.

565
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:27,809
Pierce has completely
reinvented himself before.

566
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:28,958
He'll do it again.

567
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,226
Disappear forever.

568
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,894
Which means our window is tight.

569
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,046
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling him.

570
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:39,067
- Chloe.
- Hey.

571
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:41,375
I-I just heard that
Lucifer attacked you?

572
00:25:41,378 --> 00:25:43,038
Wha-What's going on?

573
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,340
What did Lucifer tell you?

574
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,807
That you're an immortal.

575
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:48,110
That, uh, you're Cain from the Bible.

576
00:25:48,112 --> 00:25:51,176
Just a bunch of, uh, uh, crazy stuff.

577
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,282
It's all true.

578
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:56,918
Hey... Marcus...

579
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,320
are you okay?

580
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,389
I'm fine.

581
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,854
It's good to hear your voice.

582
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:02,990
Yeah, you, too.

583
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:04,859
Where are you? I'm worried about you.

584
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:08,529
Lucifer's next to you, isn't he?

585
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:09,664
Espinoza, too?

586
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,532
What? No.

587
00:26:11,534 --> 00:26:13,868
You're a good liar,
but I know you, Chloe.

588
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,441
Yeah.

589
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:23,028
Yeah, they're here.

590
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:24,278
Ella, too,

591
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,145
and the guy you sent to kill Dan.

592
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:28,301
Chloe, I can explain.

593
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:30,833
You know what, I don't
believe a word you say.

594
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:34,062
Was anything that happened
between us real, any of it?

595
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:35,153
I did love you.

596
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:36,522
I still love you.

597
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:38,679
Life was a curse until I met you.

598
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,493
Since then, I've done whatever it takes

599
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:41,962
to stay alive for you.

600
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:44,665
All right, well, I want
you to do something then.

601
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:47,634
I want you to turn yourself in.

602
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:49,656
It's not happening.

603
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:51,715
Okay, we've got your guy here,

604
00:26:51,718 --> 00:26:54,034
and he is gonna crack.

605
00:26:54,037 --> 00:26:55,536
He's not gonna say anything.

606
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:57,944
He knows I can get to his sister.

607
00:26:57,946 --> 00:26:59,196
Chloe, you need to know.

608
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,598
No, I want you to know.

609
00:27:02,184 --> 00:27:05,751
One way or another, Pierce,
I am going to find you.

610
00:27:05,753 --> 00:27:07,486
I doubt that.

611
00:27:31,745 --> 00:27:34,012
It's okay. It's okay.

612
00:27:34,014 --> 00:27:35,747
How are you feeling?

613
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:37,916
I'm fine.

614
00:27:37,918 --> 00:27:40,785
Maze, you need to rest.

615
00:27:40,787 --> 00:27:44,956
No, I can't stay here.

616
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,058
Pierce is right.

617
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,988
Being on Earth...

618
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:51,391
around all these humans...

619
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,833
all these emotions, makes me weak.

620
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:57,802
You look like you fought ten people

621
00:27:57,804 --> 00:28:00,405
and ran a mile to get here.

622
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:02,507
12 people.

623
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,609
Four miles.

624
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:09,013
My point is...

625
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:13,017
you did that... for me.

626
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,671
To save me.

627
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:22,893
Emotions...

628
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:25,562
emotions are hard.

629
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,833
But that's why they make you strong.

630
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:32,820
And this is...

631
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:40,277
This is the strongest
I've ever seen you.

632
00:28:43,582 --> 00:28:44,782
Linda, I'm...

633
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:46,803
You don't have to say anything.

634
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:49,272
Your actions speak plenty.

635
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:53,790
Ah.

636
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:56,792
That's the thing.

637
00:28:56,794 --> 00:28:59,961
Actions are easy for me.

638
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:02,078
That's why I need to say it.

639
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:07,101
I'm sorry.

640
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:10,572
Me, too.

641
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:18,580
But I got to ask.

642
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:21,356
Is somebody really trying to kill me?

643
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,152
Don't worry.

644
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:27,221
You're safe.

645
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,101
Everything's gonna be fine.

646
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:55,293
I miss Charlotte.

647
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:57,736
So do I, Ms. Lopez.

648
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:00,231
I can't believe she's really gone.

649
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:04,970
And that Pierce would do what he did.

650
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,237
I know,

651
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,080
God works in mysterious ways,

652
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:12,114
and bad things happen for a reason.

653
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:16,025
But this many bad things,

654
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:17,682
I just...

655
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:20,785
I'm having a hard time
finding any reason.

656
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:23,253
Why would He do all this?

657
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,329
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this,

658
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:28,858
but I don't actually think

659
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:31,630
it's my Father's fault.

660
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,529
See, all this time I thought it was Him

661
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,084
pulling the strings.

662
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:37,460
I've started to realize that

663
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:40,744
we are the responsible parties.

664
00:30:40,747 --> 00:30:44,007
It's quite devious of
Him, if you think about it.

665
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:48,277
We've no one to blame but ourselves.

666
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,412
Screw that.

667
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,082
I blame Pierce.

668
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,220
And, Big Guy?

669
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:57,987
You and I are on rocky ground.

670
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,009
We know about your sister.

671
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:08,797
Yeah? Then you know why I'm not talking.

672
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,294
If you cooperate, we can protect her.

673
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:13,535
You can protect her?

674
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:15,938
I'm tied to a chair in a penthouse

675
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,098
above a nightclub.

676
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:18,838
You, him,

677
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,583
you can't protect anyone.

678
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:21,710
Where's your safe house?

679
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,112
The walk-in closet?

680
00:31:25,657 --> 00:31:27,157
That's what I thought.

681
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,120
Chloe, can I have a second
alone with him, please?

682
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:32,587
Can I leave you alone with him?

683
00:31:34,108 --> 00:31:35,908
Okay.

684
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:42,883
Oh, God, listen, save
whatever threats you think...

685
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:44,164
A corrupt cop.

686
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,317
What?

687
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,368
A corrupt cop.

688
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:52,273
That's what Pierce called me...

689
00:31:52,275 --> 00:31:53,674
when we first met.

690
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:58,679
And it pissed me off when he said it.

691
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,750
Well, you know what?

692
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:09,570
He was right.

693
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,363
I have stolen evidence.

694
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,968
I've had someone killed.

695
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,505
And I never regretted
it for a split second.

696
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:27,174
So if you're wondering,

697
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:30,903
would I kill the guy who
tried to murder me in my sleep?

698
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:32,573
With the gun

699
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,747
that killed the woman I love?

700
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:39,814
What do you think the answer is?

701
00:32:39,817 --> 00:32:42,723
My s... my sister,

702
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:44,723
Kelsey, she's...

703
00:32:44,726 --> 00:32:47,860
all I care about... The only thing.

704
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:51,384
So, if you can prove to me

705
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:55,401
that you can really... and I
mean really... protect her...

706
00:32:57,337 --> 00:32:59,270
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.

707
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:01,159
I... just...

708
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:04,333
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.

709
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:10,118
His sister's address.

710
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:13,283
Once we can prove she's safe,

711
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:15,521
he promised he'd give
us everything we need.

712
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:18,175
Okay, Lucifer and I will go get her.

713
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:20,312
You guys, stay here, keep an eye on him.

714
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:34,908
Right, the sister's loft
should be right up here.

715
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:36,010
All right.

716
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,112
Detective.

717
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,549
This is all my fault.

718
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:41,914
What? No, no, no, you can't
blame yourself for Pierce.

719
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:43,273
No, you were right.

720
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:44,775
You tried to warn me about him,

721
00:33:44,778 --> 00:33:45,919
and I didn't listen to you.

722
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:48,753
But... although, who could
believe anything you say?

723
00:33:48,756 --> 00:33:50,856
Angels, demons, immortal men.

724
00:33:50,858 --> 00:33:53,106
Detective, I always tell you the truth.

725
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:54,241
No.

726
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,503
You tell me your truth.

727
00:33:57,506 --> 00:33:58,838
And I know

728
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:02,166
that all of these metaphors,
they're real for you.

729
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:03,759
But I think...

730
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:05,937
I think humoring them

731
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:09,708
has just encouraged you, and
that's on me, but I'm done.

732
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,935
Detective.

733
00:34:10,938 --> 00:34:12,705
No more metaphors.

734
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,838
No more "devil" talk.

735
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:17,682
I've told you before,

736
00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:20,142
you may think that that's what you are,

737
00:34:20,152 --> 00:34:24,106
but... I don't see you that way.

738
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:30,694
Lately, I'm not sure I do, either.

739
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:40,003
All right, well, first things first.

740
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:41,278
- Right.
- Yeah.

741
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:42,308
Come on.

742
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:43,577
Okay.

743
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:47,023
Hello?

744
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:50,327
Kelsey, are you here?

745
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,348
Your brother sent us.

746
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,716
Are you sure?

747
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:56,645
- Okay. All right, thanks.
- What's going on?

748
00:34:56,648 --> 00:34:58,233
I called in a favor to Detroit PD.

749
00:34:58,236 --> 00:34:59,935
Had them run that
dude's prints on the DL.

750
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:01,028
Uh-huh. And...?

751
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:02,459
He's an only child.

752
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:03,827
There is no sister.

753
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:06,262
So that means that they're
walking into a trap.

754
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,809
Something doesn't feel right.

755
00:35:20,811 --> 00:35:22,614
I wouldn't do that, Chloe.

756
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,199
You don't have to do this, Pierce.

757
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:36,611
Yes, I do.

758
00:35:36,614 --> 00:35:39,950
And normally, I would just
skip town and reinvent myself.

759
00:35:39,953 --> 00:35:41,687
But this time, I can't.

760
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,366
Not before I kill Lucifer.

761
00:35:44,368 --> 00:35:45,568
What?

762
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,541
- Why?
- Because I know

763
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:49,377
that he'll never stop hunting me.

764
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,672
And I can't afford to spend

765
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:52,640
the rest of my days
looking over my shoulder.

766
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:54,345
But you don't have to die, Chloe.

767
00:35:54,348 --> 00:35:55,610
Step away from him.

768
00:35:55,612 --> 00:36:00,215
Detective, for once, I
agree with this imbecile.

769
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:02,817
Step aside.

770
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,997
No.

771
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,005
Detective.

772
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:07,356
Chloe.

773
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,801
I believed everything you said,

774
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:12,067
Marcus.

775
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,169
That you loved me.

776
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,252
That you did all of this for me.

777
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:18,566
Which is why I know

778
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:20,869
that you won't shoot.

779
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,650
You made me realize that
life is worth living.

780
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:28,442
And I will do anything to stay alive.

781
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:31,083
And if you get in the way of that...

782
00:36:31,086 --> 00:36:32,552
Okay.

783
00:36:32,555 --> 00:36:34,622
I believe you.

784
00:36:37,907 --> 00:36:40,140
I don't want to die.

785
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:44,590
I can't.

786
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:46,231
Not without stopping you.

787
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,923
No! No! Detective!

788
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:52,950
What? No, no, no, no, no, no.

789
00:36:52,953 --> 00:36:54,735
This... this can't happen.

790
00:36:54,737 --> 00:36:56,370
This...

791
00:37:00,937 --> 00:37:03,438
Finish it. Finish it!

792
00:37:04,914 --> 00:37:06,847
No!

793
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:03,868
What happened?

794
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,071
You're safe.

795
00:38:06,073 --> 00:38:07,469
That's all that matters.

796
00:38:07,472 --> 00:38:09,514
We need to find Pierce.

797
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:59,221
I guess it's just you and me now.

798
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:24,778
Dan?

799
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,272
Hey, Chloe, uh, it's a trap.

800
00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:27,815
Dan, I-I know.

801
00:39:27,817 --> 00:39:28,964
I know.

802
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,652
We had to find out the hard way.

803
00:39:30,655 --> 00:39:32,353
Pierce, he tried to kill us.

804
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:33,863
What? Are you okay?

805
00:39:33,866 --> 00:39:35,293
Yeah, I am. Is she okay?

806
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:37,335
I-I don't know how,

807
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,705
but I am.

808
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,408
Or maybe I do know.

809
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:46,191
Maybe I've been avoiding the
biggest truth this whole...

810
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,337
I have to go.

811
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:52,173
Chloe, don't go in there without backup.

812
00:39:56,612 --> 00:39:58,445
There's no point.

813
00:39:58,447 --> 00:40:00,815
The detective's a
safe distance away now.

814
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:04,685
Ah, that's good.

815
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:06,920
I came prepared.

816
00:40:06,922 --> 00:40:09,155
As I recall...

817
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:12,693
this can kill you pretty well.

818
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:18,131
A fair fight it is, then, Cain.

819
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,505
Someone's been working out.

820
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,328
I promised you...

821
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,598
that I would find a way to kill you.

822
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:07,991
I am a Devil of my word.

823
00:41:10,984 --> 00:41:12,250
Is Chloe okay?

824
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:17,955
She's fine.

825
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:20,258
No thanks to you.

826
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:27,543
Now that I know I'm dying,

827
00:41:27,546 --> 00:41:29,413
I don't know what I was so afraid of.

828
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:32,404
I'm going to Heaven.

829
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,978
You really believe that.

830
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:37,949
I told you, Lucifer, I don't
regret anything I've done.

831
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:42,531
Yes, but that was before you
killed Charlotte Richards.

832
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:43,933
No.

833
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,749
No, that was an accident.

834
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:47,384
Well, you pulled the trigger.

835
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:48,777
You ended her life.

836
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,854
You chose to kill her.

837
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:52,189
Oh...

838
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:53,702
Deep down,

839
00:41:53,705 --> 00:41:56,573
you know you're a monster.

840
00:41:56,576 --> 00:41:58,675
And that you belong in Hell,

841
00:41:58,678 --> 00:42:03,098
where you will torture yourself
with that truth for eternity.

842
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,370
'Cause no matter what you tell yourself,

843
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:11,507
you can't outrun what you've done.

844
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,778
What you truly are.

845
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:19,281
And neither can you.

846
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,423
Lucifer.

847
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:32,585
Lucifer.

848
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:39,768
It's all true.

849
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,337
Detective?

850
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:45,457
It's all true.
