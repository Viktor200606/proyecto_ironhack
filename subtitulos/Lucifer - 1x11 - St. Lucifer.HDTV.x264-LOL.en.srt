1
00:00:01,942 --> 00:00:06,047
- </i>Previously on Lucifer...</i>
- You're the Lord of Hell.

2
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:07,248
Amenadiel is right...

3
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:08,384
you are changing.

4
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:10,225
You betrayed me, Maze.

5
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:12,560
- Lucifer...
- I don't want to hear it. We're done.

6
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:14,267
Enjoying the life I gave you?

7
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:16,564
Do you want to go back?

8
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:19,100
Because I can make that happen.

9
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:22,237
Seems I'm dealing
with a bit of a mortality sitch.

10
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,405
I'm bleeding.

11
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:25,941
All I have to do is
wait for some pitiful thug

12
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,611
to end you, and
right back to Hell you go.

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,079
Who do you want me to kill?

14
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:34,215
Lucifer Morningstar deserves
everything he gets,

15
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:35,784
but I can't let you kill him.

16
00:00:38,654 --> 00:00:42,023
It would seem that I'm saying no.

17
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:43,325
Oh, God.

18
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:14,289
Oh, no.

19
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:17,492
No. No.

20
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:20,128
Oh, God.

21
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:22,297
Oh, God, what have I done?

22
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,568
Don't worry, my
father's the forgiving sort.

23
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:28,470
Well, except when it comes to me.

24
00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:31,306
Triple espresso or hair of the dog?

25
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:32,640
No.

26
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,908
Oh, right.

27
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:35,276
Both.

28
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:40,548
Please tell me, we didn't...

29
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:42,450
Did we ever.

30
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:45,553
And I'm pretty sure we
made Rosemary's baby.

31
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:47,922
Oh, Detective, it was extraordinary.

32
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,991
The heat, the gymnastics.

33
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:53,194
I mean, you had
moves that made even the Devil blush.

34
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:55,263
Oh, no, this is bad.

35
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,599
Whatever happened last night,

36
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,267
don't tell me, I'd rather not know.

37
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:00,695
What, that we didn't do the nasty?

38
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,271
We didn't?

39
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:05,073
Nope, I turned you down cold.

40
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,642
You, the guy who's been
trying to get me into the sack

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,112
since day one had a
chance to sleep with me,

42
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,113
and you did...?

43
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,415
Why-why am I naked?

44
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:14,682
What, you mean you
don't remember the part

45
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,818
where you passed out, woke up again,

46
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,121
shouted at me, "It's too hot
in this five-story hellhole,"

47
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:21,523
I believe it was,

48
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,025
then tore your clothes off and
proceeded to hog the bed?

49
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,427
I do that. Sometimes.

50
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,028
When I'm upset.

51
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:29,697
And you'd be upset, too, if
your ex dumped you by text.

52
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,633
No, I'd be relieved if Dan dumped me.

53
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,068
Even still,

54
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:35,170
it's very out of
character to see you so unhinged.

55
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,439
And out of character for me, too.

56
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:39,607
The whole "not wanting to
have sex with you" thing.

57
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:41,342
I mean, here's the strange part.

58
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,812
This gave me quite a rush.

59
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,979
Can't explain it.

60
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,948
I've been thinking about it all night.

61
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:49,951
Okay, last night was a fluke.

62
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:51,319
For both of us.

63
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:53,788
Never happened, leave it at that.

64
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:54,756
Right.

65
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:59,027
You snore, by the way.

66
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,562
Like an Albanian field wench!

67
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:10,538
Did you finally seal the
deal with your little detective?

68
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:14,275
If we were on speaking
terms, perhaps I'd fill you in.

69
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:15,310
Where are you going?

70
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:16,578
Why do you ask?

71
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:18,780
You still reporting back to my brother?

72
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,014
Lucifer...

73
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:21,282
No, do me a favor, Maze.

74
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,284
How about you let me lead my life,

75
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:25,553
and I'll let you lead yours, deal?

76
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,789
You can't be mad at me forever.

77
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:30,325
Oh, but I can.

78
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:32,494
It's one of the
luxuries of being the Devil.

79
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:43,304
Detective, I believe you left these

80
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,039
after our sleepover last night.

81
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:46,774
What's the hole at the back for?

82
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:47,742
Not mine.

83
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,810
Those are not mine.

84
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:50,745
More of a commando girl.

85
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,013
Fair enough.

86
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,281
Dearie me.

87
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,850
Someone woke up on
the wrong side of a .38.

88
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:58,686
Yeah, single gunshot
wound to the chest.

89
00:03:58,754 --> 00:03:59,854
No wallet.

90
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:02,557
Tan marks where a ring
and a watch were lifted.

91
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,292
A staircase robbery.

92
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,394
Is that a thing now?

93
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:07,982
This is the Dunlear Foundation.

94
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,265
They help the homeless
and the underprivileged.

95
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,534
So, who's the dashing corpse?

96
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:15,537
Tim Dunlear himself, head
of the foundation,

97
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:18,540
former NBA star, notorious playboy.

98
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,009
He was into drugs, gambling, women.

99
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:22,410
My typical Wednesday.

100
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,413
But then he left pro ball and
he turned his life around.

101
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,149
He dedicated himself to philanthropy.

102
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:29,417
He was beloved.

103
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:32,420
Right, bad boy turned good.

104
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,022
It's interesting.

105
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,290
Are you Emmett Toussaint?

106
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:36,691
You found the body?

107
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,526
I'm Detective Decker. Can
you tell us what happened?

108
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:41,963
I volunteer for the foundation's
outreach program.

109
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,999
Came here to meet him, and
he was just lying here.

110
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,434
How did you know Mr. Dunlear?

111
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:49,304
He sponsored me to come to
L.A. after the earthquake in Haiti.

112
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:50,872
Tim was my mentor.

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,674
Handsome and saintly.

114
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:54,181
Did you see anyone else at the scene

115
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,376
or notice anything strange?

116
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:57,378
There was a guy outside.

117
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:59,113
He ran when he saw me.

118
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:00,782
I gave the cops a description.

119
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,150
Think he was homeless.

120
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:06,254
Did Mr. Dunlear ever speak of
a certain philanthropic high

121
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:07,956
after one of his selfless acts?

122
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:09,290
You know, for example,

123
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,826
say when he chose not to
sleep with a drunken woman?

124
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,963
What?

125
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,030
Did I say something wrong?

126
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,933
We are questioning a minor.

127
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:22,670
I'm sorry about your mentor.

128
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:25,206
We'll call you if we have
any more questions.

129
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,044
What? I just feel quite connected

130
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,846
to our victim.

131
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,282
You are nothing like Tim Dunlear.

132
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,150
Bad boy with a heart of gold?

133
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:37,685
I am everything like Tim.

134
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:39,354
May as well be solving my own murder.

135
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,356
Only you could turn a tragic death

136
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:43,825
into an excuse to talk about you.

137
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,629
Well, who else would I talk about?

138
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:51,833
Got these on sale.

139
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,003
Extra strong, UV resistant,

140
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,372
and still 30% off.

141
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:02,710
Do you really think
you're gonna get away with this?

142
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,646
Probably not.

143
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:06,414
I'll bet the SWAT team's about

144
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:09,417
to bust down the door any minute.

145
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:10,685
Not like there's much else going on

146
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:13,855
in a city of four million people.

147
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:17,859
As much as I hate Lucifer, I'm
not gonna let you kill him.

148
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:20,595
Oh, I'm not gonna do anything. No. Oh.

149
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,165
But you know who would want him dead?

150
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,301
Someone who's jealous.

151
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:27,835
Someone who hates the fact

152
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:30,905
that he's clearly got a
thing for his ex-wife.

153
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,809
Ooh.

154
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:38,880
Someone whose fingerprints I
put all over the murder weapon.

155
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:40,481
Sound like anyone you know, Dan?

156
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:42,684
Ooh.

157
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,536
Don't go anywhere.

158
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,222
My husband was so generous.

159
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:57,699
If they had just asked for help,

160
00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:59,000
he would have given them anything.

161
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:02,103
What kind of person
would do something like this?

162
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,638
Well, how much time do you have?

163
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:06,841
Tim would be devastated to
know we've got to cancel

164
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:07,809
the fund-raising gala.

165
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:09,077
You're right, Kyle.

166
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:11,646
Well, we wouldn't want to
devastate our fallen hero.

167
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,448
The show must go on.

168
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:14,715
This is an active crime scene.

169
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,018
We can't have an event here.

170
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,286
No, that wouldn't be right.

171
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,154
Well, I just happen to own

172
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,689
the preeminent party
venue in Los Angeles.

173
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:24,392
You can hold your benefit at my club.

174
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,827
- I don't know.
- No, no, your husband

175
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:27,095
was a kindred spirit,

176
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:29,364
and I pledge to carry on his good work

177
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:33,101
and personally find...
and punish... his killer.

178
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:36,371
Tim always said "Tragedy brings sorrow

179
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:37,972
but also true good."

180
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,973
Aw.

181
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,708
Thank you.

182
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,210
You are so welcome.

183
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:48,416
If this was a robbery, our
perp's gonna want to cash in

184
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:50,418
before the cops get wind of this,

185
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,186
so I'll call the local pawn shops...

186
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:54,856
What is with you today?

187
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,163
It was rather benevolent of me,

188
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:57,925
offering up Lux, don't you think?

189
00:07:57,993 --> 00:07:59,360
Well, one good deed doesn't
make you a saint.

190
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,829
Well, last I counted,
it was two good deeds.

191
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:04,565
But, uh, I'm not
feeling the same rush as before.

192
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,367
Perhaps I'm gonna have to up my game.

193
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:09,103
Whatever you say, St. Lucifer.

194
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,572
Oh, "St. Lucifer."

195
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:14,575
Suits me, don't you think?

196

197
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:29,501
It's funny, I've always
looked at do-gooders with pity.

198
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,953
Little did I know their dirty secret.

199
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,822
And what's that?

200
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,191
- Feels good to do good.
- Yes.

201
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:39,895
Good deeds do bring an
amount of personal satisfaction

202
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:41,196
to those who engage in them.

203
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:44,733
No, but I mean it's
like a literal rush, a high.

204
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:48,303
Have you ever mixed
cocaine and Molly with Pop Rocks?

205
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:50,305
It's nothing like
that. I'm just curious.

206
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:54,209
So you're feeling good about
not sleeping with Detective Decker.

207
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:56,878
Well, yes, and offering
Lux to the Dunlear Foundation,

208
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:59,247
not to mention
vowing to find Tim's killer.

209
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,983
You've identified
quite strongly with this man.

210
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,252
Yes. Yes, a man of honor, principle.

211
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,122
Hmm. You like the way being
good makes you feel.

212
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,423
- Mm.
- But true good needs

213
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:12,461
to come from a place of
selflessness, authenticity.

214
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:13,729
Well, of course.

215
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:16,498
I authentically want
people to applaud the real me.

216
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:18,033
The Devil gets a terrible rap.

217
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:21,937
So you care about
image, how you look to others.

218
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:23,438
And you're welcome.

219
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:28,110
Okay, my point is, it's wonderful
that you're evolving.

220
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:28,944
Right.

221
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:31,613
But goodness isn't a toy.

222
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:34,449
Well, the way I'm
going to play with it, it is.

223
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:42,290
I'm in between gigs.

224
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:45,627
I'm no thief, I'm an
actor, Louie DelGado.

225
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:49,398
I had an arc on Party
of Five, look me up.

226
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:52,167
I love L.A. Even the
homeless have an IMDb page.

227
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:53,402
You care to explain why you were

228
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,470
caught pawning Tim
Dunlear's championship ring?

229
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:57,939
Listen, more importantly, why
did you take it to a pawnshop?

230
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,741
The Dark Web has much better margins.

231
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:01,062
I swear I didn't do nothing.

232
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,234
Witnesses put you at the scene.

233
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,146
You're telling me this
wasn't a robbery gone wrong?

234
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,815
He was already dead, been
like that for a bit.

235
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:08,617
Rigor mortis had set in.

236
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:11,219
I also did a guest spot on CSI.

237
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:12,087
Ah.

238
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:14,089
Tim was my buddy,

239
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:17,159
one of the few people who treated
me like a human being.

240
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:19,127
Would your buddy have
approved of you stealing valuables

241
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:21,163
from his cold dead corpse?

242
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,898
Tim didn't care about stuff.

243
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:25,600
Would have wanted me to have that ring.

244
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:26,802
Give you the shirt off his back.

245
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:27,803
What about his wallet?

246
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,072
Uh, I was gonna return that.

247
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,909
Some kind of key card.

248
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:35,143
I have an alibi.

249
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:36,311
I was at a shelter on 7th.

250
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,113
Uh-huh. Keep an eye on Louie.

251
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,582
I'm gonna see if his story checks out.

252
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:47,756
I also know what it's
like to be without a home.

253
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:49,191
My father kicked me out.

254
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:51,226
It's very traumatic.

255
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:55,263
But, much like Tim Dunlear, I'd
like to do whatever it takes

256
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:58,233
to help you, so,
here, the shirt off my back.

257
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,602
Yeah.

258
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,137
And, uh, as you can see,

259
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,773
the Devil does indeed wear Prada.

260
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:07,008
Wow, thanks, brother.

261
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:08,643
Yes, disastrous

262
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,645
with those trousers, though.

263
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:11,646
Oh, what the hell?

264
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,348
As gratitude for telling us

265
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,885
everything you know.

266
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,156
And he's naked.

267
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,390
Another act

268
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,692
of selfless benevolence.

269
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,693
It's quite liberating, actually.

270
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,961
Oh, don't forget.

271
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:27,429
Dry-clean only.

272
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:28,563
His story checks out.

273
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:29,698
We need to get a full written statement.

274
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:31,199
And get our guy some lunch, okay?

275
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:32,434
No-no gluten

276
00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:34,402
or-or dairy, okay?

277
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:37,506
Another good deed

278
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,374
but still no rush like before.

279
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:40,675
Am I doing this wrong?

280
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,444
In so many ways.

281
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:43,879
Oh?

282
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:46,214
You're not getting in my car like that.

283
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,986
Meet you at mine?

284
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:58,059
So, who do we suspect
of this grisly murder?

285
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:00,462
Maybe Mr. Dunlear wasn't
as saintly as he appeared.

286
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,765
Who knows who or
what he was involved with?

287
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,201
He wasn't always such a good man.

288
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:07,335
It's hard to shake your true nature.

289
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:08,770
Well, not really. Look at me.

290
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:10,472
Oh, no, I saw plenty.

291
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,907
- Thank you.
- Cheeky.

292
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:14,543
Oh, Lucifer, Detective.

293
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,844
I wasn't expecting you.

294
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:17,552
Yes, we have a few
more questions for you.

295
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,248
Yes, how are you holding up?

296
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:21,783
Doing my best.

297
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:22,691
One moment at a time.

298
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:23,952
Mrs. Dunlear,

299
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,086
can you think of any personal reason

300
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:26,955
why someone would
want to kill your husband?

301
00:12:27,023 --> 00:12:28,790
I thought this was a robbery.

302
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:30,091
No, turns out

303
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,960
your husband was dead before
our homeless thespian

304
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:33,929
pilfered his valuables.

305
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:34,930
Did Tim have any enemies?

306
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:36,598
Anyone that would want to hurt him?

307
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,632
No, absolutely not.

308
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,833
Everybody loved Tim.

309
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:40,101
Will Fleming...

310
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:42,404
counsel for the
foundation and the Dunlears.

311
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,672
This won't
take long, Mr. Fleming.

312
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,240
Well, you're absolutely correct,

313
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:46,575
because my client is done here.

314
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,709
- Wha...?
- Oh.

315
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:48,810
Actually I'm

316
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:50,845
just here to talk to Vanessa

317
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:52,280
about the gala... is that, uh,

318
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:53,868
is that all right? Are you up to that?

319
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,150
Yes, of course.

320
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:56,251
Lovely.

321
00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,687
So I know it's not a good time, Vanessa.

322
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:01,022
But I want to discuss...

323
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,791
My client is grieving.

324
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:04,159
You have any questions, you talk to me.

325
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:05,527
All right, can you establish

326
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:07,929
Vanessa's whereabouts
at the time of Tim's death?

327
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:09,437
Are you accusing my client of murder?

328
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:12,634
No, but one quarter of murders
are committed by family members.

329
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:14,703
Yes, and half by acquaintances.

330
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,171
Which gets to my next question.

331
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:17,838
Where were you the night of Tim's death?

332
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,473
Listen, you can look at me all you want.

333
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,577
But Tim came into contact with
a lot of people around this place.

334
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:24,279
Desperate people.

335
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:27,716
Why do I get the feeling you
have someone specific in mind?

336
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:29,918
Did you ever fight with Tim?

337
00:13:32,588 --> 00:13:34,723
Last night.

338
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,891
You didn't tell me that earlier.

339
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,360
I was ashamed.

340
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:40,261
Tim told me I might not be receiving

341
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:42,864
the scholarship money he promised.

342
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:44,399
I got angry.

343
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:49,037
Said some things.

344
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,806
I was going to go apologize, but...

345
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,175
when I got there...

346
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:56,411
I'm gonna need to test
you for gunshot residue.

347
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,613
And get a full written statement.

348
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:01,049
Whatever you need.

349
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:05,587
First, I want you to tell me more about

350
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:06,855
Tim and his relationship

351
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:09,057
with Vanessa... what was it like?

352
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,959
Great...

353
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:12,727
when the cameras were on.

354
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:14,929
And when they were off?

355
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,867
Ah, Detective, you made it.

356
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,802
A little underdressed, but okay.

357
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,737
What happened with the orphan child?

358
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,673
We're holding him, waiting
on ballistics.

359
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,542
But he had a lot to say about
the Dunlears' perfect marriage.

360
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,145
Apparently Tim hadn't slept
at home in months.

361
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:31,680
Well, it's probably
all those good deeds.

362
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,314
So time-consuming.

363
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:35,116
Or... I was right.

364
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:36,584
And Tim was back to his old ways.

365
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:38,119
You know, that key
card we found in his wallet

366
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,355
was from a hotel, so maybe
he was cheating on Vanessa,

367
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:41,890
she found out,

368
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:43,525
- then decided to...
- Punish the cheating bastard

369
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,893
by pumping him full of lead.

370
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,428
Well, that's option "A."

371
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:48,196
Option "B" is the lawyer isn't
telling us everything he knows.

372
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:49,431
Option "C" is

373
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:51,433
an emotionally
distraught mistress did him in.

374
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,868
Ah, that old chestnut... if
I can't have him, no one can.

375
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,170
What did you get from Vanessa?

376
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:56,438
- Is that why we're here?
- Yes, yes.

377
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:57,572
She asked me to have lunch

378
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,340
with the golden donors of the foundation

379
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:00,742
on her behalf.

380
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,943
It's the least I could do.

381
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:03,278
Oh, the very least.

382
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:05,714
What better way to get
intel on a murder than a gaggle

383
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,182
of high-society frenemies?

384
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:08,650
- Oh.
- Ah!

385
00:15:08,718 --> 00:15:10,318
Tim Dunlear

386
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:11,853
was a true humanitarian.

387
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:13,888
Oh, there's so few of us around.

388
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,756
And I have no one to
help me process my grief.

389
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,559
Can you believe my
therapist had the nerve

390
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,626
to go on maternity leave?

391
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,762
Oh, well, I'm here for you, Gayle.

392
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,964
You can tell me anything.

393
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:24,599
Oh.

394
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:25,734
Oh, ooh...

395
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:29,637
You are a good man.

396
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:31,239
Yeah, not quite the reaction

397
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:34,342
I was looking for, but,
uh, when in Rome.

398
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,477
To Tim Dunlear.

399
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:37,078
We all loved him.

400
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,881
Mm-hmm, some more than others.

401
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,616
So you heard about Donna Gray?

402
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:43,451
- Oh, yeah.
- So sad.

403
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,887
Throwing yourself at a
married man like that.

404
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,689
Mm, and when they
started sleeping together,

405
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:49,724
poor Vanessa.

406
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,793
Tim turned Donna down cold.

407
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:53,628
Not that it's any

408
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:55,096
of your business.

409
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,498
Oh.

410
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:00,535
Tight-lipped and angry.

411
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:02,137
Yes, well, with all that Botox,

412
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:04,539
I'm surprised she can chew at all.

413
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,008
This is taking too long...
maybe we should do your hypnotism,

414
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:09,027
eye-voodoo thing to get them talking.

415
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:09,701
Yes.

416
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:12,013
You would expect that sort of
behavior from me, wouldn't you?

417
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:14,149
Yeah, you making a
spectacle to help out a case.

418
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,550
Yeah, it's what you do.

419
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:17,552
Don't worry, Detective.
There'll be a spectacle.

420
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,187
These women

421
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:21,689
are lonely and unappreciated.

422
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:24,292
If I give them what they
want, they'll give us what we want.

423
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,661
Hello, ladies.

424
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:30,064
Thank you all so much for coming today.

425
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:32,167
Uh, you've all given so
generously over the years

426
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,335
to the Dunlear Foundation.

427
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:36,437
In honor of our fallen hero,

428
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:38,072
I now give you a gift

429
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,180
in return.

430
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:40,875
Me.

431
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,113

Why-why are you enjoying yourselves?!

448
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:29,724
Tim is dead!

449
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,659
Shame on you.

450
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:34,495
And shame on all of you.

451
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:40,235
And I give you option "D."

452
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:41,870
Let's go.

453
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,115
- I love you.
- Thank you.

454
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,249
It's true.

455
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,666
I loved him.

456
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:55,599
Kyle, Tim Dunlear was
a hero to all of us.

457
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:56,594
No, no.

458
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,796
You don't understand.

459
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:02,867
Tim and I were in love.

460
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,569
- Oh.
- Oh.

461
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:06,204
Right,

462
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,673
so Tim was cheating on
his wife with a man.

463
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,274
I did not see that coming.

464
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,443
The Devil usually has impeccable gaydar.

465
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:15,012
Tim was, uh, in denial

466
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,215
about his sexuality for years.

467
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:20,451
And then, um...

468
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,153
we met.

469
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:24,255
Hmm, that explains
why he was never at home

470
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:25,756
and all the secrecy.

471
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:27,625
Did you two ever meet at a hotel?

472
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:29,060
No.

473
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:30,761
No, that-that would've been too public.

474
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:33,898
Uh, we only ever met at my apartment.

475
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,333
Huh. What about Vanessa?

476
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,501
Did she know?

477
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:38,169
They, um,

478
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:39,604
you know, they-they had an arrangement.

479
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:42,306
Tim wanted it kept secret.

480
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:44,509
And Vanessa agreed.

481
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:47,945
She needed the Tim Dunlear brand.

482
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:49,947
Monogamy fails again.

483
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:51,449
So, if Tim didn't want
out of the closet,

484
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:54,152
were you aware of anyone
that would want to blackmail him?

485
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,053
Or threaten to go to the press?

486
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:57,221
No.

487
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:58,256
Um...

488
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,226
But Tim texted me this photo

489
00:19:02,294 --> 00:19:03,461
for safekeeping.

490
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:05,730
I... I have no idea

491
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:08,099
what it means.

492
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,635
- Hmm.
- It's actually the last I ever

493
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:12,770
heard from him before...

494
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:18,075
Do you want another song?

495
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:23,414
If there's one thing I
know about kimchi fried rice,

496
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:27,885
it's that heat really kicks
things up a notch.

497
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:30,221
You almost died. You came back,

498
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,169
and this is what you do
with your second chance?

499
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:38,729
You know what happens when you die?

500
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:40,932
I can't say I do.

501
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,568
Well, if you've lived a life

502
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:46,504
like I did, you go to Hell.

503
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:47,805
Oh, yeah.

504
00:19:47,873 --> 00:19:50,942
In my case, it was
for a couple of seconds.

505
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:54,378
Down there, though, it was years...

506
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:56,080
and years.

507
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:57,815
And there's a door just for you.

508
00:19:57,883 --> 00:20:00,051
And inside, Hell

509
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:02,753
uses what you love against you.

510
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:06,023
For me, I love life.

511
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:09,093
Everything about
it. Got a hunger for it.

512
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:11,462
So...

513
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,631
they starved me.

514
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:15,466
No food.

515
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:17,268
No other people.

516
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:18,603
No nothing.

517
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,438
No TV.

518
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:22,006
Malcolm?

519
00:20:22,074 --> 00:20:23,407
Hmm?

520
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:24,875
You need help.

521
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:34,418
You always were a scrappy one.

522
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:37,288
Ah.

523
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,824
Yeah.

524
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:42,526
I do need help.

525
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:44,595
Never to go back.

526
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:45,997
So I made a deal.

527
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:47,832
And all I got to do

528
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,434
is put a bullet in Lucifer.

529
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:52,770
I pull the trigger.

530
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,974
You take the fall.

531
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,177
Huh?

532
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,714
Huh? Huh?

533
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:14,759
Five-second rule.

534
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:25,303
Teaching,

535
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,104
building,

536
00:21:27,172 --> 00:21:28,673
creating.

537
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,107
I'm Tim Dunlear.

538
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:31,676
Together we can educate Haiti today

539
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:34,011
for their better tomorrow.

540
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:46,424
Mr. Fleming?

541
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:47,825
What are you doing here?

542
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,327
I understand you've been asking

543
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,195
some pretty invasive questions
at a luncheon.

544
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:53,264
I have reason to
believe that your client

545
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:56,033
knows more than she's letting
on about her husband's death.

546
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:58,035
Vanessa Dunlear's entire
world has fallen apart.

547
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:00,638
I mean, what kind of a
person targets a-a grieving woman?

548
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:02,406
A very rich grieving woman

549
00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:04,175
who stands to
inherit her husband's estate.

550
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:07,678
Every cent that Tim had goes
back into that foundation.

551
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:10,614
Which you would know,

552
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:12,883
because now that Tim's
gone, you took control.

553
00:22:12,951 --> 00:22:14,485
That's an interesting turn of events.

554
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:16,654
You are messing with the
wrong people, Detective.

555
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:18,522
Good people.

556
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,724
Back off.

557
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:30,434
You'd never know that Lux
was a den of iniquity, would you?

558
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:33,304
Well, as long as you don't look
too closely at the floors.

559
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:35,439
Will Fleming wants to scare me off?

560
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:36,907
Bring it on.

561
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:39,377
Question is, whether he's protecting
himself or Vanessa.

562
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:42,046
Or maybe they're just good people.

563
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:43,594
Because you're suddenly the authority?

564
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:44,615
Give me a break.

565
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:47,852
Detective, even if Vanessa is guilty,

566
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,721
this is a woman who's
denied herself carbs since the '90s

567
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:52,102
and stayed married to a gay man.

568
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:54,091
If she doesn't want to talk, she won't.

569
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,926
And as for their attorney,

570
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:57,394
well, he certainly doesn't strike me

571
00:22:57,396 --> 00:22:58,929
as the confessional type. Okay.

572
00:22:58,997 --> 00:23:01,499
Maybe I can't get them
to talk, but you can.

573
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:02,500
Come on.

574
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:03,634
I've seen you do it dozens of times.

575
00:23:03,702 --> 00:23:04,635
No.

576
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:06,437
Not here. Not tonight.

577
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:07,772
Am I missing something?

578
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,940
I feel like you're
protecting our main suspects.

579
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:11,909
No, I'm just
thinking about the children.

580
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:15,312
You want to push pause on
a murder investigation

581
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,914
so you can have a party?

582
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:18,315
Detective, I made a promise.

583
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:20,551
The ladies, the-the foundation,

584
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:22,820
the proud nation of Haiti...

585
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:24,355
they're all depending on me

586
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:25,556
tonight.

587
00:23:25,624 --> 00:23:27,391
Now, Tim Dunlear may be dead,

588
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,659
but his legacy lives on,

589
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:31,195
and right now he needs
to go change into his tux.

590
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:34,131
It's about the greater good, Detective.

591
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:37,034
The greater good would
be parking your ego

592
00:23:37,102 --> 00:23:39,703
and helping catch the bad guy.

593
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,172
The old Lucifer would have known that.

594
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,306
Wh...

595
00:23:42,374 --> 00:23:44,275
I miss him, by the way.

596
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:47,812
At least he had my back.

597
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:52,116
Detective!

598
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:04,267
Oh...

599
00:24:04,637 --> 00:24:07,883
Glad someone's having a good night.

600
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:12,054
What are you doing here?

601
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:14,256
You've ruined my life.

602
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:17,059
The least I could do is ruin your night.

603
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:20,062
Enjoy your evening.

604
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,396
How'd you even find me, Maze?

605
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,899
Followed the sweet stench of failure.

606
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:27,462
Look, don't blame me for
your problems, all right?

607
00:24:27,504 --> 00:24:28,570
It's not my fault

608
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:30,139
that you betrayed your boss.

609
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:33,675
My problems are your problems.

610
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:36,345
Which would be the only thing
that you and I have in common.

611
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:37,780
And so you came here because...

612
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,016
because you have

613
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:42,217
nowhere else to go?

614
00:24:42,285 --> 00:24:44,353
Yes, I do.

615
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,255
I have lots of places to go.

616
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,490
Lots of places.

617
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,160
And because you have no
one else to talk to, either.

618
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:54,029
Says the angel sitting here

619
00:24:54,097 --> 00:24:56,298
eating a medium rare steak

620
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:57,866
by himself.

621
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,411
What?

622
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,413
It's not like you
were going to drink it.

623
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:12,414
You're so boring.

624
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:14,183
I'm actually not boring.

625
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,385
I'm pretty exciting.

626
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:23,492
My definition of "excitement"

627
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,093
is fun.

628
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,862
Danger.

629
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,297
Sex.

630
00:25:29,232 --> 00:25:30,532
Spontaneity.

631
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,601
You are none of those things.

632
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:37,039
Yes, I am.

633
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:38,640
Give me one example.

634
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:44,980
You know that story about
Lucifer and the goat?

635
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:47,449
Yeah?

636
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:50,719
No.

637
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:53,088
That was you?

638
00:25:53,156 --> 00:25:54,389
That was me.

639
00:25:54,457 --> 00:25:55,524
A whisper here,

640
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:58,827
a divine appearance there...

641
00:25:58,895 --> 00:26:00,729
Word got around.

642
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:02,130
He hates the goat thing.

643
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:03,198
I know!

644
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:04,733
He could never figure out

645
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:06,201
where it came from.

646
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:09,104
You know, I've waited a
thousand years to tell someone that.

647
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:17,646
Leave the bottle.

648
00:26:22,112 --> 00:26:24,686
Thanks for this, Kyle. I
know it's your job on the line.

649
00:26:24,754 --> 00:26:25,787
Whatever it takes.

650
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:29,224
I want to find who did this.

651
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:31,660
Thank you.

652
00:26:33,463 --> 00:26:36,365
So this here, this last text from Tim...

653
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:37,733
looks like it was from
Port-au-Prince.

654
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,067
Tim didn't tell me

655
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:40,469
he was going there.

656
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:41,937
It wasn't on his calendar.

657
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:45,841
Could he have traveled under the radar?

658
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,912
Sometimes he booked his own travel.

659
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:51,179
He-he had some buddies

660
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:52,314
who own private jets.

661
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:53,715
Sometimes they would travel as a group.

662
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:55,550
So if Tim stayed in a hotel there,

663
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:57,058
maybe that's why he had the key card.

664
00:26:57,086 --> 00:26:58,086
Third-world technology.

665
00:26:58,154 --> 00:26:59,154
Maybe that's why

666
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:01,256
we couldn't read the magnetic strip.

667
00:27:01,324 --> 00:27:03,425
We do charity work in Port-au-Prince.

668
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:05,827
We raised money to buy
land to build a school.

669
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:08,130
Maybe that's what the
text of the barren field was.

670
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:09,597
That photo was from a few days ago.

671
00:27:09,632 --> 00:27:12,200
The school would be almost
finished by now.

672
00:27:13,603 --> 00:27:15,604
Unless it was never built.

673
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:19,141
Unless the money the foundation raised

674
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,610
went somewhere else.

675
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:25,614
Or to someone else.

676
00:27:39,362 --> 00:27:41,763
Really?

677
00:27:41,831 --> 00:27:43,999
That's your move?

678
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:46,234
You were planning to seduce me?

679
00:27:46,302 --> 00:27:48,236
That is... truly desperate.

680
00:27:48,304 --> 00:27:50,138
I'm not here to seduce you, Will.

681
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:52,708
But I do know what you desire.

682
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:55,844
What is it you think I desire,

683
00:27:55,912 --> 00:27:57,546
Detective?

684
00:27:57,613 --> 00:27:58,680
To do good.

685
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:00,382
To help people.

686
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,384
I did some research into you, Will,

687
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:03,785
and apparently, you don't charge

688
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:06,121
for your services here
at the foundation.

689
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:07,255
I make a nice living,

690
00:28:07,323 --> 00:28:08,690
thanks to my corporate work.

691
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:10,459
Yeah, you protect your
clients like a bulldog,

692
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:12,561
but underneath it all, you're
a big softie, aren't you?

693
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:15,964
I don't need to take
money away from those kids.

694
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:17,766
No.

695
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,101
But Vanessa does.

696
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:20,035
What the hell does that mean?

697
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:21,303
I looked into a school

698
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:22,604
that was supposed to be built

699
00:28:22,672 --> 00:28:24,272
with the foundation's
money in Port-au-Prince.

700
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:28,210
It doesn't exist.

701
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:30,545
What?

702
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:31,933
I think the money went elsewhere.

703
00:28:31,948 --> 00:28:34,449
After all, Vanessa had a
hell of an expensive lifestyle

704
00:28:34,517 --> 00:28:36,718
to keep up after her
husband left the NBA.

705
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:38,186
That is ridiculous.

706
00:28:38,254 --> 00:28:41,490
Besides, non-profit financials
are a matter of public record.

707
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:42,824
They are.

708
00:28:42,892 --> 00:28:44,626
But they're so
complicated, it would be pretty easy

709
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:47,062
to hide a few outgoing wire transfers.

710
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,997
Here. I think Tim Dunlear

711
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,766
looked into these
financials and figured it out.

712
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:53,201
So he flew to Pout Au
Prince to see for himself,

713
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,336
and when he realized

714
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:55,937
where the money went,

715
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,706
he confronted Vanessa

716
00:28:57,774 --> 00:28:59,307
and she killed him.

717
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,977
That is pure speculation.

718
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:02,978
It is.

719
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:04,479
So help me get proof.

720
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:06,648
If Vanessa transferred money to herself,

721
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:08,517
it'll show up in her personal
financial records,

722
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:10,385
which you have access to.

723
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:12,220
You want me to violate my client's trust

724
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:13,488
based on a hunch?

725
00:29:13,556 --> 00:29:15,624
You took this job to make a difference.

726
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:18,160
This foundation can still do good

727
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,028
the way Tim wanted it to.

728
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:21,596
If you help me.

729
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:07,676
Detective.

730
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:08,577
Is that you?

731
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:10,612
Hope you've come to your senses.

732
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,115
Well, that depends on
who you ask, Mr. Morningstar.

733
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,851
I'm here to murder you.

734
00:30:17,153 --> 00:30:20,255
Well... that is a buzzkill.

735
00:30:25,677 --> 00:30:26,608
I'm sorry.

736
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:27,876
Strange, disheveled gunman,

737
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:29,044
have we met?

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:31,012
Briefly.

739
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,681
Detective Malcolm Graham.

740
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,316
Ah, yes, of course!

741
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:35,684
The infamous Malcolm.

742
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,053
Tough times?

743
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,220
You here to steal my watch?

744
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:40,555
Well, there's no need.

745
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:43,158
You've caught me in a charitable mood.

746
00:30:43,225 --> 00:30:44,545
You could also use a decent suit.

747
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,760
The closet's that way.

748
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:46,961
Thanks.

749
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,496
I'm still going to kill you.

750
00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:49,831
Ah...

751
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:51,866
I should also mention
that if you pull that trigger,

752
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,469
it's a one-way ticket
to eternal damnation.

753
00:30:54,537 --> 00:30:55,470
Hell?

754
00:30:56,372 --> 00:30:58,406
Oh, I'm not going to Hell.

755
00:30:58,474 --> 00:30:59,641
Now or ever again.

756
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:00,642
No?

757
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,111
See, I made a deal with an angel.

758
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,747
And I've got orders to take you out.

759
00:31:05,815 --> 00:31:07,749
Your ass for mine.

760
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,187
Sorry, it's...

761
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:15,290
My holier-than-thou brother
has hired someone to kill me?

762
00:31:15,358 --> 00:31:17,492
Well, this really is Opposite
Day, isn't it?

763
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:20,595
You know what, Malcolm?

764
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:24,532
It's nighttime now.

765
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,836
It's funny how things seem
so much clearer in the dark.

766
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,575
Is that all you got?

767
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:36,578
Interesting.

768
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,981
Most people wet themselves when
they see my nastier side.

769
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,316
Huh.

770
00:31:41,384 --> 00:31:43,318
Well, most people
haven't been to Hell and back.

771
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,488
Rumor says

772
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:48,089
you're not immortal anymore.

773
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,392
That if I pull this trigger,

774
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:52,093
it's bye-bye, Devil.

775
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,395
Of course.

776
00:31:53,462 --> 00:31:55,463
Right. And what do you get in return,

777
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:56,498
Malcolm?

778
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:58,199
Your brother doesn't kill me.

779
00:31:58,267 --> 00:32:01,169
I stay out of Hell, live out my life.

780
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:02,737
I love life.

781
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:09,477
You've been duped, Malcolm.

782
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:10,378
Huh?

783
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:12,113
Angels can't take a mortal life.

784
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,281
It's Dad's rules.

785
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,183
Sorry.

786
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:18,520
And even if you do kill me...

787
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:20,388
what happens when you do die?

788
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:23,458
Because you will... eventually.

789
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,260
You'll still go back to Hell, Malcolm.

790
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:26,394
There's nothing

791
00:32:26,462 --> 00:32:29,297
that my brother can do to prevent that.

792
00:32:33,102 --> 00:32:34,169
What's that?

793
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:35,637
This?

794
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,906
This is my Pentecostal coin.

795
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:42,310
It's a subway token for
the damned, if you will.

796
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:46,314
I was going to use it to
get back to Hell eventually.

797
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:49,851
I suppose you could use
it to get out of Hell, too.

798
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,288
Could come in handy
for someone like you,

799
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:54,756
don't you think, Malcolm?

800
00:32:58,627 --> 00:33:01,496
It's all yours if you don't shoot me.

801
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,800
One-time offer.

802
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,134
There you are.

803
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:15,837
Can't very well start our
party without our guest of honor.

804
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:16,938
Mrs. Dunlear.

805
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:19,474
Are you okay?

806
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:22,210
Yes, yes, I just
needed a little pick-me-up.

807
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:23,611
It's been an exhausting day.

808
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,614
Facing one's mortality will do that.

809
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:29,384
I think we'll all
deserve a vacation after tonight,

810
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,352
a chance to mourn Tim properly.

811
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,187
I fly out tomorrow.

812
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:36,324
One of those Swiss med spas
that masquerades as a resort?

813
00:34:36,392 --> 00:34:37,592
No.

814
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,461
No, I own a small ranch
outside of Buenos Aires.

815
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:41,863
Lovely.

816
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,865
I knew some folks who moved to
Buenos Aires back in the day.

817
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,667
Oh. Good people?

818
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:49,404
Nazis. No extradition
treaty in Argentina.

819
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:53,274
Just a nasty bunch of
miscreants hiding in plain sight.

820
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,742
Gosh, they got away with murder.

821
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:03,184
You did kill your husband, didn't you?

822
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:05,019
No, that's absurd.

823
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:06,767
I have to admit, I'm
not entirely sure why,

824
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,289
but Detective Decker will figure it out.

825
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:09,290
She always does.

826
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,558
I loved him.

827
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:11,993
And Tim loved me.

828
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:13,828
Well, no, technically, he
loved your assistant, Kyle.

829
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:17,699
Yes, but I... I would never...

830
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,034
Tim was a good man.

831
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:21,369
He was selfless...

832
00:35:21,437 --> 00:35:23,371
Yes.

833
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,772
Yes, he was.

834
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,775
Everybody loved Tim, and he
asked for nothing in return,

835
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:30,278
not even his own happiness.

836
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:33,748
Well, as the old saying goes,
you can't keep a good man down,

837
00:35:33,816 --> 00:35:35,483
not even in death.

838
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:39,020
So how about we go downstairs,

839
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:41,756
see this night through, and then...

840
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:44,325
Oh, bloody hell.

841
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:53,100
Lucifer!

842
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:55,314
Where's Lucifer?

843
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:58,650
Lucifer Morningstar, where is he?

844
00:35:58,718 --> 00:35:59,718
Out of the way.

845
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:01,653
Hey!

846
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:16,435
You're alive.

847
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:20,439
Yes.

848
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:22,508
Yes, it would appear
that way, wouldn't it?

849
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:25,711
What are you doing here?

850
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:28,780
I came to stop Malcolm; he's
planning to shoot you.

851
00:36:28,848 --> 00:36:30,082
Malcolm?

852
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,084
No, no, this wasn't him.

853
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:33,919
He's taken care of.

854
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:36,355
He is?

855
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:37,823
How?

856
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:40,325
Well, I made him an
offer that he couldn't...

857
00:36:40,393 --> 00:36:42,294
You know the line.

858
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:44,296
You look terrible, by the way.

859
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:45,764
Rough day at the office?

860
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:47,666
Uh, yeah.

861
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:49,134
Yeah, you could say that.

862
00:36:49,202 --> 00:36:52,171
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a charity to attend

863
00:36:52,238 --> 00:36:54,072
and a killer to punish.

864
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:56,475
How do I look?

865
00:36:57,977 --> 00:36:59,678
Pretty good, actually.

866
00:36:59,746 --> 00:37:01,947
Yes, I thought as much.

867
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:05,918
Oh, have a drink.

868
00:37:05,985 --> 00:37:07,452
Two, if you like.

869
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,122
Who says the Devil can't be charitable?

870
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:14,927
Thank you all so
much for your generosity.

871
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:18,197
I would also like to
thank our host, Mr. Morningstar.

872
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:21,867
He was going to say a few
words, but unfortunately he's been...

873
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:23,702
Right on time.

874
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,438
How are we all this evening, eh?

875
00:37:26,506 --> 00:37:28,207
Such a well-preserved crowd.

876
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:30,242
Love your work, Dr. Broffman.

877
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,877
Tucking marvelous.

878
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:36,281
Right, we're all here to
honor Tim Dunlear's legacy,

879
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:40,219
and what better way to do
that than to reveal his killer?

880
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:44,156
Wouldn't you agree, Mrs. Dunlear?

881
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:47,159
Time to show your
friends your true colors.

882
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:50,229
Tell them all your nasty desires.

883
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:53,765
No need.

884
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,567
We already have everything,

885
00:37:55,635 --> 00:37:58,403
how she embezzled
money from the foundation,

886
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:01,173
and when Tim found out
about it, you killed him.

887
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:02,321
Ah, see?

888
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,495
Told you she'd figure it out.

889
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:05,611
You have no proof.

890
00:38:05,678 --> 00:38:06,745
Actually, we do.

891
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:08,280
We have
proof of the embezzlement,

892
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:10,115
and that's enough for probable cause.

893
00:38:10,183 --> 00:38:12,584
Vanessa...

894
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:16,421
I earned that money.

895
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:19,157
I supported him when he left pro ball.

896
00:38:19,225 --> 00:38:21,059
I let him sleep with my assistant.

897
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:22,794
- Oh.
- That money should go to me,

898
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:24,329
not those kids.

899
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:26,031
Tim was going to ruin everything.

900
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,300
I had to.

901
00:38:28,368 --> 00:38:31,270
Now, doesn't that feel better?

902
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:32,738
Huh?

903
00:38:32,805 --> 00:38:34,245
Vanessa Dunlear, you're under arrest

904
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:35,674
for the murder of Tim Dunlear.

905
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:39,978
Thank you.

906
00:38:40,046 --> 00:38:41,513
You're welcome.

907
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:49,921
There it is again, that rush.

908
00:38:59,365 --> 00:39:01,366
Looks like someone had a good night.

909
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:07,506
I know bed head when I see it.

910
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:12,911
We're talking again?

911
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:17,516
Well... life's too
short to hold grudges.

912
00:39:19,786 --> 00:39:22,454
Doesn't mean all is forgiven, mind.

913
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:24,923
I mean, you'd have to do something
pretty extraordinary

914
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:26,391
to wipe this slate clean.

915
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:36,535
I had sex with your brother.

916
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:45,344
And that puts you in my
good graces how exactly?

917
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:49,881
Well, I was his inside
woman, and now I'm yours.

918
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:55,654
Yes, well, I suppose that
could come in handy,

919
00:39:55,722 --> 00:39:58,123
especially since he
just tried to kill me.

920
00:39:58,191 --> 00:39:59,519
What?!

921
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,993
- Wait, you were shot?
- Mm-hmm.

922
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:03,261
And you didn't bleed?

923
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:05,263
He hired a gunman.

924
00:40:05,331 --> 00:40:06,798
I mean, I talked the chap out of it,

925
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:08,800
but then this demented socialite...

926
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:11,770
I mean, it's a long
story, but I survived,

927
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:15,140
which is more than can
be said for my Armani.

928
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:16,128
But I don't understand.

929
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:17,409
How could you still be alive?

930
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:19,745
Well, that is the question,
isn't it, Maze?

931
00:40:19,812 --> 00:40:23,648
Why is it that sometimes I'm immortal...

932
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:27,853
and other times I'm all too human.

933
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:36,795
Oh, that's interesting.

934
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:39,164
What?

935
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:41,900
I need to go and test a theory.

936
00:40:45,238 --> 00:40:47,606
Oh, and, um...

937
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:51,977
tread carefully, Maze.

938
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:15,600
May I come in?

939
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:17,869
Who? St. Lucifer or the Devil?

940
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:21,273
Yes, rest
assured, St. Lucifer's retired.

941
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,944
Really?

942
00:41:26,012 --> 00:41:28,613
'Cause I just got a text
from Kyle saying that someone gave

943
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:31,983
money to Emmett
Toussaint's scholarship fund,

944
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:34,186
enough for a full ride.

945
00:41:34,253 --> 00:41:36,321
An anonymous donor.

946
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:38,790
Well, good for Emmett.

947
00:41:38,858 --> 00:41:40,459
Glad it worked out.

948
00:41:40,526 --> 00:41:42,060
Mm-hmm.

949
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:43,328
- Listen, Detective, I...
- I want...

950
00:41:43,396 --> 00:41:44,529
- Oh.
- Sorry.

951
00:41:44,597 --> 00:41:45,831
No, you.

952
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:53,205
Um, I've been thinking a
lot about the other night,

953
00:41:53,272 --> 00:41:57,242
why I showed up drunk to your place,

954
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:01,813
why you wouldn't sleep with me,

955
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:04,349
and I think us,

956
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:07,352
our thing,

957
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,622
maybe it goes beyond just work.

958
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,891
- Or sex.
- What sex?

959
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:16,228
Congratulations, the first
woman to give the Devil blue balls.

960
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:18,964
Anyhow,

961
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:22,601
I, uh, I just...

962
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:29,641
I can let my guard down with you.

963
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,743
I don't do that with anyone else.

964
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:34,679
You make me vulnerable.

965
00:42:34,747 --> 00:42:38,917
And... maybe that's okay.

966
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:44,623
Detective...

967
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:50,862
if it's any consolation to your pride...

968
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,588
it appears you make me vulnerable, too.
