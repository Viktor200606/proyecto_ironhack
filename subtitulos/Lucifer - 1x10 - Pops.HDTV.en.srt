so we have to go
through anyone and everyone

183
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:14,176
that could have had their hands

184
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:15,444
on Javier's last meal.

185
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:17,446
That's chefs, servers, bussers.

186
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:19,314
Even the dishwasher could have done it.

187
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:21,316
Oh, so many people,

188
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:23,952
so many reasons to kill Pops.

190
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:38,791
WOMAN: I loved him.

191
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:40,827
Pops was like a father to me.

192
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:42,295
He was such a nice man.

193
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,030
Except when you made a mistake.

194
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:45,365
WOMAN 2: That's right.

195
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:48,034
Then he got upset, and he threw things.

196
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:51,270
He threw things... a lot.

197
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:53,473
- Where were you this morning?
- Here.

198
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,141
I'm always here.

199
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:56,609
Pops worked me to the bone.

200
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,111
A taskmaster, was he?

201
00:06:58,178 --> 00:07:00,646
No matter what you gave
him, it wasn't enough?

202
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:02,181
It wasn't.

203
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:03,649
And I gave him a lot.

204
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:09,889
Ah, to the bone, indeed.

205
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:11,657
Did you have any altercations with Pops?

206
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,493
- Sure.
- All the time.

207
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,029
Nothing I did was ever
good enough for Pops.

208
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,730
And it never would be, would it?

209
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:20,600
Which is why he left you
with no choice but to take matters

210
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,201
into your own hands.

211
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:23,870
He was like a father to me.

212
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:25,705
He was like a father to me...

213
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:27,407
He was like a father to me.

214
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:31,477
And how was he to everyone else?

215
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:34,847
Tough, but, ultimately, he was fair.

216
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:36,816
Uh, he cared about his people.

217
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:37,950
He was...

218
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:38,985
"Like a father to you."

219
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:40,753
Yes, we've heard that one before.

220
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,655
He was my father.

221
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:45,691
This is Javier's son, Junior.

222
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,360
I don't work here anymore.

223
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,629
I-I've been away a while.

224
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:52,331
I came over as soon as I got the call.

225
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,133
(chuckles)

226
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,102
I still can't believe he's gone, man.

227
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,171
Wayward son, are you?

228
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:00,206
Yeah, you could say that.

229
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:02,642
You and your father had
a strained relationship?

230
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:05,945
It's... it's complicated.

231
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:08,481
You know, I feel like the only thing

232
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:10,483
that made him happy was this place.

233
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:13,886
So let me guess, you tried
to follow in his footsteps?

234
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:15,354
Yeah, I trained as a chef, yeah.

235
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:18,391
And Dad was domineering, acted
like a god in the kitchen?

236
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:19,659
Lucifer.

237
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:21,527
You have no idea.

238
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:23,162
Oh, you'd be surprised.

239
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,364
I was never gonna live
up to him, so I just, I...

240
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:27,300
Rejected everything he stood for.

241
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,367
Yeah.

242
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:31,504
I gave up cooking, I hit the road...

243
00:08:31,572 --> 00:08:33,731
Which is why I'm
curious about your return.

244
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:37,276
Was there something that you wanted
to do when you came back?

245
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:39,979
Uh, I don't know, like...

246
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:41,280
Oh, come now.

247
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:44,250
The prodigal son returns
to his overbearing father.

248
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:47,120
What could you possibly desire?

249
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:51,190
I wanted...

250
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:52,391
Yes?

251
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:56,662
To have one more meal with my dad.

252
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,365
(Chloe clears throat)

253
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,103
(sighs) So you just
got into town last night?

254
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,472
Yeah, I-I met Dad here for breakfast.

255
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,175
Did you notice anything
strange about him or the meal?

256
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:10,810
Anything?

257
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:12,612
Dad had them bring out our usual.

258
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,114
(chuckles) We were
actually getting along for once.

259
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:17,016
Uh, after we finished eating,

260
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:19,085
Dad left to do his pickup at the market.

261
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:20,793
We were supposed to meet
up later tonight.

262
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:22,814
Said he had something he
wanted to tell me, but...

263
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:24,357
So now that Dad's gone,

264
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,225
I'm guessing the restaurant goes to you?

265
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:28,895
No, I don't... I don't
deserve this place.

266
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:31,531
Dad knew that.

267
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,099
(chuckles)

268
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,133
Well, stay in town.

269
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,601
We may have more questions for you.

270
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:39,438
LUCIFER: Well.

271
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:41,607
Isn't that a coincidence?

272
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:42,909
Boy returns home,

273
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:46,012
and, conveniently, his
pops drops the next day?

274
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,414
(sighs) Lucky bastard.

275
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:50,516
Maybe.

276
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,818
Or maybe this is about something
more than anger,

277
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,320
which they all had,

278
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:57,657
but if Junior isn't
inheriting the restaurant, then who is?

279
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,329
<i>LINDA: Well, I'm glad you
decided to come here,</i>

280
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:07,533
but I'm not sure this is appropriate.

281
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:08,868
Why?

282
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:12,004
Well, Lucifer's your
boss and a client of mine.

283
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,373
I can recommend you to someone else.

284
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,576
No, I like you.

285
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:18,744
Look, you helped Lucifer,
and I need you to help me.

286
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:20,713
(sighs)

287
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,381
What seems to be the problem?

288
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:25,318
(sighs)

289
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:27,587
I'm stuck in a place I don't belong,

290
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:29,889
and I'm not going anywhere anytime soon.

291
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:32,124
I need to figure out

292
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:33,326
how to be more...

293
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:36,796
normal.

294
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:38,764
So...

295
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:40,566
"So" what?

296
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:43,069
Tell me what to do.

297
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:45,504
Well, that's not how this works.

298
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:49,242
Do I need to sleep with you too?

299
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:50,576
What?

300
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,478
Is that it?

301
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:53,613
Uh, no.

302
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
No, I'm good.

303
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:55,615
I'm good.

304
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:57,683
Really, I'm good.

305
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:01,387
What I can give you...

306
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:04,590
is my advice.

307
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:07,293
So... if we want to feel
more connected to our environment,

308
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:08,694
sometimes it's helpful

309
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:12,098
if we actively embrace
it and those around you.

310
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:14,133
That still sounds like sex.

311
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:17,503
Okay. I meant, uh, engage in

312
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:21,307
caring and meaningful relationships.

313
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,542
Making friends.

314
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,677
Forget it.

315
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:25,811
This was a mistake.

316
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,846
Mazikeen.

317
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:28,014
Wait. If you could...

318
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,051
What just happened?

319
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:34,487
♪ ♪

320
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:37,523
Something on your mind, partner?

321
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:40,379
What's the gun for, Malcolm?

322
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:43,429
Oh, you mean that gun you stole for me?

323
00:11:43,497 --> 00:11:44,964
That gun?

324
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:46,299
I was wondering when you'd ask.

325
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:47,333
You know what?

326
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,068
I'm done playing your stupid games.

327
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:50,970
You want to tell everyone I shot you,

328
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:52,772
you go right ahead.

329
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,174
But I'm gonna put an end to
whatever you're planning.

330
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:56,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

331
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:57,910
Hey, chill, Dan.

332
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:01,013
God, you went from zero to 100 so fast.

333
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,248
The way I see it,

334
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:03,983
I'm doing you a favor.

335
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,757
(chuckles) A favor?

336
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:07,887
Another man spends so
much time with my wife,

337
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,722
I sure wouldn't like it.

338
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,525
Especially knowing this
guy's so dangerous.

339
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:16,095
You want to kill Lucifer?

340
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:17,763
Why?

341
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,498
If I told you,

342
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:20,933
I promise,

343
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,535
you wouldn't believe me.

344
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,471
But before you go

345
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:28,674
growing any more balls, remember this...

346
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:29,787
(sighs)

347
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,477
You thinking about taking
another shot at me,

348
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:33,479
try to take me down?

349
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:37,550
Don't miss.

350
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:43,189
So you're Anne Martin, the sous chef.

351
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:44,336
You're Javier's number two?

352
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:45,691
ANNE: I mean, I guess I was.

353
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,361
I mean, I-I can't believe it.

354
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:50,262
I... I just saw Pops this morning.

355
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,464
He was fine.

356
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:53,251
And you cooked his last
meal, is that right?

357
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,600
So?

358
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:56,828
You know how many people
had their hands on that plate?

359
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,404
Well, this is your kitchen, Anne.

360
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:00,032
When Pops isn't here, you run the show.

361
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,173
And from what I understand,

362
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,259
you're not someone to
be messed with, so...

363
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:05,378
you really think
someone's gonna go behind your back?

364
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:06,979
I can't control what they do.

365
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,781
Who knows what kind of psychos we have?

366
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,049
Well, are any of these psychos

367
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,770
set to inherit the
restaurant, like you are?

368
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:13,953
I spoke to his estate attorney.

369
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,989
It's no secret Javier was
grooming me to take over.

370
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:18,524
He was my mentor.

371
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,326
Well, of all the reasons to
kill your father figure,

372
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:22,027
greed is truly the ugliest.

373
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:24,497
You think I killed Pops to
speed up my inheritance?

374
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:26,832
I would never do anything to hurt him.

375
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,967
He taught me everything.

376
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,101
He meant the world
to me. (phone buzzing)

377
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:32,204
LUCIFER: Well...

378
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:33,992
If you didn't wish your
dear old "Pops" ill,

379
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:36,509
what did you wish?

380
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:38,844
To surpass him.

381
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:40,212
Ah! So the student

382
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,814
becomes the master, eh?

383
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:43,249
What? No! It's not like that.

384
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:44,583
CHLOE: Preliminary tox screen came in.

385
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:47,253
The poison used to
kill Javier was mercury.

386
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,354
Oh.

387
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:49,655
So you cracked open a few thermometers

388
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:50,923
over brunch, did you?

389
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:53,025
Not the trick I'd
use, but clearly effective.

390
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,161
There was something
else in his system, too.

391
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:56,548
Can I see the inside of your arms?

392
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:57,596
Why?

393
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:58,631
Track marks.

394
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:00,266
Ah, so there was heroin as well?

395
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,001
Generous killer, aren't you?

396
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:04,003
Wanted to give him a
little high on the way out?

397
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,471
This is crazy. No. If you...

398
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,873
if it's heroin, you should talk to...

399
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:09,608
I'm sorry.

400
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:10,843
Don't worry.

401
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:12,745
I tend to have a rather
striking effect on women.

402
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:13,913
Come on.

403
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,781
Just let it all out.

404
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:17,183
Oh!

405
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,919
Okay.

406
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,353
Someone call an ambulance!

407
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,509
Well, I've never had that effect.

408
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:36,110
Do you still think she's a suspect?

409
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:37,658
We can arrest her now, if you'd like.

410
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:40,047
You know, once she's done
getting her stomach pumped.

411
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:41,716
What I want to know is...

412
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,783
did she ingest the same
thing as Javier by mistake?

413
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:46,887
Or was she poisoned, too?

414
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,189
Why did she survive?

415
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:50,825
Well, perhaps the killer
simply ran out of thermometers.

416
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:52,226
Who would have a bone to pick

417
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:53,794
with Javier and his number two?

418
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:55,096
Oh, I don't know.

419
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:56,697
Perhaps someone who was kicked
out of the family biz?

420
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,065
You mean Junior.

421
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,234
Well, he seemed like a
very troubled young man to me.

422
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:01,369
Yeah.

423
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:03,304
It's almost as if his dad just died.

424
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,906
Oh, and look who decided to
grace us with his douchedom.

425
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:08,009
Daniel...

426
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:10,277
Hey. Did you find something?

427
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:11,712
A Naomi Austen.

428
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,281
She worked as a hostess here
last year till she was fired.

429
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:16,117
She has two arrests
for heroin possession

430
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:17,351
over the last year alone.

431
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,820
Poor girl doesn't
learn her lesson, does she?

432
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:20,855
Naomi Austen.

433
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:22,323
That name sounds familiar.

434
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:23,991
Oh, okay.

435
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,560
So one of the cooks said
that she showed up two days ago,

436
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:28,429
and was yelling at
Javier and Anne, so...

437
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:30,464
I'll see if her P.O. has an address.

438
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,199
It's already in the file.

439
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:33,827
Look at you two, like Cagney and Lacey.

440
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:36,404
You don't care who you piss off, do you?

441
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:37,538
Not in the slightest, no.

442
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,206
(under breath) Oh, my God.

443
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:40,241
Oh, wait!

444
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:41,909
Um, Dan. Um...

445
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:45,646
So, uh, if you don't have plans tonight,

446
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,783
my mom is having this family dinner...

447
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,951
And you could really use a buffer.

448
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,386
Yeah.

449
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,321
Sure. Send me the details.

450
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,489
All right.

451
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:57,224
LUCIFER: Detective...

452
00:15:57,292 --> 00:15:59,060
do you mind if we
make a stop on the way?

453
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:01,462
I mean, this shirt's more
of a loaner, really.

454
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:04,932
(buzzing)

455
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,672
(Chloe sighs)

456
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,474
Still no answer.

457
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:19,246
OJ... spoons, foil.

458
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:20,614
Looks like a junkie...

459
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,788
What do you think you're doing?

460
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:30,124
Well, I found
something far more interesting.

461
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:31,292
We don't have a warrant.

462
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,860
We don't have time for
warrants, Detective!

463
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:35,129
Look. Junior was here.

464
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:36,263
Junior was staying here?

465
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:38,799
He and Naomi must be close.

466
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,334
Yeah, well, they probably
chased the dragon together

467
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:41,602
after Junior killed his dad

468
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,871
and then sat and
looked at the twinkly lights.

469
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,819
Why have they still got
their Christmas tree up?

470
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,108
We don't know what happened.

471
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:49,009
Well, maybe something in
here will help clear that up.

472
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:51,612
Right. Uh...

473
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,949
Board shorts.

474
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:56,984
Don't know what more proof
you need that he's deranged.

475
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:59,053
We're not supposed to be in here.

476
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,588
Oh, come on.

477
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:01,856
(sighs)

478
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:04,358
So let's just search the place fast.

479
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:06,060
Oh! Well, well.

480
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:07,862
Lead the way, Detective.

481
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,463
All right.

482
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,034
(couple moaning in
pleasure, bed springs squeaking)

483
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:15,469
Oh... I... can...

484
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:16,637
can you hear that?

485
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:19,073
Yeah. And since when
has that bothered you?

486
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:20,441
WOMAN: Oh, God!

487
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:22,042
And dear old Dad strikes again.

488
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,911
- I mean...
- (giggles)

489
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,579
- It's not funny.
- It's kind of funny.

490
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:26,967
Well, that's easy for you to say.

491
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,516
You're not the one being
taunted, are you?

492
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,684
"Oh, God" this! "Oh, God" that!

493
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:33,420
He's popping up everywhere and
spoiling my favorite things!

494
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:35,589
I'd really hate to be in your head.

495
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:36,757
Well, why would you understand?

496
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:38,759
Your mother's absolutely delightful.

497
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:40,628
<i>Oh, of course you think she is.</i>

498
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:41,428
Oh...

499
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:43,364
Do I detect some angst?

500
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,802
She's like a child.

501
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:49,570
- Oh, and I bet it drove you crazy.
- Yeah.

502
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:52,339
All she wanted was to doll me
up and take me to auditions.

503
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:54,141
Would make anyone mad with rage.

504
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:55,609
She made everything about her.

505
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:58,579
So you could just murder her!

506
00:17:58,647 --> 00:17:59,713
Sure.

507
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:01,048
But I didn't.

508
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:03,083
And you're still not
proving your point about Junior.

509
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,718
(sighs)

510
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:05,686
Fair enough.

511
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,822
So how did you handle it, anyway?

512
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:09,790
You know, besides taking your
anger out on criminals?

513
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:11,158
I don't know.

514
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:14,195
I guess I just always tried to

515
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:17,598
focus on something else.

516
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,866
This is...

517
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:20,334
weird.

518
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:29,643
Well! That painting

519
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,612
just became far more valuable.

520
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
- (door opens)
- Oh.

521
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:35,916
Hello, Naomi.

522
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,084
Who the hell are you?

523
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:38,085
Heroin inspector.

524
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:39,320
I'm afraid your spoons

525
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:41,088
aren't up to standard, so...

526
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:42,423
Hold on.

527
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,024
We have some questions for you.

528
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:47,728
<i>NAOMI: You think I killed Javier?</i>

529
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:49,697
Well, I don't. But she definitely does.

530
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:51,332
But she thought it
was the sous chef before,

531
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:52,519
so don't take it personally.

532
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:53,834
(Chloe clears throat)

533
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:57,771
The poison that killed
Javier was laced with heroin.

534
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,807
We know you use and we
know that you had a fight

535
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,810
with Javier and Anne
Martin two days ago.

536
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:03,777
Okay, I admit,

537
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:05,779
I went to see Pops a few days ago,

538
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:07,381
'cause Junior called me to tell me

539
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,316
he was coming back home.

540
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:11,919
I just wanted to make
peace with his dad.

541
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:13,053
Make peace? Why?

542
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:14,820
Because he didn't want us together.

543
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,550
- So you're dating Junior.
- We were.

544
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:18,726
A year ago, before he left.

545
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:22,897
And I thought,
maybe, when he came back...

546
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:24,498
But Pops never approved.

547
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:26,400
Well, I can't see why they're not fans

548
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:28,669
of your whole Kurt and Courtney vibe.

549
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:31,005
I tried to tell him that
Junior got clean on his travels,

550
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,840
but it didn't matter.

551
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:35,109
Javier said he would never support us.

552
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,377
I got upset.

553
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:37,884
What happened with you at breakfast?

554
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:40,014
Nothing.

555
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,415
I wasn't even at breakfast.

556
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:43,617
Junior wanted to see his dad alone.

557
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:45,052
I went to see my sponsor.

558
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,054
I've been having a
tough time of it lately.

559
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:48,555
All right.

560
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:49,690
Until we can confirm that,

561
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:51,358
we need you to come down to the station.

562
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:52,826
Why, pray tell,

563
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:54,895
did Junior want to see his dad alone?

564
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:57,064
He just said that he
wanted to make it right.

565
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,632
That all he needed to do

566
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,335
was confront his
father and settle things.

567
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:03,504
- (laughs)
- Hmm.

568
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,239
You don't think that...

569
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:06,640
He killed him?

570
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,476
Junior told us he wanted to
have one more meal with his dad.

571
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:10,945
It seems he did...

572
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:12,579
a rather final one.

573
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:15,416
Do you know where he is?

574
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:18,585
I haven't talked to
him since this morning.

575
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,491
CHLOE: APB on Junior's out.

576
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,960
We're trying to ping his cell.

577
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:28,095
I'm glad we're finally on the same page.

578
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:29,697
You know, ever since we met this kid,

579
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,365
you've had it in for him. Why?

580
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,834
Guess he's a bird of a feather.

581
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:36,704
Someone who had a shadow cast
over him his entire life.

582
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:38,238
Whereas I could never
escape from under mine...

583
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:39,974
he could.

584
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,042
I wonder how that feels.

585
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,043
(phone rings)

586
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,812
Decker.

587
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:48,115
No. No, you did the right thing.

588
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,016
I'm on my way.

589
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:50,184
Did they find Junior?

590
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,151
No. I gotta go.

591
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:52,252
But we've a killer to catch!

592
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,887
And we will. This is an emergency.

593
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,557
(knocking) Detective!

594
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:58,058
Come on!

595
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,026
Oh...

596
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:01,562
(tires squealing)

597
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:04,665
You've got to stop doing that!

598
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:07,701
(sighs)

599
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:08,836
Oh, no.

600
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:11,672
Nana says we're gonna be in a movie!

601
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,906
(scoffs)

602
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:14,675
PENELOPE: No, no, no.

603
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:18,379
So the babysitter called

604
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:20,547
and said that you let her off early.

605
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,215
Yeah, 'cause we didn't need her anymore.

606
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:24,218
We were just on our way

607
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:25,986
to our first audition.

608
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:27,121
Ooh, isn't that a thrill?

609
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:28,422
You didn't think to ask me about that?

610
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,491
What do you mean, "our" audition?

611
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:32,159
I am up for a new role,

612
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:33,427
and I thought it would be good

613
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:34,995
to play off of somebody.

614
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:36,196
Oh, okay.

615
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,399
Can I talk to you for a sec?

616
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:39,786
So you thought it'd be a good idea

617
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,668
to use Trixie as a prop?

618
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:42,736
A co-star.

619
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:44,271
Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

620
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:47,007
And isn't she the cutest
little lounge singer you've ever seen?

621
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,442
She looks ridiculous.

622
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,878
How can you exploit your
family for your next acting job?

623
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:52,465
You know, for someone who hated acting,

624
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,148
you sure know how to be dramatic.

625
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,182
You can't do this.

626
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,550
You can't push Trixie into this

627
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,152
the way that you pushed me.

628
00:21:58,219 --> 00:21:59,853
You can't walk in here...

629
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:01,688
Like I own the place?

630
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:03,057
The place you're living in

631
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:05,292
rent free?

632
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,593
You asked me to stay here.

633
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,962
You have no right to take her...

634
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:12,433
Where is she?

635
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:14,301
She was just here.

636
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:15,669
Trixie?

637
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:17,771
Trix?

638
00:22:19,174 --> 00:22:21,308
Trixie?

639
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:22,910
Trixie!

640
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:25,533
She's gone.

641
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,057
I've called her friends,
I've called our neighbors.

642
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,959
No one has heard from her. No.

643
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:38,863
All right, I'll call
you if I hear anything.

644
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,464
Dan hasn't heard from her.

645
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:41,666
Take a breath, Chloe.

646
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:43,467
She's a smart
girl... where would she go?

647
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:44,969
I don't know.

648
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:47,171
- She left and...
- (phone chimes)

649
00:22:48,874 --> 00:22:49,840
What?

650
00:22:49,908 --> 00:22:51,275
What is it?

651
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:54,979
She ordered a ride from my Uber account.

652
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:56,781

716

00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,021
came for this.

00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:55,693
Careful, Junior, you
don't who you're playing with.

726
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,660
What?

727
00:25:56,728 --> 00:25:57,862
No.

728
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:00,064
(sighs)

729
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:02,433
My dad gave me this knife.

730
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,501
It's all I have left from him.

731
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:08,672
You're not relieved he's gone at all.

732
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,574
Why would I be relieved?

733
00:26:10,642 --> 00:26:12,082
Because he was judgmental and cruel,

734
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:14,245
and he tried to force you into
being someone you're not.

735
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:16,013
And he's gone now.

736
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,982
So you can finally be your own man.

737
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:19,583
Oh, dear.

738
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:21,785
You didn't kill him, did you?

739
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:23,787
Of course not.

740
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:25,723
(sighs)

741
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,525
So, are you gonna arrest me or what?

742
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,133
Hi, Trixie!

743
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:38,202
I'm so glad you're back.

744
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,910
Listen, Nana needs to
explain something...

745
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:42,172
- Mom, let's just have dinner, okay?
- (knocks)

746
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,074
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Dan!

747
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:46,243
What a pleasant surprise.

748
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:49,013
- And you brought dessert.
- Of course.

749
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,315
So thoughtful as always.

750
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:52,917
So good to see you, Penny.

751
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:54,218
Something smells amazing.

752
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:55,653
- Mmm.
- Yeah, Mom.

753
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,421
Where'd you buy this
nice home-cooked meal?

754
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:59,523
Oh, there's no take-out tonight.

755
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:00,824
Lucifer

756
00:27:00,892 --> 00:27:02,626
has provided the meal.

757
00:27:02,694 --> 00:27:03,928
Wait.

758
00:27:03,995 --> 00:27:05,296
Lucifer's here?

759
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:07,398
He and his friend have
been here a while.

760
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:08,465
- His friend?
- LUCIFER: Ah!

761
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:10,935
Detective! Just in time.

762
00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:12,670
Uh, you remember Junior?

763
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:13,604
Of course.

764
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:16,206
Just wait until you taste his molé.

765
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:18,409
It is to die for.

766
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:26,379
- Lucifer!
- LUCIFER: Oh, get back!

767
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,780
Okay, monkey, surprise.

768
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:30,415
You get to eat
chocolate cake in bed tonight.

769
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,017
Why?

770
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:33,251
Does it matter?

771
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,253
Nope.

772
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,155
Junior, if you wouldn't mind.

773
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:39,624
(clears throat)

774
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,626
- Yes?
- So you brought

775
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:44,596
a guy who's suspected
of murder by poisoning

776
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,232
to cook for my family?

777
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,400
Well, if you arrest him,

778
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:49,768
he's just going to lawyer up, isn't he?

779
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,770
So why not have a nice meal

780
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,271
whilst you get all the
answers you need, hmm?

781
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,806
I'm certain he'll open up.

782
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,007
Why is that?

783
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,242
Because I convinced
him you'd hear him out.

784
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,543
After all, he's innocent.

785
00:27:58,611 --> 00:27:59,911
Oh, you think he's innocent now?

786
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,079
Come on, Detective.

787
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,781
If you're not
satisfied with his answers,

788
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,149
you can always arrest him afterwards.

789
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:05,337
JUNIOR: I stopped eating meat

790
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,220
while backpacking through India,

791
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:11,590
so I had to get creative with my dishes.

792
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:14,392
This is my vegetarian take

793
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,295
on Oaxacan molé with a tart,

794
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,663
vegan crème fraîche.

795
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:21,199
- Sounds so exotic.
- Lovely.

796
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,434
I cannot wait to dig in.

797
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:24,870
- Mom, don't eat that!
- Why not?

798
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,337
She's worried it might be poisoned.

799
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:28,140
- You are?
- Oh, that's right.

800
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,408
Let's catch you up,
shall we? Um, I brought

801
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:31,610
Junior here tonight

802
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:32,711
because Detective Decker believes

803
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:33,745
that he killed his father.

804
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,647
- You do?
- What are you doing, man?

805
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,835
But I believe he was after
something far more foolish.

806
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,717
Reconciliation.

807
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,385
JUNIOR: That's right.

808
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:41,820
I didn't kill my dad.

809
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:42,821
Do you have proof?

810
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,557
Just my word.

811
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,385
Well, we might need something
more than that.

812
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,827
Oh, come on,
Detective, you said yourself

813
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,795
you may want to kill your mother,
but you don't do it.

814
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,864
Oh, so you want to kill me
now? Just because I put makeup

815
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,559
- on your daughter?
- No, because she thinks

816
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:56,091
thinks you're a child and forced her

817
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,003
to grow up too quickly.

818
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:00,438
Am I wrong?

819
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:01,806
You're way out line, man.

820
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:04,476
There he goes
leaping to her defense again.

821
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:05,677
You know, perhaps you two are closer

822
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,179
to getting back together than I thought.

823
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,646
- You are?
- No, we haven't decided.

824
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,148
Things are moving that way.

825
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,117
We just had the one kiss.

826
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,065
So you're kissing now?

827
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,386
Right.

828
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,453
Maybe that explains why
you won't have sex with me.

829
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:17,689
I'm sorry, what?

830
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,024
No.

831
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,292
You're juggling

832
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,694
both these handsome gentlemen?

833
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:25,630
I'm not juggling anything.

834
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:26,932
Well, trust me, honey,

835
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,166
you better do mething,

836
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,501
'cause you're not getting any younger.

837
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:31,529
However, what do I know?
Because I'm just a child.

838
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:34,072
If you don't like it, why
don't you stop acting like one?

839
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,309
(laughing)

840
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:40,545
You guys sound just like me and my dad.

841
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,916
We used to fight all the
time over the dumbest stuff.

842
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,885
That's why I left.

843
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:50,655
But no matter what I
did, I couldn't get away.

844
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:52,857
You know, 'cause every time

845
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:55,493
I cooked a meal or I
looked in the mirror,

846
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:59,297
there he was staring back at me.

847
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:00,565
That's a tad bit creepy.

848
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,435
Because he's a part of me, man.

849
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,270
You know, he may have pushed too hard,

850
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:07,906
and-and-and tried to make
me something that I'm not,

851
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:12,577
but in the end, it made me the man I am.

852
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,913
And I'm proud of who I've become.

853
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,982
Yeah, I came back home

854
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,285
so I could tell him that I was clean.

855
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,787
And I want to be a chef again.

856
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:24,489
And this meal?

857
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:27,058
Was what I was gonna
make for him to prove it.

858
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,893
Well, it looks

859
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:31,630
very good.

860
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,834
I didn't kill my dad.

861
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,838
All right, so either arrest
me or let me go.

862
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:43,475
Well, we are gonna need
you to come downtown,

863
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:44,509
and make a statement.

864
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:46,144
DAN: Please.

865
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:48,713
Let me... I'm happy to
have an excuse to leave.

866
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:49,848
Dan...

867
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,716
Don't go.

868
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:55,854
I wanted one reason to stick up for you.

869
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:59,758
Just one. Let's go, pal.

870
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,663
Well...

871
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,265
I have suddenly lost my appetite.

872
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,100
(sighs)

873
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:11,536
Absolutely.

874
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,171
I hope you're happy.

875
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,174
No, actually, I'm
extremely disappointed.

876
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,562
- Because you ruined dinner?
- No.

877
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,412
Because Junior's answer was
spectacularly unhelpful.

878
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,546
He didn't escape

879
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:23,094
his father because he turned into him.

880
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,717
I mean, that doesn't apply to me at all!

881
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,526
(sighs)

882
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:41,766
(clears throat)

883
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,068
So I cleaned up.

884
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:44,736
The food, I mean.

885
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:46,538
It wasn't quite the
same as Chef Javier's.

886
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,240
But I have to admit,
the boy can cook, so...

887
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:52,877
I see you're still working the case.

888
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,379
You were right.

889
00:31:54,447 --> 00:31:55,847
Junior's innocent.

890
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:58,483
Well, glad you
learned something at dinner.

891
00:31:58,551 --> 00:31:59,551
No, the lab called.

892
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,119
The heroin that we found at Naomi's

893
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:03,355
doesn't match the
kind that killed Javier.

894
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,023
So if Junior didn't kill his dad,

895
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,459
why use heroin?

896
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,828
To frame him, maybe?

897
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:10,695
Yeah.

898
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:11,996
I thought about that, too.

899
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,232
But the only person with
motive got poisoned herself.

900
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,468
Unless she knew exactly
how much to give herself.

901
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,137
Creating all the gruesome symptoms,

902
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:22,240
but without the finale, yeah...

903
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,609
But the restaurant was hers,

904
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,611
so why would she do it?

905
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,981
I don't know, maybe
Pops had a change of heart.

906
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,083
Decided to bring
Junior back into the fold

907
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,886
after he found out he'd
changed and was coming home?

908
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:43,935
Yeah, this is Detective Decker.

909
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,865
I'm calling about a
patient, Anne Martin.

910
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:47,966
Yeah.

911
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,002
An hour ago?

912
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,004
Yeah, thanks.

913
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,941
Guess who checked out against orders.

914
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:00,145
Well, I wonder where
our lovely sous-chef's

915
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,880
headed in such a hurry.

916
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,915
(chuckles)

917
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,258
LUCIFER: Bravo.

918
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,565
That's a brilliant hiding place.

919
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,294
No wonder the police couldn't
find it earlier.

920
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:17,629
What are you doing here?

921
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:18,963
Well, we'd ask you the same question,

922
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,365
but we already know you're
destroying evidence.

923
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:21,766
Because you killed Javier.

924
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,369
I told you, I would never
do anything to hurt Javier.

925
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,638
You seem genuinely upset.

926
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,640
Like you didn't want Javier to die.

927
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,176
You humans are quite the
paradox, aren't you?

928
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,977
You're always
killing your loved ones and...

929
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:35,046
Unless the poison wasn't meant for him.

930
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:37,916
You meant to kill Junior, didn't you?

931
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,184
What?

932
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,452
Oh.

933
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,120
Hence the drugs.

934
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,755
He'd die a grisly death,

935
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:45,957
and we'd assume he simply got a bad fix.

936
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,425
Oh, that is very clever.

937
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:48,526
Except you didn't realize

938
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:49,494
that Junior changed while he was away.

939
00:33:49,562 --> 00:33:50,662
He stopped eating meat.

940
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,231
LUCIFER: Which is why his
father ate his food,

941
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,200
and you killed the man you love.

942
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,635
Ooh, a cruel twist of fate.

943
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,437
You don't know what
you're talking about.

944
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:00,672
So when we test
that powder in your hand,

945
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:01,673
you're telling me it's not gonna match

946
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,941
the poison that killed Javier?

947
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:06,377
That ungrateful kid did
not deserve this place.

948
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:09,414
He was given everything,
and he threw it all away.

949
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:12,217
But it didn't matter.

950
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,953
'Cause he was still the favorite.

951
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,956
Because he was
worthy of his father's love.

952
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,525
And he had a chance at redemption
until you ruined it.

953
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,137
Are you okay?

954
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,673
This place can't possibly be up to code.

955
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,042
We've got to get out of here.

956
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,910
Damn it, there's nowhere to go.

957
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,948
Oh, no, no, no, no, this
is not how it goes down,

958
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,051
not by a long shot, Dad.

959
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,286
Lucifer, if you have any ideas...

960
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,022
now's the time.

961
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,831
CHLOE: You can put me down.

962
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,266
LUCIFER: Right.

963
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,667
Happy now?

964
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,207
(Lucifer scoffs)

965
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,209
The Devil gets burned by fire.

966
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,977
Could this be any more ironic?

967
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,746
- (chuckles)
- Ah.

968
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,848
Does my pain amuse you, Detective?

969
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,383
A little bit.

970
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,984
And so does this.

971
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,987
(laughs)

972
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,989
You little rascal.

973
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,493
(indistinct radio transmission)

974
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,431
LUCIFER: Nice and tight.

975
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,366
Ah. Oh, thank you.

976
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,237
Anne was arrested a few blocks away,

977
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,741
so she'll be eating prison
slop for a long time to come.

978
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,943
Ah, her own personal hell indeed.

979
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:52,616
Thank you. For getting me out.

980
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,852
Well, couldn't exactly
rush out of there alone.

981
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,320
How would that look? (chuckles)

982
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,822
That's it?

983
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,192
No "thanks for saving me first"?

984
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,629
Is that what happened?

985
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,598
It's funny, it's all so fuzzy now.

986
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,800
Must be the third-degree burns.

987
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,535
(chuckles)

988
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,872
Can't believe it's gone.

989
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:18,509
We found out what your
dad never got to tell you.

990
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,412
He was gonna leave you the
restaurant all along.

991
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,515
If you even want it.

992
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,785
I think I do.

993
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,988
And maybe I could rebuild it.

994
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,556
You know, make it my own.

995
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,493
(knocking at door)

996
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,796
Uh, hang on, just a second.

997
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,197
Maze.

998
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:43,433
I'm surprised you came back.

999
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,434
I made a friend today.

1000
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,171
That's fantastic news.

1001
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,438
Who?

1002
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:51,108
An eight-year-old girl who
wandered into the bar.

1003
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:53,844
Well...

1004
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,913
That's a start.

1005
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,182
Perhaps the next one can
be of legal drinking age.

1006
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:01,885
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

1007
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,487
Yeah.

1008
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,590
So are you... busy tonight?

1009
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,328
♪ Now I don't even know ♪

1010
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,431
♪ Oh, I don't even know... ♪

1011
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,500
What happened to you?

1012
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,036
Oh, it's, uh...

1013
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,939
it's been kind of a rough night.

1014
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,708
So I could use a drink.

1015
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:25,976
Here.

1016
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,254
What are you... what are you doing up?

1017
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,489
I have an early flight.

1018
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,992
And I didn't want to
leave without saying good-bye.

1019
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,295
But you just got home.

1020
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,332
Look, I know

1021
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,335
I haven't always been the easiest mom.

1022
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,805
I could be pushy.

1023
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,940
Overbearing.

1024
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,609
I am sorry

1025
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,845
that you felt that you always
had to be the adult.

1026
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:07,050
All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

1027
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,919
I know.

1028
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:13,957
And sometimes I think you
could just take a leap.

1029
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:16,860
Hmm.

1030
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,396
(chuckles)

1031
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,964
Good night, pumpkin.

1032
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,633

It's awfully late to
be calling a meet, huh?

1039
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,427
You were right.

1040
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,430
Lucifer Morningstar is
insane and dangerous.

1041
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,332
And he deserves everything he gets.

1042
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,334
Well, that works out perfectly.

1043
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,336
(chuckles)

1044
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,876
But I can't let you kill him.

1045
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,047
Come on, man.

1046
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,182
I mean, we talked about this.

1047
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,919
You know, I go down, you go down.

1048
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:17,387
Then I go down.

1049
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,289
It's too bad.

1050
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,858
(handcuffs clicking) I mean,

1051
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:25,028
I thought we had
something really special going.

1052
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,767
Go to hell. Come on.

This is unexpected.

1067
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,917
You said the door's always open,

1068
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,253
and I'm walking through it.

1069
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,721
Mmm.

1070
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,157
Right, well, I was just on my
way out to meet the Brittanys,

1071
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,827
but... I suppose
they can occupy each other.

1072
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,129
Great.

1073
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,531
Then have a seat.

1074
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,332
Yes. Has something happened...

1075
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,736
I'm guessing by the
looks of it... with Dan perhaps?

1076
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,503
Mmm.

1077
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,272
You mean Detective Douche?

1078
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:18,083
(laughs) Yes, well, of
course that's what I mean,

1079
00:41:18,197 --> 00:41:19,953
but the bigger question
here is: why do you mean that?

1080
00:41:19,954 --> 00:41:21,645
We weren't even back together,

1081
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,114
and he ended it with me tonight.

1082
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,649
With a text.

1083
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,717
I mean, what, are we in high school?

1084
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,454
Well, we're
certainly drinking like we are.

1085
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,223
Why don't you have a seat over here

1086
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,325
and tell me all about it, hmm?

1087
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,160
I just feel like an idiot.

1088
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,797
I can't believe that I would
let myself care for him again.

1089
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,332
I mean, why?

1090
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,667
So I get hurt?

1091
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,936
Um, no, because you're a kind person

1092
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,405
who puts the needs of
others before your own.

1093
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:51,608
It's a horrible irony that
my father invented.

1094
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,343
But you don't do that.

1095
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,145
You just take what you want.

1096
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,881
Since the beginning of time.

1097
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,416
That's nice.

1098
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,618
(both chuckle)

1099
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,556
Uh...

1100
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,294
What's happening?

1101
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,898
It would seem that I'm saying no.

1102
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:18,368
But you've been trying to get
me into bed since day one.

1103
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,903
Why are you saying no?

1104
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,931
Well, frankly, my dear, I'm
as baffled as you are.

1105
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,507
I mean, usually I'd leap at the chance

1106
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,375
to fulfill my carnal desire, but...

1107
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:29,980
(sighs) for some reason, I can't.

1108
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,448
What am I doing?

1109
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,450
Why am I here, drunk,
throwing myself at you?

1110
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,185
This is so sad.

1111
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,953
Well, it happens to the best, I promise.

1112
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,955
But not to me.

1113
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,958
I don't do this.

1114
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:45,962
This is something...

1115
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,931
my mom would do.

1116
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,333
(chuckles) That's who'd do it.

1117
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,337
Come here.

1118
00:42:57,008 --> 00:43:00,410
We don't all turn into
our parents, Detective.

1119
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:02,212
(laughing) I mean, look at me.

1120
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,415
I don't think I've ever been the
son that He wants me to be.

1121
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:08,351
- I, uh...
- (snoring)

1122
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,061
Oh, God.
