1
00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:05,787
Gentlemen, <i>Star Wars</i> day
is rapidly approaching.

2
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:07,539
We should finalize our plans.

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,607
What? That's a real thing?

4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,777
What is it, <i>Star Wars</i> Christmas?

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,380
No. Don't be ridiculous.

6
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,332
That's Wookiee Life Day.

7
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,918
So, when is it?

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,637
Uh, well, it's not
May the fifth...

9
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,557
and it's not
May the third...

10
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:31,980
It's May the fourth.

11
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:35,483
Get it?

12
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:38,520
May the fourth
be with you?

13
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:41,806
"May the force be with you."
Get it?

14
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,576
Oh, no. This face
wasn't because I didn't get it.

25
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:16,753
Come in.

26
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:20,590
Hey, you got a second?

27
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:21,741
Yes.

28
00:01:21,743 --> 00:01:23,076
Actually, I'm glad you're here.

29
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:26,663
I-I'm working on the
<i>Star Wars</i> Day schedule.

30
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:30,066
Now, I have a window built in
after <i>Phantom Menace,</i>

31
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:32,018
for complaining, but...

32
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:37,107
...I'm worried an hour
won't be enough time.

33
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:42,862
Sheldon, I-I've got
some bad news.

34
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:43,980
What is it

35
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:46,783
I just read online

36
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:49,435
that Arthur Jeffries
passed away.

37
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:53,306
Professor Proton is dead?

38
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:56,159
Sorry, buddy.

39
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:08,555
What are you doing?

40
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:11,774
Comforting you?

41
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:14,093
Y-Your heart might be
in the right place,

42
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:16,346
but your head, chest and
arms certainly aren't.

43
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:20,733
Anyway, the-the
funeral's on Sunday.

44
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:23,353
But, that's
<i>Star Wars</i> Day.

45
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:25,471
Yeah... um...

46
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:27,941
of all the things about this
that are sad,

47
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:30,810
that might not be number one.

48
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:34,447
You okay?
I know he meant a lot to you.

49
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:36,482
I'm fine.

50
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:39,318
Okay.

51
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,591
Yet he cried when they changed
the Raisin Bran box.

52
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:48,578
This, uh,
this is something interesting

53
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,046
boys and girls.

54
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:53,750
After an owl eats,
he spits up part of his meal,

55
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:57,453
that he can't digest,
in the form of a pellet.

56
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:01,758
Is-Isn't that a hoot?

57
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,867
We'll be right back
after I fire my writers.

58
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,804
Oh, shut up.

59
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:17,040
Watching your
old friend?

60
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:19,075
Hmm. Yes.

61
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,326
Look at him, Amy.

62
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:21,844
It's such a shame.

63
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:24,547
Struck down
in the prime of my life.

64
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:29,535
Do you want me to go to
the funeral with you?

65
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:31,387
Oh, I'm not going
to the funeral.

66
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,805
Why not?

67
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:35,041
All those people
blowing their noses.

68
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:39,062
You can't tell the sick
from the sad. Mm.

69
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:43,182
I'll be at home celebrating
<i>Star Wars</i> Day, as planned.

70
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:45,401
Are you sure you don't
want to go say good-bye?

71
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:51,090
Amy, mourning the inevitable
is a complete waste of time.

72
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:53,743
And watching a bunch
of goofy space movies

73
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:55,995
you've seen hundreds
of times isn't?

74
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:58,598
If we were in
a physical relationship,

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,283
you just lost sex tonight.

76
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:05,004
Hey, guys.

77
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:08,124
Hey, Penny.
Happy <i>Star Wars</i> Day.

78
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:11,594
Okay.

79
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:13,579
Can I make you
breakfast?

80
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:17,767
Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar
is open for business.

81
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,086
No, thanks. Leonard and I
are just going to the funeral.

82
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:22,254
You sure. Not even coffee?

83
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,423
We have R2-Decaf.

84
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:28,311
Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?

85
00:04:29,446 --> 00:04:31,097
And if you're not
in the mood for coffee,

86
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:33,650
I can always make you
a Chai Tea-3PO.

87
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:37,603
Oh, I get it-- like C-3PO.

88
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:39,572
What happened to me?

89
00:04:39,574 --> 00:04:42,441
Hey, uh, Sheldon,
you want anything?

90
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:43,993
Uh, no, thank you.

91
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:45,444
You're being so quiet.

92
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:49,198
Are you upset
or are you just rebooting?

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,967
I'm fine.

94
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:52,335
Sweetie, are you sure

95
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:54,620
you don't want to
come with us to the funeral?

96
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:56,839
Oh, I appreciate the
offer, but Arthur is gone

97
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:59,092
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

98
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:01,644
When Darth Vader
struck down Obi-Wan,

99
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,347
did Luke cry like a baby
and go to his funeral?

100
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:05,348
No.

101
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,566
He blew up the Death Star.

102
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:08,318
Why do I know this?!

103
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:11,804
Arthur Jeffries
was a scientist.

104
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:13,272
I'm sure he didn't care about

105
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:15,641
silly superstitions
like funerals.

106
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:18,077
You know, if he were here,
I think he'd say,

107
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,946
"Enjoy <i>Star Wars</i> Day."

108
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:23,082
He was 84;
he'd say, "Where's my pudding?"

109
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:27,070
Before you go, at least
let me pack you some

110
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:30,089
Attack of the Scones
for the road.

111
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,759
Oh, like <i>Attack</i>
<i>of the Clones.</i>

112
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,927
We are leaving
right now.

113
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:39,198
Arthur passing away
was harder on Sheldon

114
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,850
than he's ready to admit.

115
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:42,518
Really hoping
this will cheer him up.

116
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,686
Me, too.

117
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:45,054
Although, it
might've been

118
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:47,440
thoughtless of us to
bake a Death Star cake.

119
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:51,177
No, it combines two of
Sheldon's favorite things:

120
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:52,645
chocolate chips

121
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:56,115
and the ability to destroy a
planet at the push of a button.

122
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:59,152
Well, anyway, it'll be a
nice surprise for the boys.

123
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:01,571
And Howie doesn't think I
take his interests seriously,

124
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:04,290
so hopefully this will keep
him fooled for a while.

125
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:08,327
Okay, let's get the fondant
and start decorating.

126
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:09,796
This is pretty cool.

127
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:12,382
You don't see too many
spherical cakes.

128
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,820
I wonder why that is.

129
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:26,212
I have a confession to make.
Hmm?

130
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:28,314
I've never been
to a funeral before.

131
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:29,315
Really?

132
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:31,217
I just never knew
anyone that died.

133
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:33,653
I had a pet pig
when I was a kid.

134
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:36,105
I mean, when he died,
we didn't have a funeral,

135
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:38,191
we had a barbecue.

136
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:43,663
Yeah, we won't be
eating Arthur tonight.

137
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:50,402
I didn't know him very well,
but I still really liked him.

138
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:53,539
It's weird that he's...
just gone.

139
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,091
I know.

140
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:57,593
I feel like I want to cry.

141
00:06:57,595 --> 00:06:59,578
Oh... that's-that's fine.

142
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,097
Go ahead.

143
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,720
I can't do it
with you staring at me.

144
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,555
Sorry.

145
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,094
No, I'm dry.

146
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:17,647
You're a big crybaby--
you start, I'll join in.

147
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:20,650
I am not a crybaby.

148
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:21,934
<i>Toy Story 3?</i>

149
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:25,238
The toys were holding hands
in a furnace!

150
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,945
Look, A-Arthur lived
a full life.

151
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:36,299
And he inspired
a lot of people.

152
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:39,252
Sure, he-he was
my childhood hero,

153
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:42,805
but... the fact that
I got to work with him,

154
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:45,591
side by side,
before he...

155
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:48,460
died was...

156
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:51,597
it was... it was a gift.

157
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,150
It was a gift.

158
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:56,486
Thank you for being
the emotional one

159
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:58,521
in this relationship.

160
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:01,140
I got your back.

161
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:02,608
Yeah.

162
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:06,946
Okay, here we go.

163
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:09,248
<i>Episode I--</i>
<i>The Phantom Menace.</i>

164
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:11,817
Let's get this over with.

165
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,953
Since we all agree
<i>Episode I</i> isn't our favorite,

166
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,371
maybe we just skip it this time.

167
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:17,456
Yeah, Howard,
I think you of all people

168
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,824
should avoid espousing
the principle

169
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:20,626
that if something
is not our favorite

170
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,512
we should just get rid of it.

171
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:28,334
You know, I heard this way
of watching the movies

172
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:31,637
called the Machete Order, where
you watch <i>Episodes IV</i> and <i>V,</i>

173
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,389
then skip <i>Episode I,</i>

174
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:35,775
watch <i>II</i> and <i>III</i>
as a flashback,

175
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:37,310
and then finish with <i>VI.</i>

176
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:39,445
Okay, so you'd lose
most of Jar Jar,

177
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:42,281
all the trade route talk,
and the boring senate hearings,

178
00:08:42,283 --> 00:08:45,568
which are like watching C-SPAN
with monsters.

179
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:48,170
Get rid of the
trade route part?

180
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:50,406
Then how would Palpatine
get Chancellor Valorum

181
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:51,807
kicked out of office?

182
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:52,858
Eh.

183
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,911
How would he get
himself elected? How?

184
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:56,646
Can we get through one holiday

185
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:59,832
without you saying
something ridiculous?

186
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,133
It was just a suggestion.

187
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:03,419
Well, you know what else
was just a suggestion?

188
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,421
"Why don't we change
the Raisin Bran box?"

189
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:08,341
Hmm? And you know
who got hurt by that?

190
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:10,259
Every single person
who eats breakfast!

191
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:15,014
Wow.

192
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:16,065
I think he's taking

193
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,100
this Professor Proton thing
pretty hard.

194
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:21,487
Should we try to console him?

195
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:24,774
Or... should we
respect his privacy

196
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:27,059
in this moment of grief?

197
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,745
By staying here
and watching the movie.

198
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:32,248
That's what
good friends would do!

199
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:43,680
Well, at least
without Sheldon here,

200
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:46,050
we got to start
with <i>Episode IV.</i>

201
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,434
Mm, true.

202
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:51,872
I do feel guilty about him.

203
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:52,923
Me, too.

204
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,974
Maybe we should see
how he's doing.

205
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:55,008
Yeah.

206
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,677
But after the cantina scene.
Obviously.

207
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,502
Look at Arthur...

208
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,605
cracking up at a joke
I told him.

209
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:14,078
I'll never hear
that laugh again.

210
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,713
You never
heard it <i>that</i> time.

211
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:22,636
Arthur!

212
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:24,805
I thought you were dead.

213
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,256
I am.

214
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:29,459
Oh, it-it's fantastic.

215
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,312
I mean, this is the longest

216
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:36,633
that I've gone without
running into a men's room

217
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,603
in-in years.

218
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:42,439
Why are you here?

219
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,691
I-I don't know.
I was...

220
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:49,062
I was hoping I was going
to haunt my ex-wife.

221
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:52,749
I know why.

222
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,985
You've come
to me because

223
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,505
you're my Obi-Wan.

224
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:01,341
I'm-I'm not...
I'm not familiar with that.

225
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:04,461
Is... is-is that an...

226
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,281
an Internet?

227
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:10,601
Wow.

228
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,604
Uh, you're dead,
so I'm going to let that slide.

229
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,358
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character
from <i>Star Wars.</i>

230
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,726
After his
physical demise,

231
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:24,298
he comes to Luke Skywalker
as his mentor in spirit form.

232
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,284
Well, that...
that clears that up.

233
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,486
Yeah.

234
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:32,973
You must be here
to give me advice.

235
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:41,448
Well, this... this is weird.

236
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,701
Most-most of my robes open in...

237
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,870
in the back.

238
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,708
Those are your Jedi robes.

239
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:55,429
Oh, wait. What...?

240
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:58,048
What-what... what is this?

241
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,434
Oh! Be careful
with that!

242
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:02,853
Whoa!

243
00:12:09,894 --> 00:12:11,578
Whoa!

244
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,083
Oh, neato.

245
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:24,791
I'm, uh... I'm going
to need a Band-Aid.

246
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:30,247
So...

247
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,132
what did you think
of your first funeral?

248
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:36,586
Well, I don't want to be a jerk,
but it was kind of a bummer.

249
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,940
Yeah, well, when I die,
you can rent a bounce house.

250
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:42,226
You think about dying?

251
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:46,263
Mm. Well, I think more about
if I'd have any regrets.

252
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,648
What would you regret?

253
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,701
Mm, you know,
that I didn't travel more,

254
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,453
take more risks,
learn another language.

255
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:56,073
You know Klingon.

256
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,624
That's true.

257
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,793
No, I meant that
as a regret.

258
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:05,551
I just thought of one more.

259
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,385
What's that?

260
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,805
I regret not saying "yes"
when you asked me to marry you.

261
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,893
Well, it just wasn't
the right time.

262
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,845
Yeah.

263
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,680
And this is also
not the right time.

264
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:20,565
Do not propose.

265
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,350
What?

266
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:24,736
I know that face.
That's your propose face.

267
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,768
I was not gonna propose.
It's already two to one.

268
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:27,819
What's two to one?

269
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:29,570
I proposed twice,
you proposed once. Two to one.

270
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:31,404
Oh, my... It's
not a contest.

271
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:32,789
I don't know what
you're upset about.

272
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,107
I'm the one who's losing.
Okay.

273
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:36,942
Fine. Would you feel
better if I propose

274
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:38,661
so you could turn
me down again?

275
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:40,046
Yeah, I think I would.

276
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:42,048
Okay. Leonard,
will you marry me?

277
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,667
Hmm.

278
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:45,968
No, don't you dare.

279
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,471
You reject me right
now and tie things up.

280
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:52,558
It's just such a big decision.

281
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,677
I don't want
to have any regrets.

282
00:13:57,264 --> 00:13:59,932
Did you ever watch
Professor Proton

283
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:01,150
when you were a kid?

284
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:02,468
No.

285
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,803
My dad controlled the TV,

286
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:05,638
so unless someone
was a Texas Ranger,

287
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,940
Jake or the Fatman,
we didn't see it.

288
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,778
I never watched him, either,
but he seems to be the reason

289
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,446
that Sheldon got interested
in science.

290
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:14,947
Not me. I got
into science

291
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:17,149
'cause I was always the
smallest kid in school,

292
00:14:17,151 --> 00:14:19,168
so I thought if I
became a scientist,

293
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,921
I could invent a formula
that made me taller.

294
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:23,673
That's cute.

295
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:25,958
Yeah, I thought it was
working for a while,

296
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,326
but then I found out

297
00:14:27,328 --> 00:14:31,130
my brother was just lowering the
pencil marks on the door frame.

298
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:32,215
How about you?

299
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:34,317
Oh, I guess
it must have been

300
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:37,270
back when I was
in the Girl Sprouts.

301
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:39,672
Girl <i>Sprouts?</i>

302
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:42,475
My mom made it up as an
alternative to the Girl Scouts.

303
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:44,560
She didn't want me
selling cookies

304
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:47,113
on some street corner
"like a whore."

305
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:53,319
How did that get
you into science?

306
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:54,954
Oh, I went to the library

307
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:58,207
and took out a book on biology
to see what whores did.

308
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:05,030
On the one hand,
if I say yes...

309
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:07,049
This isn't funny anymore.

310
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:08,718
Just say no
so we're done with this.

311
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,536
Will you marry me or not?

312
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:14,106
Ooh, interesting. Did you just
propose to me again?

313
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:16,375
No.
Really?

314
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:18,311
Because I just heard,
"Will you marry me?"

315
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:21,480
That's two
proposals, one day.

316
00:15:21,482 --> 00:15:24,049
Sounds like someone wants
to spend the rest of her life

317
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:26,886
telling people how to spell
the name Hofstadter.

318
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:30,940
You know what? Fine.
Do whatever you want.

319
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:32,775
Hey.

320
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,911
Penny, don't get upset.

321
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:37,113
Here.

322
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:41,083
I love you, but, no,
I will not marry you.

323
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:42,702
Thank you.

324
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:44,069
Now, about that
second proposal.

325
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:46,789
On the one hand...

326
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:00,019
Where... where... where are we?

327
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:04,190
This is the
swampland of Dagobah.

328
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:07,059
It's where Luke was trained
in the ways of the Jedi.

329
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:08,311
Oh.

330
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:11,564
Too bad.
I thought it was Florida.

331
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:22,241
When Obi-Wan came to Luke
on this very spot,

332
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:25,610
he gave him all sorts
of helpful advice.

333
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:28,113
So, um...

334
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:31,033
what do you got for me?

335
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:34,253
Um...

336
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,455
always...

337
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:38,741
get... get a prenup.

338
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,730
That's it?

339
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:48,484
I thought there'd be more
of a reason why you're here.

340
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:52,020
Well, why-why do <i>you</i> think
I'm here?

341
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:55,607
I suppose it has something to do
with your recent passing.

342
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:58,577
Is-is this the...
the first time

343
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:01,146
you've lost, you know,
someone close to you?

344
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:03,282
Oh, no. No.

345
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:06,702
I've already had to say good-bye
to 11 Dr. Whos.

346
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:13,041
Yeah, I've-I've outlived
a few of my doctors, too.

347
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:19,014
Of course, my grandfather
died when I was five.

348
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:21,833
My father died when I was 14.

349
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:24,553
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

350
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:26,722
And now you're gone, too.

351
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:31,360
It's like all the men I've
looked up to have gone away.

352
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:34,396
Well, you know, it's...

353
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:37,900
it's okay to...
to be sad about them.

354
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:42,738
Just... just make sure,
you know, you appreciate

355
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,707
those who... who are
still there for you.

356
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:49,578
But I do appreciate them.

357
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,581
Well, then,

358
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,551
what am I doing in a swamp...

359
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:03,392
...dressed like Friar Tuck?

360
00:18:08,932 --> 00:18:11,583
Appreciate them, Sheldon.

361
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:16,221
Hey, buddy.

362
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:18,323
Heard you're having a rough day.
You all right?

363
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,075
I'm okay.

364
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:23,228
How was the funeral?

365
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:26,915
It was nice, you know.

366
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:29,084
A lot of people showed up,

367
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:32,070
told some great stories
about him.

368
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:35,424
Did you know that Arthur's son
is a high school sci...?

369
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:53,775
Hey, the guys are about
to start <i>Jedi.</i>

370
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:55,110
You want to go watch?

371
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:56,761
I do.

372
00:18:58,114 --> 00:19:01,650
After I make them go back and
watch one through five first.

373
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:06,805
Sheldon, that-that'll
take us all night.

374
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,240
That's true.

375
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:10,626
Oh, it's a good thing
I had a nap.

376
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:18,884
Boy, some of the
physical comedy

377
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:21,887
with Jar Jar is a
little tough to watch.

378
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:26,992
At least they toned him down
in the second one.

379
00:19:26,994 --> 00:19:29,511
Yeah, he is
pretty stupid.

380
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:34,816
Hey, we can say it.
You can't.

381
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:37,686
Hey, guys.

382
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,237
Happy <i>Star Wars</i> Day!

383
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,073
Wow!

384
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:43,442
- A Death Star cake!
- Yeah.

385
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:44,743
We were hoping
it might cheer you up.

386
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:45,661
And even though

387
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:46,945
it meant we had to
miss the movies,

388
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:48,196
we could still be
part of the fun.

389
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:49,197
Well, you didn't
miss anything.

390
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,315
We just started over.

391
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:52,501
Son of a bitch.

392
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:13,172
You're back.

393
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:15,340
Yeah, apparently, um,

394
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:18,143
I'm here whenever...
when-whenever you need me.

395
00:20:18,145 --> 00:20:19,978
That's nice.

396
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,898
May-Maybe for you.

397
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:27,703
Why do I need you now?

398
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:30,155
Well, as near as I could tell,

399
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:33,542
you-you fell asleep
watching <i>Star Wars,</i>

400
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:37,245
and now you're-you're dreaming
you're watching <i>Star Wars.</i>

401
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,014
So?

402
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:42,033
I mean, don't-don't you see
a problem there?

403
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:43,368
I mean, how-how

404
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,705
you're spending
your limited time on Earth?

405
00:20:48,452 --> 00:20:50,618
Not at all.

406
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,055
Okay, good luck to you.
