- She used

my phone to call somebody.

185
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:22,951
Her boyfriend, I don't know.

186
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,619
She wanted to go over to his place,

187
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,487
- he threatened to kill her.

Did you come here to gloat?

198
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,881
I just came to see how the

199
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:56,517
supreme goddess was acclimating.

200

Nothing I can't handle.

I'm still on a sabbatical from work,

209
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:18,072
so I spend the bulk of my day

210
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:21,509
at home with the... children.

00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:33,154
I discovered a trick with him.

216
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:35,957
Whenever he asks a question,
I just have sex with him.

217
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,725
Seems to render him mute.

218
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:40,695
Hmm. Took me a while to
figure that one out.

Daria until 30 minutes

00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:08,683
before she died.

262
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,418
Exactly. He would've barely had time

00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,387
Your convertible.

360
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:30,422
Fine. But you need to take

361
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,057
the detective out and have fun.

362
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,658
Three drinks should do the trick.

363
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:36,528
(chuckles) Sucker's bet. Easy.

364
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:38,015
Yes, but you're not allowed to tie her up

365
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,352
and pour booze down her throat.

366
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:40,365
Less easy.

367
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,800
Fine.

368
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,668
- All right. Deal.
- (shouts): I said get naked!

369
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:44,936
Oh, hello.

370
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:47,172
Want to watch?

371
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:48,507
(phone beeps)

372
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,709
Okay, you were the last
one to talk to Daria,

373
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,344
you're telling me you have no idea

374
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,612
who she was with last night?

375
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:56,448
No. She was having a girls' night.

376
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,385
She was roomies with another
waitress, uh, Naomi.

377
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:02,854
Maybe she was with her.

378
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:04,163
Do not leave town.

379
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:07,826
So did Casanova's alibi check out?

380
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:09,694
Working on it, but in the meantime,

381
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:12,430
Daria's roommate, Naomi,
might have an idea of her timeline.

382
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,467
Oh, lovely. Then can we
go for grilled polenta?

383
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,702
Well, I can't focus on an
empty stomach, Detective.

384
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,571
(sighs)

385
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:21,147
Hey...

386
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:31,983
Oh. Hi.

387
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,251
Hey, uh...

388
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:35,820
I just wanted to return this.

389
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,122
Oh. Uh...

390
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,124
<i>Therapeutic Truth.</i>

391
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,859
So much for that, right?

392
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:43,762
(chuckles)

393
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,964
Are you okay?

394
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:47,999
(exhales)

395
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:50,869
One exhalation yes, two...

396
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,038
- none of my business?
- Yeah, listen.

397
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,073
Thanks for your concern,
but, um, I'm fine.

398
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,309
No more false pretenses, remember?

399
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:00,497
Friendship means honesty.

400
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,614
You can talk to me, Amenadiel.

401
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,749
Apparently, that <i>is</i> your real name.

402
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,327
(laughs) It is.

403
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,491
This is hard to explain.

404
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,760
Uh, it's kind of a, uh...

405
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,995
physical problem.

406
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:18,196
Oh?

407
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,799
And things aren't working
the way they used to.

408
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:24,069
Oh.

409
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,004
And I-I don't, I don't know
what to do about that.

410
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:29,074
I see. Well, you know, it's very common.

411
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,408
I doubt that.

412
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:31,710
Generally stress related.

413
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,111
It <i>is</i> very stressful.

414
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:34,245
My advice?

415
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:36,081
Don't overthink it.

416
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:39,317
You need to relax.
Try to put it out of your mind.

417
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:40,852
Maybe have a bit of fun.

418
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:42,354
- Fun?
- Yes.

419
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,689
Maybe a cocktail.

420
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,200
And before you know it...

421
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,566
It doesn't make you any
less of a man, Amenadiel.

422
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:56,009
Not even a bit.

423
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:02,048
(seagulls squawking)

424
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,176
Was everything okay?

425
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:07,912
I haven't seen Daria or Naomi all week.

426
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:09,748
We feed each other's cats.

427
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:12,417
Oh, gosh, I detest cats.

428
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:14,452
Want an animal to stare
at you with contempt?

429
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,647
Get a cat. Open box of excrement

430
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,156
in your house? Cat. (sniffs)

431
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,491
Oh, gosh. Can you smell that?

432
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,426
Foul, incontinent creatures.

433
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:24,370
That's not a cat smell.
That's a dead smell.

434
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:30,943
Oh, my God! Naomi!

435
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,444
She's got the same
triangular stamp as Daria.

436
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,680
Same signs of poison.

437
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,815
Well, well. Talk about a
girls' night gone wrong.

438
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:53,252
♪ ♪

439
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,082
Lovely. Why don't we
go up to the penthouse,

440
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,451
and I can show you the
original Stairway to Heaven.

441
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,485
(chuckles)

442
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,054
Ah, Detective.

443
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,922
After 6:00 on a school night?

444
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,302
Ella's final forensic report came in.

445
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:08,301
Right.

446
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:09,592
Um...

447
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:10,909
Sorry. Can this wait?

448
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,010
(chuckles): I mean,

449
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,545
those deaths were fiendishly tragic,

450
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,947
but I'm pretty certain that
tomorrow, during office hours,

451
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:17,916
our dead girls will still be dead.

452
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:18,917
I just wanted to run a couple...

453
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,318
MAZE: Good. Saved me a trip.

454
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:21,853
You, me, drinking. Now.

455
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:23,955
- I'm in!
- What are you doing here?

456
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,857
Lucifer said I should drop by.
But we're working.

457
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,125
No, <i>you're</i> working.

458
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,226
Who the hell is she?

459
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:30,128
Oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Ella!

460
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,693
CHLOE: I was about to
give him the rundown

461
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:34,462
- on your report. Do you want to...
- No, go for it.

462
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:35,863
I got to dehydrate. Whew!

463
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:39,462
Okay. Anyhow, first off,
there was tissue damage

464
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:40,701
to Daria's stomach lining,

465
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:42,069
caused by liquid nitrogen,

466
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,071
the stuff that makes
fancy cocktails smoke.

467
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:45,873
It's probably how she
ingested the poison.

468
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:46,785
Well, excellent lead, Detective,

469
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,643
but you just ruined my ménage à trois.

470
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:52,017
Second, I assumed that Daria
was at a club on Gower,

471
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,869
and we found an abandoned
building on the corner.

472
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,450
It looked like they had
recently had a party there.

473
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,451
Fascinating.

474
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:58,119
I'm thinking it was a rave, so...

475
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,854
Any way you could make some
phone calls to help me out?

476
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:01,622
You know, you seem to have
your finger on the pulse.

477
00:17:01,632 --> 00:17:03,658
Not the appendage I'd
hoped to be pulsing by now.

478
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:05,359
I know that hood.

479
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,461
There's a great tiki bar

480
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:08,196
across the street from that building.

481
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:09,363
I know the bartender.

482
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:10,565
Course you do.

483
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:12,300
We could go and have a drink,

484
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,768
ask about the dead girls.

485
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:16,170
Yes. That sounds like a
very good lead, Detective.

486
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,672
If you want to retrace the steps

487
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:19,540
of two hot girls on a girls' night,

488
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,642
you need to think like two
hot girls on a girls' night.

489
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,752
With your lady parts.

490
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:25,947
And piña coladas in hand.

491
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,216
Oh, my God, I <i>love</i> piña coladas!

492
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:29,758
Lovely!

493
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:37,333
(slurping)

494
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:43,397
So, I was watching <i>Chinatown,</i> right?

495
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,066
And all of a sudden, it hits me.

496
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:47,902
I need to go to L.A. I mean,
do you ever feel like

497
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:49,537
God is telling you to do something?

498
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:50,771
No.

499
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:53,096
Oh. You think Chloe's gonna drink that?

500
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,090
No.

501
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,820
Hey, guys. Do you
recognize this hand stamp?

502
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:00,281
What about these women?

503
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,083
No.

504
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:03,684
Okay, look. I'm LAPD,

505
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:05,386
and if there's any info
that you can give me

506
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:07,355
- on any...
- (snorts, laughs)

507
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,690
How <i>not</i> to get laid.

508
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,527
I'm not trying to get laid, Maze.

509
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:14,028
I don't get it.

510
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:15,796
Well, did you talk to the bartender?

511
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:18,200
Yeah. He said something was going on

512
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:19,583
across the street in the
abandoned building.

513
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,457
I put a call in for a warrant to the judge,

514
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:22,537
and I'm waiting to hear back.

515
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:24,505
Great. Looks like you
have some time to kill.

516
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:25,439
Have a drink.

517
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,375
No. I'm gonna call it a night.

518
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:28,342
Hello, ladies.

519
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:31,012
Hi. What are you doing here?

520
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,346
Maze invited me.

521
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:34,315
- She said it's girls' night.
- MAZE: Yeah.

522
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:37,118
No. I'm working a double homicide.

523
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:39,687
Would it kill you to just relax for once?

524
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:41,088
- (sighs)
- All you do is

525
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:42,757
work, work, work.

526
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,091
Wow. Like you're one to talk.

527
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,022
You're at Lucifer's beck and call 24/7.

528
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,929
It's like you're his personal concierge.

529
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:50,665
I'm not his personal anything, anymore.

530
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:54,027
Hmm. Well, you basically still
live there, and it's not like

531
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:55,344
he's pouring <i>you</i> any drinks.

532
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:58,472
Least I know how to have fun.

533
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,649
What about pleasure?

534
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:02,685
Men?

535
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,212
When's the last time you had sex?

536
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:06,738
ELLA: Hey, why does
everything always have to be

537
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:08,482
- about work or sex?
- LINDA: Yeah, I agree.

538
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:12,320
Girls' night, done right,
is about female bonding.

539
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,655
- Exactly.
- Really getting to know each other.

540
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:18,359
Sharing problems,
origin stories, secrets.

541
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:20,094
- Can't we just drink?
- Fine.

542
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:22,063
I'll start. Um...

543
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,132
I worked my way through med school as

544
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:26,334
a phone sex operator.

545
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:28,903
1-800-ProfessorFeelGood.

546
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:31,372
I would totally call that.

547
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:32,406
Nice.

548
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,652
I'm Ella, by the way.

549
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:35,364
I love that we just
skipped the small talk.

550
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:36,110
Yes.

551
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,512
Um, okay. I'll go next, I guess. Um...

552
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:39,922
I used to steal cars.

553
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:42,216
Who's next?

554
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,018
I was forged in the bowels of Hell

555
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:47,288
to torture the guilty
for all of eternity.

556
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:49,557
Interesting share.

557
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,559
Okay, so...

558
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:52,860
Now, you go, Chloe.

559
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,595
Female trust.

560
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:55,596
Come on.

561
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:56,964
What's on your mind?

562
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:59,100
What's on my mind...

563
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,002
like, other than the case?

564
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:02,277
Yeah.

565
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:06,548
Um...

566
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:09,977
A little divorce.

567
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:11,212
- Uh...
- MAZE: Mm-hmm.

568
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:14,882
Single parenthood...

569
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:18,185
uh, possible homelessness and...

570
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:22,189
most likely many, many cats in my future.

571
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:24,158
Or things that require batteries.

572
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:25,326
Okay, you know, that's-that's...

573
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:26,694
that's what I'm talking about.

574
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:29,330
You guys, this is so fun!

575
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,575
- Is it?
- Yes!

576
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,900
Yeah, uh, tequila, stat.

577
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,502
- Yes.
- Keep 'em coming!

578
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:36,003
LINDA: This is really
gonna help you feel,

579
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:37,646
you know, anything.

580
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:42,009
LUCIFER: Ugh!

581
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:43,411
Cosmopolitan?

582
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:45,379
Perhaps this really <i>is</i> girls' night.

583
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:48,282
There are only two reasons to
drink alone, brother.

584
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:49,684
Either you're a chronic dullard,

585
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:51,852
or you're trying to avoid your problems.

586
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:53,154
If it's the latter, I approve.

587
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:55,189
My problems <i>are</i> your problems.

588
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,491
Ooh! Aren't we the little empath?

589
00:20:57,501 --> 00:21:01,028
You think letting Mom stay here
on earth doesn't affect us all?

590
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:01,962
- (scoffs)
- Why?

591
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:02,971
Because you think Dad is gonna

592
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,032
forgive and forget about the
fact that you broke a deal?

593
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,600
Haven't broken anything.

594
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,702
I found a loophole.

595
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:09,704
As such, I'm not
thinking about it at all.

596
00:21:09,714 --> 00:21:10,671
You should try it.

597
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:12,648
There will be consequences!

598
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:16,477
I don't get it.

599
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,112
If you're so concerned,
why don't you just

600
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:19,380
fly Mum back to Hell?

601
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,531
Because I can't!

602
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:25,052
That was a tad dramatic.

603
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:26,020
Why not?

604
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,696
It's complicated.

605
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:30,825
Never fear, fun brother's here.

606
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:33,062
I'm gonna show you the
magic of distraction.

607
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:35,596
But no more girly drinks. All right?

608
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:37,264
Cosmos are yummy.

609
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:40,468
Oh... Bourbon. Stat. Keep 'em coming.

Thank you, Los Angeles!

620
00:21:57,461 --> 00:22:00,888
(laughing)

621
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:02,690
And then Lucifer's all like...

622
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,127
(imitating Lucifer):
"Hey Chloe, name three friends

623
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:09,163
that you could go call
and have a drink with."

624
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:10,631
- So smug, you know?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

625
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:13,100
Well, one... two... three!

626
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,929
CHLOE: So, you're saying,

627
00:22:13,953 --> 00:22:15,354
if I called you guys,

628
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:16,771
you would drop everything

629
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:18,205
and come and have a drink with me?

630
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:20,741
Mm-hmm. 'Cause that is what
girlfriends do for each other.

631
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:23,010
Yes, especially during tough times.

632
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,411
Exactly.

633
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:26,680
I've never had friends like that.

634
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,681
Like, ever.

635
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:29,350
Well, you're a lot more tolerable

636
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,417
when you're drunk, Decker.

637
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:31,886
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

638
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:33,087
And then Lucifer's like,

639
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:36,223
"You use work to avoid having fun."

640
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:37,892
Oh, yeah. Well, not anymore, lady.

641
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:39,226
'Cause we're your tribe, now.

642
00:22:39,236 --> 00:22:41,695
And we like to party!

643
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:42,930
(howling)

644
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,332
I wish I had my knives.
We could have made a blood pact.

645
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:46,667
- Ooh, next time.
- Aww... Yeah, yeah.

646
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,569
Next time? This is progress.

647
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:49,804
To tribes!

648
00:22:49,814 --> 00:22:51,572
To tribes!

649
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:53,207
Sip it.

650
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:54,960
(camera clicks)

651
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:56,544
I think we should go back up there.

652
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:59,380
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

653
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,948
Mm.

654
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,416
(whooping)

655
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,485
LINDA: Oh, it looks like someone's
made a fourth friend.

656
00:23:04,495 --> 00:23:06,887
Oh, you get it, girl! (whooping)

657
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:08,355
Oh, no!

658
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:10,568
- Abort! Chloe!
- Oh... don't do that.

659
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:12,526
I don't think she...

660
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:14,328
Does she wear contacts?

661
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:15,462
- She's really into him.
- And she's bringing him over.

662
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:16,597
- Is she?
- CHLOE: Look!

663
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:18,465
Same hand stamp

664
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:19,700
as Daria and Naomi!

665
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,601
Where did you get this?

666
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:22,703
I saw some hot women, uh,

667
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:24,905
g-going into a party across
the street last night.

668
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:26,106
- Okay.
- It was just...

669
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:27,208
Do you recognize these women?

670
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:28,142
Did you see these girls there?

671
00:23:28,152 --> 00:23:29,143
(grunts)

672
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:30,244
What's your deal?

673
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:31,946
Hey, she's just asking a few questions.

674
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:34,415
Well, he's taken. So back off, skank!

675
00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:35,716
- I...
- MAZE: Hey!

676
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:38,219
No one calls my skank a skank.

677
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:39,687
- I'm hurting her.
- No! Oh, no, no...

678
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:41,722
No. Okay, no. No, no, Maze.

679
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:42,690
Maze...

680
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,391
Wipe that smile off her face.

681
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:46,727
Maze, remember... aggression

682
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,596
is not the answer, okay.

683
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:50,064
Clearly, this woman is having

684
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:51,432
some serious trust issues.

685
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:52,499
Clearly.

686
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:54,435
Or maybe she's just a raging bitch.

687
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:55,502

Oh...

720
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,941
Oof.

721
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:13,743
Happy hour over already?

722
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:15,245
Must have been some party.

723
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:16,436
Yeah...

724
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:18,548
other than the half hour-ish

725
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,850
from 8:47 to 9:17

726
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,752
that I can't quite remember anything.

727
00:25:22,762 --> 00:25:24,561
(chuckling): Classic Chloe.

728
00:25:24,586 --> 00:25:26,456
Only you would make
a point of remembering

729
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:28,658
the exact amount of
time you can't remember.

730
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:30,260
Mm. Well,

731
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,896
I was lucid enough to destroy a tiki bar

732
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,431
and get a lead on our two dead blondes.

733
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:37,567
I found a guy with a hand stamp.

734
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,610
The same club that Daria
and Naomi went to?

735
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,624
Not a club.

736
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:45,728
More like a roving, pop-up sex party.

737
00:25:45,738 --> 00:25:47,430
Secretive, invite-only,

738
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,765
caters to rich jerks
who like to pay for it.

739
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:50,564
So gross.

740
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,276
So those two girls were sex workers?

741
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:54,236
Looks like it.

742
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:55,905
But the only way to know for sure

743
00:25:55,915 --> 00:25:57,740
is to get you into the next shindig.

744
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,608
Which hand stamp guy told me...

745
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:01,043
Right before he passed out...

746
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:03,279
Is happening as we speak.

747
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:04,447
Me?

748
00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:07,591
Uh-huh. Men only. And I got you a date.

749
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:09,719
- Nope.
- Yes.

750
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:11,087
- Mm-mm. No way.
- Yes.

751
00:26:11,097 --> 00:26:12,855
It's good to have Lucifer
there with you as back up.

752
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:15,299
So they don't think you're a cop.

753
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:18,435
I don't look like a cop.

754
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:21,572
Uh-huh.

755
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:24,734
Hey.

756
00:26:24,744 --> 00:26:25,901
Do I look like a cop?

757
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:29,071
(kitten mewing on video)

758
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:32,141
(laughing)

759
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:34,377
Ah. Finally, you're here. Right.

760
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:35,578
I promise this will be more fun

761
00:26:35,588 --> 00:26:37,646
than light beers and <i>Bachelor</i> reruns.

762
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:38,981
Your jokes never get old.

763
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:40,950
Oh, come on, who doesn't
love a sex party?

764
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,017
Then again, if you're me,

765
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:43,853
every party's a sex party of sorts.

766
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:45,017
DAN: It's illegal, for starters.

767
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,689
Why do you think they change
the location every night?

768
00:26:46,699 --> 00:26:48,657
No liquor license, underage girls...

769
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,159
Well, the world's oldest profession

770
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:51,894
seems to be surviving quite nicely.

771
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:53,996
Hello, chaps.

772
00:26:54,006 --> 00:26:56,265
Yes, my first startup was
a sex club, actually.

773
00:26:56,275 --> 00:26:57,967
Little place called "Eden".
Perhaps you've heard of it?

774
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:01,370
I'm... good. Thank you.

775
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,539
Best case scenario,
this club exploits women.

776
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:05,474
Worst case? It got those
girls a belly full of poison.

777
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:06,409
Mm.

778
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,511
- One other thing.
- Hm?

779
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:11,614
I'm not sure why he's here.

780
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:13,749
Only dullards drink alone.

781
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,384
Yes, he's a tad anxious these days.

782
00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:16,952
I thought a night out would do him good.

783
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:18,687
Right. Well, we have one mission:

784
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:21,390
to find out who knew the dead girls.

785
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,175
And remember... We're undercover, okay?

786
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,728
(chuckling): As if you could look
like anything other than a cop.

787
00:27:25,738 --> 00:27:27,129
I do not look like a cop!

788
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:27,930
Cop.

789
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,332
(sighs with frustration)

790
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:32,301
All right, will you guys just please,

791
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:33,869
for God's sake, be chill?

792
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:36,413
And three rules: no
drinking, no touching...

793
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:38,908
...and just keep everything low-key.

794
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:41,377
- Yes!
- (laughing)

795
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:44,079
- (woman laughing)
- DAN: Oh, my God.

796
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:46,682
This is not helping us find
out who knew the dead girls.

797
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:49,018
Agreed. His shimmy is a tad off-putting.

798
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:50,319
AMENADIEL: Come on, Luci!

799
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:52,254
Come cut a rug with your big bro!

800
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:53,556
LUCIFER: Uh. No, no, no, no, no.

801
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:54,757
White man's overbite,

802
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:56,425
that is definitely where I draw the line.

803
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:57,726
Hold on a second.

804
00:27:57,736 --> 00:27:59,102
Look at the bar.

805
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:02,264
It's liquid nitrogen.

806
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:03,632
It's the same thing that caused damage

807
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,201
to Daria Mitchell's stomach lining.

808
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:06,443
Yes.

809
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:09,605
Hey, buddy.

810
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:10,639
Hey.

811
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,583
What do you know about these two girls?

812
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:17,847
Not so fast, buddy boy.

813
00:28:17,857 --> 00:28:20,850
Seems my martini isn't the
only thing here that's dirty.

814
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,418
- (straining)
- Mmm.

815
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:23,919
A drink to savor, don't you think?

816
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:25,621
Ah... (inhales)

817
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:27,890
Want to explain why you ran?

818
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,725
Come on. You're obviously a cop.

819
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:30,960
- (chuckles)
- Shut it.

820
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,995
I figured you were here to bust me.

821
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:34,797
Yes, we are here to bust you.

822
00:28:34,807 --> 00:28:37,466
For the untimely fate of two
innocent Nebraskan girls.

823
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:39,201
Wait... what?

824
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:40,536
LUCIFER: It's funny how killers go deaf

825
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:42,137
at the moment of reckoning, isn't it?

826
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:43,372
No, no. I...

827
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:44,440
I'm no killer.

828
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,809
I-I-I keep an eye on
the girls that work here

829
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:49,311
and serve the pervs drinks.

830
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:50,379
And pot...

831
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:51,741
Maybe a bit of "E."

832
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:54,083
- What about mandrake?
- Who's Mandrake?

833
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:56,418
Did you put poison in
these two girls' drinks?

834
00:28:56,428 --> 00:28:58,938
No-no. What? No.
I-I remember these girls.

835
00:28:58,963 --> 00:29:01,323
Their drinks were clean when I made 'em.

836
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,642
Who was paying for 'em?

837
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,360
I don't know, it was some
Hollywood dirtbag

838
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,661
with a gold card.

839
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:08,230
You'll need to be a little more specific.

840
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,900
It's... Yuri something.

841
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,501
He's not here tonight though.

842
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,003
I guess your two dead girls

843
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,694
and the other blonde must
have really worn him out.

844
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:16,238
DAN: Wait a minute.

845
00:29:16,248 --> 00:29:17,540
- There were <i>three</i> blondes?
- Yeah.

846
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,875
Your two newbies and their hot friend.

847
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,010
Right. First name:

848
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,344
"Hot", last name "Friend"?

849
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:24,393
They don't use their real names.

850
00:29:24,924 --> 00:29:26,081
She's one of our regulars though.

851
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:28,083
You know, life of the party.

852
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,151
Oh, she won't be the life of anything,

853
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,119
if we don't get to her

854
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:31,754
before lady killer Yuri has his way.

855
00:29:31,764 --> 00:29:32,855
If he hasn't already.

856
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:34,123
(sighing): Thank you.

857
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:35,465
(clears throat)

858
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,230
Oh, silly me.

859
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,197
(sighs)

860
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:44,300
Come on. Rise and shine, Crantini.

861
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,334
- Time to go.
- (groaning)

862
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,669
Yeah. Let's do this.

863
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:47,436
(grunting)

864
00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:51,440
(Lucifer laughing)

865
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,708
Gosh, I wish I got that on video.

866
00:29:52,718 --> 00:29:53,943
Oh, I can get that on video!

867
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:55,874
Hold on. Douche-cam.

868
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:15,733
Must have been some party.

869
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:17,468
Ah, that's funny.

870
00:30:17,478 --> 00:30:19,737
And I'll laugh after we
find this Yuri scumbag.

871
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:21,639
You have anything on the third girl?

872
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:23,641
Bartender said she was, "Blonde, hot,

873
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:24,675
and had an exposed midriff".

874
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:26,978
Which describes half
the population of L.A.

875
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:29,413
Well, the chef's wife, Gisele,
fits that description.

876
00:30:29,423 --> 00:30:31,816
Yeah, but when you saw
her, she was healthy.

877
00:30:31,826 --> 00:30:33,217
You think she could have
worked with Naomi

878
00:30:33,227 --> 00:30:34,585
and Daria at the sex club?

879
00:30:34,595 --> 00:30:36,128
She knew them

880
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:37,555
through her husband's restaurant.

881
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:39,524
I mean... but part-time sex worker?

882
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:41,359
Would that be the first thing
you put on your résumé?

883
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:43,728
No. But if she was there,

884
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:45,796
she was witness to everything
that went down that night.

885
00:30:45,806 --> 00:30:47,965
So, maybe Yuri's after her.

886
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:49,300
Yeah, well, the tech got Yuri's info

887
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,102
from the credit card he
used at the sex party.

888
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:52,270
Only has a P.O. box.

889
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,437
No home address, but I did get

890
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:54,772
a cell and a plate number.

891
00:30:54,782 --> 00:30:55,431
Okay, good.

892
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:56,893
Lucifer and I will go find Yuri,

893
00:30:56,918 --> 00:30:58,342
and, uh,

894
00:30:58,352 --> 00:30:59,443
and, um...

895
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:01,412
- (Lucifer laughing)
- ...you track down Gisele.

896
00:31:01,422 --> 00:31:03,447
(laughing continues)

897
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:04,482
Oh...

898
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:05,624
DAN: Copy that.

899
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:08,076
- _
- That is...

900
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:11,289
What did Maze win

901
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,758
and why does it involve
my tragic drunk face?

902
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:14,992
Just a little wager.

903
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,694
Well, you had a lot on your mind,

904
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:18,329
so I decided to distract you,

905
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:19,705
with "girls' night."

906
00:31:22,243 --> 00:31:23,334
Last night was a setup?

907
00:31:23,344 --> 00:31:25,403
Yes. Well, you had fun, didn't you?

908
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:26,612
You should be thanking me.

909
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,808
What are you doing?

910
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:33,319
- Detective...
- (snaps picture)

911
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:37,529
_

912
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,363
(grunts)

913
00:31:39,827 --> 00:31:41,686
Uh, hey, Davis hasn't seen Gisele,

914
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:43,421
and she's, uh, not answering her cell,

915
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:45,223
so if Yuri has her,
we've got to get there fast.

916
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:46,524
CHLOE: I'm on my way.

917
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:48,826
Detective...

918
00:31:48,836 --> 00:31:51,237
What did you say to her?

919
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:02,506
LAPD. Get out of the car, Yuri.

920
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:03,941
LUCIFER: Good Lord, you could at least

921
00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:05,276
fork out for a room, Yuri.

922
00:32:05,286 --> 00:32:06,978
- (Yuri retching)
- No, no, no, no!

923
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:08,679
Not the Italian leather!

924
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:10,815
Bloody hell!

925
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:13,150
Yeah, more like karma.

926
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,386
We know you were at
the sex club last night,

927
00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:17,655
and you're responsible for
the death of two girls.

928
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:19,290
What do you know about Gisele?

929
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,959
I don't know anyone named Gisele.

930
00:32:21,969 --> 00:32:23,427
You have it all wrong.

931
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:25,696
I only went to that club

932
00:32:25,706 --> 00:32:28,866
because Crystal promised me newbies.

933
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:30,868
I paid five grand apiece

934
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:32,403
for those two sweethearts.

935
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:33,604
Who's Crystal?

936
00:32:33,614 --> 00:32:35,840
She was with Daria and Naomi.

937
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,907
Then you should most definitely

938
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:38,743
- ask for a refund.
- I know.

939
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:41,512
Those girls had no idea
that I was their date.

940
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:42,880
You're telling me Daria and Naomi

941
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,515
had no idea it was a sex club?

942
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:46,384
No.

943
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:48,219
When they found out,
they wanted to leave.

944
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:50,521
Crystal bought them drinks,

945
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:53,224
but they drank them and bailed anyway.

946
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:56,060
I was so upset that I
took the last sip and...

947
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,670
You drank the rest of the poison.

948
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,433
I have been sick ever since.

949
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:03,367
Oh, God.

950
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:05,511
Oh, no, no, no. Not again.

951
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:08,406
Is Gisele Crystal?

952
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:09,774
LUCIFER: Oh, you mean the chef's wife?

953
00:33:09,784 --> 00:33:11,475
Could she be the one who
killed Daria and Naomi?

954
00:33:11,485 --> 00:33:13,077
Well, Daria was sleeping
with her husband,

955
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:15,112
so if anyone had a bone to pick,
it would be her.

956
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:17,515
(panting)

957
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:19,355
Yuri, do you know Crystal's real name?

958
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,086
No. But I have a picture.

959
00:33:22,096 --> 00:33:24,722
Oh, lovely. I'll take that.

960
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:27,458
Right. Ooh, pecker pic.

961
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:29,093
- Pecker pic.
- Eww!

962
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:30,602
Oh, hold on.

963
00:33:32,073 --> 00:33:33,664
CHLOE: That's not Gisele.

964
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:35,966
No, and that blonde hair
doesn't look real either.

965
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:38,069
CHLOE: You're right, it's a wig.

966
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,446
And the girl wearing
it looks real familiar.

967
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:49,113
Oh, it's just rush, rush,
rush in this town, isn't it?

968
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:51,349
Oh, hi, detectives.

969
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,484
I'm just putting a few things in storage.

970
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:54,852
I'm going back home.

971
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:56,587
Right, you can take the
girl out of Nebraska,

972
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:58,956
but you can't take
Nebraska out of the girl.

973
00:33:58,966 --> 00:33:59,957
Or can you?

974
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:02,626
I don't feel safe in L.A. anymore.

975
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:04,762
You wouldn't either if
two of your neighbors

976
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:05,663
wound up dead.

977
00:34:05,688 --> 00:34:07,298
Don't you just hate that?

978
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:09,333
I'm sorry, I have a flight at 3:00.

979
00:34:09,343 --> 00:34:10,534
LUCIFER: Yes, and I've just discovered

980
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:12,269
this wonderful thing called Facebook.

981
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:14,038
- Have you heard of it?
- I have to go, please.

982
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:15,940
'Cause Facebook's heard of you.

983
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,575
It knows that you're a big deal

984
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:18,676
in your small town.

985
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:19,877
A ten back home,

986
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:23,147
but in L.A., just a five.

987
00:34:23,157 --> 00:34:25,249
Things haven't worked out for
you here, have they, Lily?

988
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:28,819
So much heartache, struggle, compromise.

989
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:30,788
It made you desperate enough

990
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:32,790
to turn against your
own sorority sisters,

991
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,824
Daria and Naomi.

992
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:36,227
No. Daria and Naomi were my friends.

993
00:34:36,237 --> 00:34:37,528
- (chuckles)
- CHLOE: Were they?

994
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:39,964
Because we know you were with
them the night they died.

995
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:42,032
You said you hadn't seen 'em for a week.

996
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,267
You have no proof of that.

997
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:47,204
Except for a photo taken by
your charming buddy Yuri.

998
00:34:47,214 --> 00:34:48,572
Nice wig, by the way.

999
00:34:48,582 --> 00:34:51,090
Really brings out the
murder in your eyes.

1000
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:57,856
Seems kitties do have claws.

1001
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:04,428
Please, just let me go.

1002
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:06,430
Is this the part where you
wish I had a gun, Detective?

1003
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,398
Shut up, Lucifer, I got this.

1004
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:10,400
You pretended to be
a friend to those girls.

1005
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,935
Shame on you. (coughs)

1006
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:13,737
They called <i>me!</i>

1007
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:15,572
They were desperate for my help.

1008
00:35:15,582 --> 00:35:18,442
The best workout class, where to hike...

1009
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:19,776
this apartment!

1010
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,012
They asked you for help
and you preyed on them?

1011
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:23,580
I was doing them a favor.

1012
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,549
What, by putting mandrake in their drinks?

1013
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,951
I thought it was an
organic kind of roofie.

1014
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,561
I didn't know that it would kill them.

1015
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:31,688
I was just trying to loosen them up.

1016
00:35:31,698 --> 00:35:33,290
You were trying to make an extra buck

1017
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,725
by bringing in a couple newbies.

1018
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:37,828
I won the Dame Judith
acting award in college.

1019
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:40,998
I was the <i>president</i> of our sorority.

1020
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,333
I should have made it by now!

1021
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:46,436
L.A. was supposed to be easy!

1022
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:48,472
- (cell phone chiming)
- Oh, phones...

1023
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,548
They can be so distracting.

1024
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:58,715
There's a special place in Hell
for women who fake friendships

1025
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:03,687
as a way of manipulating other women!

1026
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:05,964
She's right, you know.

1027
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,593
And I think we have
silver lining, Detective.

1028
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:12,462
What with Lily going away,
and Daria and Naomi dead,

1029
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:14,431
I believe that there's an
apartment vacancy.

1030
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,967
Are you seriously suggesting
that I should move

1031
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:18,335
into a dead girl's apartment?

1032
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,904
No, no, no, the killer's
place is much nicer.

1033
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:23,915
I mean, just look at this view!

1034
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,467
How'd you get in here?

1035
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:53,470
Let's just say Samantha at the front desk

1036
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,440
is no longer into men.

1037
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,575
What, you still mad?

1038
00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:01,645
What was all that stuff
about being my tribe?

1039
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:03,655
You had fun, didn't you?

1040
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:06,683
I don't have time for this.

1041
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:08,727
I have work to do. You can go.

1042
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:15,800
I wasn't totally faking it.

1043
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:21,064
Like when I strangled
psycho chick for the win.

1044
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,432
<i>That</i> was genuine.

1045
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:24,901
Gee, thanks.

1046
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:28,205
You know, I wouldn't
just kick ass for anyone.

1047
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:29,906
Okay, fine, I would.

1048
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:33,477
But this time it was... sweeter.

1049
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:36,413
This is some twisted
version of an apology?

1050
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,382
I don't do apologies.

1051
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:40,191
But I don't want to kill you anymore.

1052
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:44,287
You're a very, very deranged person.

1053
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:46,164
Thanks.

1054
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:48,925
So, we're still good to be roomies, right?

1055
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,293
What are you talking about, <i>roomies?</i>

1056
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:51,328
We shook on it.

1057
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:53,363
Post-karaoke, pre-potbelly dude.

1058
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:54,765
What?

1059
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,299
I told you I was in between places.

1060
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:57,934
You said that you were
looking for someone

1061
00:37:57,944 --> 00:37:59,269
to share expenses.

1062
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,445
Don't you remember?

1063
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:04,775
The missing half hour.

1064
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:08,044
Look... I've got money.

1065
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:10,747
I like your kid, and you dress like crap,

1066
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:12,949
so I won't be stealing
any of your clothes.

1067
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,959
What, you got a better plan?

1068
00:38:18,432 --> 00:38:20,331
You said you wanted fun, Decker.

1069
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:23,067
Fun.

1070
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,837
Oh, my...

1071
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,033
Roommates?

1072
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:31,301
You and Detective Decker?

1073
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,870
(laughs) No, no, no, no, no, no.

1074
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,273
And have I mentioned
"no," and also, "no"?

1075
00:38:36,283 --> 00:38:38,608
- You're not my boss anymore.
- Well, that may be.

1076
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,644
But I can't have the women
in my life teaming up.

1077
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:41,945
I'll be outnumbered.

1078
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,580
Dad forbid you manage
to have sex with her

1079
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,015
before I do.

1080
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,551
Oh, actually, can I interest
you in another wager?

1081
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:49,719
No. Done deal. Pay up.

1082
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:52,689
(sighs) Fine, the convertible's yours.

1083
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:53,657
I'm over that.

1084
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,525
Well, the hot, new bartender.

1085
00:38:55,535 --> 00:38:56,760
Been there, done that.

1086
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,195
Well, spit it out then, Maze.

1087
00:38:58,205 --> 00:38:59,471
What is it you want?

1088
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,570
I want a drink.

1089
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,205
What, that's it?

1090
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,940
Fine. Pick any bottle, pull two glasses.

1091
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,985
No, I want you to pour <i>me</i> a drink.

1092
00:39:15,722 --> 00:39:16,855
All right.

1093
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:30,193
To newly defined relationships.

1094
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:31,895
Cheers.

1095
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:33,538
(elevator bell dings)

1096
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:38,335
Oh... please...

1097
00:39:38,345 --> 00:39:40,270
don't drink in front of me.

1098
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,405
Bad case of the distractions, brother?

1099
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:44,674
- (chuckles)
- Well, I better go.

1100
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:47,043
MAZE: I'll let you deal
with the lightweight.

1101
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,211
(Amenadiel groans)

1102
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:50,280
Judging from your behavior last night,

1103
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,449
that lunatic dancing,
I fear that my advice

1104
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:54,417
may have created a whole
new set of problems.

1105
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:57,454
No more turning a "blind eye," Lucifer.

1106
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:59,130
(groans) Listen...

1107
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:03,994
We both know that Dad is not the kind

1108
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:05,295
to forgive and forget.

1109
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:08,265
No distraction on earth
is gonna change that.

1110
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,000
I said that I would punish Mom,

1111
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,135
and I'm doing so here on earth.

1112
00:40:12,145 --> 00:40:13,970
Deal maintained, loophole achieved.

1113
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,513
What if He doesn't feel that way?

1114
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,775
There will be real consequences, Luci,

1115
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:20,076
for all of us.

1116
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:22,112
Especially me.

1117
00:40:22,122 --> 00:40:23,647
You know, I liked you better drunk.

1118
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:26,850
Tell me something, brother,
what deal <i>did</i> you make?

1119
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,152
What was worth writing
Father, of all people,

1120
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:30,186
a blank check?

1121
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:32,730
Not a what. A who.

1122
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:43,099
You made a deal for Chloe's <i>life?</i>

1123
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:44,501
Don't look at me like that!

1124
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:46,636
At the time, it made a
certain amount of sense.

1125
00:40:46,646 --> 00:40:47,912
Don't you understand?

1126
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:51,107
You made a deal to return Mom to Hell.

1127
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:53,910
In exchange, Chloe's life was spared.

1128
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,645
Well, that's one interpretation.

1129
00:40:55,655 --> 00:40:57,948
Despite whatever loopholes
you think you found,

1130
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,098
and the lies that you have told yourself,

1131
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:03,086
you still haven't delivered
on your end of the bargain.

1132
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:06,256
Luci, what if Dad decides to

1133
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,525
take back His side of the deal?

1134
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:11,661
(laughs)

1135
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:15,065
One silly human soul?

1136
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:17,968
I can't imagine Dad would
take much interest in that.

1137
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:21,122
CHLOE: <i>Yes, two adult women and a child.</i>

1138
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,540
MAN (over phone): Just bring over a
deposit, and the apartment's yours.

1139
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,676
Really? Oh, yeah, I will, uh...

1140
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:28,511
Great, I'll drop off a check right away.

1141
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,700
- Okay, thank you.
- MAN: Of course.
