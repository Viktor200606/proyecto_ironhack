64

be a cog in a bigger machine.

69
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:12,088

You're not going steady, Maze.

79

00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:38,147

No, I mean, to blame it on me.

160
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,190
It's an atrocity.

161
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:29,959
These Satanists.

You must be destroyed!

172

I'm gonna give you what for

173
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,244
if you don't get out of
my crime scene, pal.

174

No thanks necessary.

178
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,454
Just wanted to do my
part for the man of the hour.

179
00:06:58,522 --> 00:06:59,882
It's the wink with the porn stache

180
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,657
sending the wrong message, I think.

181
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:02,591

Do you two know each other?

183
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,861
Nope, just heard a lot about this guy.

184
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:06,962
All bad, of course.

185

186
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:13,435

00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:16,038
You know, me trying to kill you,

188
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:17,540
the whole magic coin thing.

189
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:18,808
TMI... am I right?

190
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,143
I'd like you to stop touching me now.

191
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:22,578
(laughs)

192
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:24,446
Ah, you're hilarious.

193
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,448
We should get a drink sometime.

194
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:28,617
Yeah, maybe play some pool, huh?

195
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:36,525
Hey, Chloe?

196
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:38,694
If, uh, if we could talk soon,

197
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,329
some stuff went down with Malcolm.

198
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:41,931
I mean, I know now's a bad time...

199
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:44,033
Yeah, it is.

200
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,569
This bruising here around
the stab wounds.

201
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:47,903
DAN: Hilt marks maybe.

202
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:49,205
And these.

203
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,073
There's subdermal implants.

204
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:52,508
They don't look fresh.

205
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:53,709
I don't know what they are.

206
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,578
Symbols? Designs maybe?

207
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,746
Well, not a lot of places do that
kind of body modification.

208
00:07:57,814 --> 00:08:00,382
Malcolm and I will try
to find who put them in.

209
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,684
All right.

210
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:04,320
He and I have to meet Rose's
father at her apartment.

211
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:06,021
Right, where is that exactly?

212
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:09,024
Uh, 1625 Lynrose.

213
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:10,426
Right, I'll see you there.

214
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,094
What? What-what are you doing?

215
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:13,329
I'm gonna take my own ride.

216
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:14,830
You're a wretched driver.

217
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:16,398
Since when?

218
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:20,836
♪ It's colder now than it was ♪

219
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:23,405
♪ Yesterday ♪

220
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:25,674
♪ Warm down south ♪

221
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:27,109
♪ So I'm on my way... ♪

222
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:28,544
I'm so sorry for your loss.

223
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:30,063
Were you close with your daughter?

224
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:30,588
Yes.

225
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:33,415
Well, we were when she was little, but

226
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:35,551
you know, single father
with a teenage daughter...

227
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:38,687
Yes, I'm quite familiar
with the absentee father

228
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:39,822
excuses.

229
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,790
Can you tell us why
Rose marred herself recently

230
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,026
with subdermal implants?
- What?

231
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:45,728
That doesn't sound like Rosie.

232
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:49,365
This bookshelf's been moved a lot.

233
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:56,605
(hinges creaking)

234
00:08:59,342 --> 00:09:01,443
Oh, lovely.

235
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:04,713
Very mid-century rapist.

236
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:08,017
Hello, bad guys?

237
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,733
What is this place?

238
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:28,671
It's a creepy, secret evil room.

239
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,172
You didn't know about this?

240
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,408
No.

241
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:38,180
What's this?

242
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,349
It's a chicken.

243
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,817
Or what's left of it.

244
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:43,752
If that's supposed to
be an offering for me,

245
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,622
then I decline on grounds of salmonella.

246
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:50,759
This picture, th...

247
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:52,962
this isn't Rose.

248
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,532
Mr. Davis, I'm so sorry.

249
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,734
But maybe this wasn't a random attack.

250
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:01,236
Maybe your daughter was
involved with whoever killed her.

251
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,905
It's a large man by the looks of it,

252
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:06,608
who's, uh, not a fan of bathing.

253
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:08,210
MR. DAVIS: This is crazy.

254
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:10,746
I mean, even if she was into
this stupid Devil thing,

255
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:12,748
she wouldn't have sacrificed herself.

256
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:15,217
Yes, but sometimes the people
closest to you can turn on you.

257
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:17,119
Wouldn't you agree, Detective?

258
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:19,655
Maybe.

259
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,993
"For my Corazon.

260
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,793
Love, Rose."

261
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:25,861
"Corazon" is Spanish for heart.

262
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,464
Could be a term of endearment.

263
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,466
Could be a name.

264
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:34,236
MR. DAVIS: I should've reached out.

265
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,605
Called more.

266
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:38,774
I thought I knew her.

267
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:42,911
Oh, yes, I know exactly how you feel.

268
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:44,913
(phone rings)

269
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,784
Decker.

270
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:51,887
We called around, found the
girl that gave Rose her subdermals.

271
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,690
Said she, uh, came in a couple
weeks ago with a guy.

272
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,625
Weird guy, apparently,
with a weird name, too,

273
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:58,227
but she can't remember it.

274
00:10:58,294 --> 00:10:59,828
Ask if the name's Corazon.

275
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:03,165
Hey. Was the guy's name Corazon?

276
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,566
Yeah, that's it.

277
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,769
Uh, jet black hair, lots
of piercings and tattoos.

278
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:09,938
Did you hear that?

279
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:11,206
Yeah, generic Satanist.

280
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:13,642
What about the, uh,
subdermals... she know what they mean?

281
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,676
No.

282
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:16,278
Says Rose brought them in herself.

283
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:18,313
She was super secretive about 'em.

284
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:19,448
Uh-huh.

285
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:21,350
We'll talk soon.

286
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:23,352
- Ah, look at you two.
- (sighs)

287
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,686
Marriage falling apart,

288
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:26,155
trying to work together...

289
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:27,723
So cute.

290
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,458
Yeah, well, maybe if you
hadn't sent her a break-up text

291
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:31,326
- while I was unconscious...
- Oh.

292
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:32,995
Hey, speaking of

293
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:35,531
kicking your ass, I'm
proud of you for bouncing back.

294
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,299
Friends fight, right?

295
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:38,801
Yeah.

296
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:40,602
Dick.

297
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,805
(distant siren wailing)

298
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,842
(alarm chirps)

299
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,646
(growling)

300
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:51,847
(grunts)

301
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:55,084
Why is Lucifer still alive?

302
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:56,018
Oh, it's you.

303
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:57,119
You scared me, dude.

304
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:58,554
Have you forgotten what
will happen to you

305
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:00,022
if you don't comply with our deal?

306
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,025
No, but I forgot to tell you!

307
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:04,960
Lucifer spilled the beans.

308
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:09,498
What are you talking about?

309
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:10,566
All that jazz about

310
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,601
condemning me to eternal damnation?

311
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:14,269
Poppycock, apparently.

312
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:16,071
You're an angel

313
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,807
and Lucifer said that you're
not allowed to kill me.

314
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,709
Plus...

315
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:22,578
I got this beauty right here.

316
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:25,080
It's my get-out-of-Hell-free card.

317
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:27,082
(growls)

318
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:31,153
(sighs)

319
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:32,721
So...

320
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:36,091
unless you got a better offer...

321
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,062
#TeamLucifer.

322
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,364
It's not half bad, this.

323
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,166
I mean, the writing's atrocious,

324
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:45,934
but it's not complete drivel.

325
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,035
Listen to this:

326
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:49,605
"Satan represents a beacon of honesty

327
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:53,075
in a sea of mass self-deceit."

328
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:54,076
Mmm.

329
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:55,277
And... oh. Hello.

330
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:57,168
There's a whole chapter on sex.

331
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:58,522
I like this book.

332
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:01,183
Rose's subdermal implants...

333
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:03,418
I'm pretty sure they're letters.

334
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:06,121
But I've arranged
them 100 different ways

335
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:08,891
and I can't come up with
anything significant.

336
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,327
"Chili furis"?

337
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:16,365
"I hurl ficis"?

338
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,768
No.

339
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:22,504
But could... could
you come over here, please?

340
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:32,548
Oh, bloody hell.

341
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,518
Filii hircus. It's Latin.

342
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:37,619
Means "children of the goat."

343
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:39,555
Why do they always associate
me with goats?

344
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:41,182
I mean, I don't even like their cheese.

345
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:43,625
Here we go.

346
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:45,093
"Church of the Dark Prince."

347
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:49,998
Location is secret.

348
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,501
Looks like you have to be a member.

349
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:55,871
Geez, look at this questionnaire.

350
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:57,506
Oh, and of course,

351
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:59,007
there's a fee.

352
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,609
$200? Sinful.

353
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:03,111
There's got to be a faster way.

354
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,315
LUCIFER: "What is
your gift to the Devil?"

355
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:09,618
CHLOE: How about... filii hircus?

356
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:11,119
Yes!

357
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:12,354
(mumbling to self)

358
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:15,691
All right. Okay... what...

359
00:14:15,758 --> 00:14:17,893
Yeah, I'll see you there!

360
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:20,929
What...?

361
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:23,465
♪ ♪

362
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:34,409
(clears throat)

363
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:38,280
Okay.

364
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:40,349
That's it.

365
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,450
You're being a freak.

366
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:43,719
You've been avoiding me for weeks,

367
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:45,187
you won't get in my car.

368
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:46,421
What's your problem?

369
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:47,456
There's no problem.

370
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:48,924
Just maybe you're not as charming

371
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:51,727
as you think you are.

372
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:54,563
Wait, is this about that
vulnerability thing?

373
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:56,598
Actually, yes.

374
00:14:58,301 --> 00:15:00,836
I mean... I get the teensiest
bit touchy-feely with you

375
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:02,371
and you freak out.

376
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:04,039
Ugh. All I meant that night

377
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:05,707
is that I can trust you.

378
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:08,176
That's all.

379
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,177
Okay?

380
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:10,145
Okay.

381
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,380
Okay.

382
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:12,347
Okay.

383
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:22,090
(clears throat)

384
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:24,593
(whispering) Filii hircus.

385
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:27,763
(sighs)

386
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,997
Habeas corpus?

387
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:30,299
Bababooey?

388
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,434
You had it right the first time.

389
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:34,736
But today is private.

390
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:39,274
Too private for Lucifer himself?

391
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:40,475
You're supposed to be blond.

392
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,278
Yes, I get that a lot.

393
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:45,414
- You have ID?
- Absolutely.

394
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:47,082
Let me just, uh...

395
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,350
Oh. Dearie me.

396
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:49,618
I seem to have left it in the car.

397
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,486
Detective, would you mind
going to fetch it, please?

398
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:53,504
What am I, your dog?

399
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:02,657
Detective...

400
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:04,195
After you.

401
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:15,118
It's very Eyes Wide Shut.

402
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:17,937
Too bad I forgot my sexy mask.

403
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:20,206
Does anything scare you?

404
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:21,474
Should it?

405
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,877
MAN: Rose is gone.

406
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:25,712
But it is not her
death that was important,

407
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,013
it was her life.

408
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,048
The imprint she left behind.

409
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:31,818
See, Rose will be remembered.

410
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:33,920
She will live on forever.

411
00:16:33,988 --> 00:16:36,189
This isn't a sacrifice.

412
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:37,323
It's a memorial.

413
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:38,791
Quite civilized, actually.

414
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,436
Yeah, they don't seem like killers.

415
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:42,319
Mmm.

416
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:43,763
ONYX: And so now

417
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:46,399
it is time to invoke

418
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,701
the Four Crowned Princes of Hell.

419
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,270
Oh. Scratch that.

420
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:52,305
Visualize the blue light

421
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:54,307
filling your entire being.

422
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,910
Satan to the east.

423
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,811
Beelzebub to the north...

424
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,180
This is preposterous.

425
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:02,315
I thought you'd love this.

426
00:17:02,383 --> 00:17:03,750
First of all, there's only one me.

427
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:06,152
And secondly, the whole
worship thing is more my father's bag.

428
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,621
And now...

429
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,558
Lucifer will speak!

430
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,559
What?

431
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:17,096
- (thump)
- Ooh.

432
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:19,132
Oh. No. No, no, no, no, no.

433
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,576
This is where I draw the line.

434
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:21,059
Ow.

435
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:23,536
- Ow.
- Excuse me, excuse me! Sorry.

436
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:24,737
Sorry.

437
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:25,772
MAN: Hey, man.

438
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,373
If you would just butt out.

439
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,174
Right!

440
00:17:28,242 --> 00:17:29,742
I'm the real Lucifer

441
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,979
and I insist that you
stop this nonsense immediately.

442
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:34,407
I mean, have you heard yourselves?

443
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,205
It's embarrassing.

444
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:36,926
Blue light coming out your ass

445
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:37,826
or whatever it was.

446
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:39,986
I mean, you preach rebellion,

447
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:41,721
but you're-you're misguided sheep.

448
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,289
And goat.

449
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:44,958
Where's the real defiance?

450
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,593
- The free will?
- SATANIST: Yeah!

451
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,594
Free will!

452
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:48,695
Free will rules!

453
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:50,063
(applause)

454
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,965
No, no! You're doing it again.

455
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,266
Don't applaud.

456
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:54,867
This whole thing's a sham!

457
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:55,868
(woman whoops)

458
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:57,136
Anarchy!

459
00:17:57,204 --> 00:17:58,137
(cheering, whooping)

460
00:17:58,205 --> 00:17:59,372
I mean, just-just look at this.

461
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,241
What is this supposed to be?

462
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,477
Alien fetus?

463
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:06,112
Pickled demon?

464
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,214
He's the best
Lucifer we've had in years.

465
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:11,284
(chanting) Lucifer! Lucifer!

466
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:13,286
- Lucifer...
- Stop!

467
00:18:14,822 --> 00:18:16,789
Someone killed this girl!

468
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:18,191
She didn't deserve that.

469
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:20,460
This is not what I stand for.

470
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:23,496
Is that what you all wanted? Eh?

471
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:30,370
Should be ashamed of yourselves.

472
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:35,908
LAPD.

473
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:37,610
Put the knife down.

474
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:43,349
Why were you running?

475
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:45,652
I wasn't.

476
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,653
I was upset.

477
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,021
Feeling guilty, are you?

478
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,188
Tell me... why?

479
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:51,691
What, our new Devil's a cop, now, is he?

480
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,459
LUCIFER: Oh, worse
than that, I'm afraid.

481
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:54,427
So come on.

482
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:56,195
Tell me, what nasty little urge

483
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:58,564
are you hiding in your hoodie, hmm?

484
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:02,368
I want to kill...

485
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:03,503
Yeah?

486
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,773
I want to kill the sick
bastard who killed Rose.

487
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,007
And then, after that,

488
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:11,477
I want the hell out of this racket.

489
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:13,713
Oh.

490
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:15,548
What's your name?

491
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:16,649
Onyx.

492
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:17,717
Hmm?

493
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:19,118
(sighs)

494
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,154
Mitch Watson.

495
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:23,089
Yeah, I changed it when
I joined the church.

496
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:26,592
12 years later, I'm the
frickin' high priest.

497
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,593
I'd love to bail.

498
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:29,462
Kind of late for a
career change, though.

499
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,165
I mean, the whole thing's a joke.

500
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:33,666
So, hold on...

501
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:35,802
Are you saying you
don't believe in Lucifer?

502
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:38,438
Look, mate, the Devil ain't
gonna buy me an Aston Martin.

503
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,065
Well, not with that attitude, he won't.

504
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:42,075
I mean, I like the philosophy.

505
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:43,776
But it attracts a lot of weirdoes

506
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,545
who take it way too seriously.

507
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:46,813
And, of course,

508
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,414
now Rosie's dead.

509
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:49,942
Yeah, and I see you have the same

510
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,341
subdermal implants as she did.

511
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:52,652
All the hard core members...

512
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,786
they all get this.

513
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:54,921
I was trying to tell Rosie

514
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:56,356
that she would regret it later,

515
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:58,858
but she became obsessed.

516
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:00,560
She was an impressionable girl.

517
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,161
Well, her father was absentee.

518
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:04,831
I suppose that's why she got
involved in all this nonsense,

519
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:06,232
to piss her dad off.

520
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,201
Actually, it was,
uh... it was her boyfriend,

521
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:10,069
Corazon, he's the
one who brought her in.

522
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:12,038
Man, the guy's a creeper.

523
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,841
He kept talking about
doing real sacrifices on animals.

524
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,111
Did Corazon have access to this knife?

525
00:20:18,178 --> 00:20:20,346
Yeah, probably.

526
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:23,649
This here is just for show.

527
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:26,853
The blade springs inside the handle.

528
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,321
Hmm. Strange.

529
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:30,523
'Cause if it was
real... it could definitely match

530
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,991
the marks found on Rose's body.

531
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:33,726
We do have an actual version.

532
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:34,727
Hold on.

533
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,366
Knife's gone.

534
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:41,868
Okay, we need to find Corazon now.

535
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:42,969
- Yeah.
- Do you have, um,

536
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,237
his real name,

537
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:46,005
uh, where he lives, his address?

538
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:47,373
Give me a sec.

539
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:52,311
Ugh.

540
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:56,616
Looks just like you.

541
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:58,184
I manscape.

542
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:02,955
I'm starting to understand
why you chose this persona.

543
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:04,957
All-powerful...

544
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,092
Invincible...

545
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,527
Not exactly.

546
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:12,965
Ah. Or it's because you think that
everybody's out to get you.

547
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,066
That's because they are.

548
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:15,802
But trust me, I didn't choose it.

549
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:17,870
Why would anyone choose to be vilified?

550
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:20,072
Thought the Devil was
supposed to be immortal.

551
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,275
Well, one angel can hurt another, so...

552
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:29,882
Oh, what...?

553
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:32,819
What are you doing?

554
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,454
(door opens)

555
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:38,020
No address, no last name, nothing.

556
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:39,759
Hmm.

557
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:42,128
He used PayPal to pay for the fee.

558
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:44,430
All right, I'll call in a warrant.

559
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:52,805
Well, if you can't
bring Muhammad to the dim sum...

560
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,914
Hey.

561
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:03,649
Why'd you stand me up?

562
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:05,918
I had one task...

563
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:08,454
one...

564
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:10,790
to get my brother back to Hell.

565
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:17,563
I've not only failed,

566
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:20,399
but I've actually made things worse.

567
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,869
I'm even sleeping with a demon.

568
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:28,274
Yeah, you lucky son of a bitch.

569
00:22:28,342 --> 00:22:32,345
Come on, you can't say

570
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:36,616
that this isn't the
best sex you've ever had.

571
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:39,085
Well, it is the only sex you've
ever had, but still.

572
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:41,087
(chuckles)

573
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:44,891
Look, I've had a lot of sex,

574
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:48,160
with men and women.

575
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:49,896
- I mean a lot.
- Okay.

576
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:51,297
Point made.

577
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:54,834
But this, with you,

578
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:56,302
I don't know, it's...

579
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,838
it's different.

580
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:11,384
But if you're not happy here,

581
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,586
then you should go home.

582
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:16,689
I can't.

583
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:21,027
I can't face my father as a failure.

584
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:23,029
Look, I have a job to do.

585
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:25,264
There's no choice.

586
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:28,367
I understand.

587
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:39,078
<i>CHLOE: Okay. Great.</i>

588
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:40,346
Yeah, I'll be here.

589
00:23:40,414 --> 00:23:41,614
All right.

590
00:23:41,682 --> 00:23:43,683
So we got a real name for Corazon...

591
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,718
Mike Carey... but it
could take us a while to find him,

592
00:23:45,786 --> 00:23:47,187
so you should probably head home.

593
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:47,911
Oh, no, no, no.

594
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:50,089
Not till this human
stain's brought to justice.

595
00:23:50,157 --> 00:23:52,291
(scoffs) I can't get near you,

596
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,026
now I can't get rid of you.

597
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:55,027
Whatever.

598
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:56,295
I'm gonna go up and shower.

599
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:57,964
Stay put. Do not wake up Trixie.

600
00:24:00,701 --> 00:24:02,635
♪ ♪

601
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:09,875
(sighs)

602
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:20,953
Did you just throw a toy at me?

603
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:22,221
Oh, you're awake.

604
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:24,190
But since you're up, I
have some questions for you.

605
00:24:24,257 --> 00:24:25,758
Right.

606
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:27,860
Are you adopted?

607
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:31,030
In other words, are you sure
the detective is your mother?

608
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:32,665
Could she be from somewhere else?

609
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:34,600
Does she have any special powers?

610
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:37,136
Uh-uh. What about any markings?

611
00:24:37,204 --> 00:24:39,939
Scars, on her back perhaps?

612
00:24:40,007 --> 00:24:42,274
There's some chocolate
cake in it for you.

613
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:44,076
I want cash.

614
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:45,578
Oh.

615
00:24:45,646 --> 00:24:48,814
(chuckles) I like your style.

616
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:50,750
All right.

617
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:52,418
Mommy does have a scar.

618
00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:54,420
- Oh?
- On her butt.

619
00:24:54,488 --> 00:24:56,088
From when she got bit.

620
00:24:56,156 --> 00:24:57,556
By the Kraken.

621
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:58,791
Right.

622
00:24:59,826 --> 00:25:01,260
Not the direction I was going for,

623
00:25:01,328 --> 00:25:03,362
but what's this Kraken that you talk of?

624
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,132
CHLOE: My mom's evil Chihuahua.

625
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,400
Why aren't you showering?

626
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:08,868
'Cause I left my phone down here.

627
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:10,136
Why is Trixie awake?

628
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:12,838
- (snaps)
- Get back in bed, young lady.

629
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:13,873
Night, Lucifer.

630
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,842
All right, seriously.

631
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,078
No more freaky behavior.

632
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:21,213
If this is about the
other night, I'm sorry, okay?

633
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:23,056
What do you want me to
do, take it all back?

634
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:25,051
No, can you take your shirt off, please?

635
00:25:25,118 --> 00:25:26,018
What?

636
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,454
Are you serious?

637
00:25:28,522 --> 00:25:29,822
I need to see your back.

638
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,223
Why?

639
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:34,727
Because I want to know if
you're an angel sent to destroy me.

640
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,567
(sighs)

641
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:46,572
Nothing.

642
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,641
Yeah.

643
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:50,710
Is this about the scars on your back?

644
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:54,914
Look, I have no
idea what happened to you

645
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:56,449
or what's going on with you now,

646
00:25:56,516 --> 00:25:59,652
but... not everyone's out to get you.

647
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:02,855
(phone buzzing)

648
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:05,791
They found him... Corazon.

649
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,603
WOMAN: We found his car like this.

650
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:19,805
It's registered to Mike Carey.

651
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:26,612
- (clattering)
- (gasps)

652
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:30,850
(Malcolm chuckles)

653
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,852
Just like old times, huh?

654
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:34,220
Don't shoot me though.

655
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:35,221
Funny.

656
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:36,555
Come on, I'm just joking.

657
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:37,990
(clattering)

658
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,896
Ah, Detective Douche, Detective Stache.

659
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:45,097
What a pleasant surprise.

660
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:46,232
Did you find anything?

661
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:48,100
Place seems empty.

662
00:26:57,477 --> 00:27:00,579
CHLOE (whispering): My God.

663
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:16,753
It's definitely Mike Carey.

664
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:19,889
Detectives, can I show you something?

665
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,527
(siren wailing)

666
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:26,763
So what do you really
make of all this, huh?

667
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:28,965
The "Hail, Lucifer," the pentagram?

668
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:33,737
I think it's a long time
since I encountered genuine evil.

669
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:35,038
Wow.

670
00:27:38,943 --> 00:27:40,410
(sniffing)

671
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:42,345
It's not blood. It's paint.

672
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:46,783
So the killer strapped Mike up

673
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:49,753
then decided to go all Jackson Pollock?

674
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,021
I guess.

675
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,525
Yeah, looks like an "A."

676
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:56,993
That can't be random.

677
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:58,728
I think it's a word.

678
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:11,841
(gasps) Giant anamorphic print.

679
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:13,843
"Morningstar."

680
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:16,212
DAN: Whoa.

681
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,081
Another Satanic message.

682
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:19,449
Or a fan letter.

683
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:21,751
Morningstar is not exactly the
most common name for the Devil.

684
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:24,454
You think someone
did this for our Lucifer?

685
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:25,989
That's kind of a leap, Dan.

686
00:28:26,056 --> 00:28:28,725
Yeah, but if I'm right,
it's also a conflict of interest.

687
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:30,860
Somebody could be
doing this on his behalf,

688
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,595
or maybe he's
involved in a different way.

689
00:28:32,663 --> 00:28:34,397
- What does that mean?
- LUCIFER: Yes.

690
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:36,866
What are you insinuating?

691
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,401
That some psycho might be killing people

692
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:39,936
because of your whole Devil shtick.

693
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:41,504
You're blaming this nonsense on me?

694
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,740
You do take the whole
Satan thing pretty seriously.

695
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:45,675
You really think I'd
do these vile things?

696
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:48,411
These kids were pretending to be bad,

697
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,959
but they weren't, they were innocent,

698
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:51,881
so I would never hurt
them, I'm not a monster.

699
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:52,916
CHLOE: Okay, guys.

700
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,517
That's enough.

701
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,022
Lucifer, maybe you should go home.

702
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:02,492
Oh, no, allow me to stay in
this rusty tin can a little longer.

703
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,261
You came to me, you
insisted I work this case.

704
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,530
Okay, this sounds crazy,

705
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:09,499
but this case might involve you.

706
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:10,834
What do you mean, involve me?

707
00:29:10,901 --> 00:29:11,935
You know what I mean.

708
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,603
- (sighs)
- I'm trying to protect you.

709
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:18,541
Oh, protect me from the
evil or the world from evil me?

710
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:27,484
Can you believe Detective von Douche

711
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:29,252
boots me off the case?

712
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,987
And Chloe agreed to this?

713
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:32,388
(sighs) She didn't disagree.

714
00:29:32,456 --> 00:29:33,756
(chuckles incredulously)

715
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,725
How could she even think I'm capable?

716
00:29:35,793 --> 00:29:36,860
Here?

717
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:39,062
That's why I left.

718
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:40,530
I thought she knew me.

719
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:41,798
I thought I knew her.

720
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:43,466
And now you don't trust her anymore?

721
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:46,936
Oh, it's just this
whole immortality thing.

722
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:49,105
Uh, for some reason,

723
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:51,741
Detective Decker makes me vulnerable.

724
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:54,544
Also known as "intimacy."

725
00:29:54,612 --> 00:29:57,981
No. No, she literally
makes me exsanguinate.

726
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,783
Being vulnerable can be scary.

727
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:04,287
But there are benefits when
you open yourself up to someone.

728
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:06,089
I just wish I knew who was behind this.

729
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:07,223
My dad?

730
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,224
My brother?

731
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:09,559
Someone else?

732
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:11,628
I mean, the
detective doesn't seem to know,

733
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:12,962
but she could be lying.

734
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,497
Is she part of the plan to kill me,

735
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,299
or is she just a-a pawn?

736
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:18,301
Maybe we should explore the possibility

737
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:21,638
that being
vulnerable can be a good thing.

738
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:23,873
No, it can't.

739
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:26,142
It means you're at someone else's mercy.

740
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,845
Then maybe you should
just stay away from everybody.

741
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:30,647
Stay away from Chloe.

742
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:33,616
But...

743
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:35,752
I don't want to.

744
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:38,254
Then don't.

Satan is here, but God is near!

- Satan is here, but God is near!
- You!

766
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:31,641
I know you're behind this.

767
00:31:31,709 --> 00:31:32,841
Because I have seen you.

768
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:34,711
I know what you really are.

769
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:36,045
What I am is annoyed.

770
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:37,780
Just let me go to my club

771
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:38,982
and move along, please.

772
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:41,718
I know these murders are your doing!

773
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:43,252
I have no skeletons in my closet,

774
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,855
which is more than can be
said for you nasty little humans.

775
00:31:45,923 --> 00:31:48,858
So come on, preacher
man, enough about me,

776
00:31:48,926 --> 00:31:51,127
let's talk about your
dark and nasties, shall we?

777
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:54,564
I must throw you into a
lake of sulfur and fire.

778
00:31:54,632 --> 00:31:56,566
Oh, so you want to destroy me.

779
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:58,468
Well, get in line.

780
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:00,737
Yes, I wish...

781
00:32:00,804 --> 00:32:01,604
Yes.

782
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,406
I never met you.

783
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:05,241
It's like some kind of
collective amnesia.

784
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:06,909
I mean, I walk
around this city of yours,

785
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:08,878
solving its filthy little crimes,

786
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:10,413
and this is the thanks I get?

787
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:11,314
You're a murderer.

788
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:12,315
A murderer!

789
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,119
Stop blaming me!

790
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:20,289
I should destroy you.

791
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:22,091
- MAN: Hey, put him down!
- MALCOLM: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

792
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,826
Easy, easy. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

793
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:26,195
This scumbag isn't worth it, all right?

794
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:27,397
This isn't over.

795
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,333
(chuckles)

796
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:32,435
You come to have a go at me as well?

797
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:33,436
Nah.

798
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:34,704
Chloe thought you might need protection

799
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:36,005
from freaks like that.

800
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:38,207
What I want is a drink.

801
00:32:42,146 --> 00:32:43,946
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.

802
00:32:44,014 --> 00:32:45,748
Earlier today, or three weeks ago,

803
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:47,583
when you broke up with me in a text?

804
00:32:47,651 --> 00:32:49,519
Chloe, I know.

805
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:51,654
I've been looking for a
way to explain things,

806
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,890
but nothing makes sense.

807
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:55,858
I will fix this, though, I promise.

808
00:32:55,926 --> 00:32:58,127
No more promises. I
just want to do our jobs.

809
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,630
What's that?

810
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:02,832
(siren wailing)

811
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:09,472
(indistinct radio transmission)

812
00:33:15,946 --> 00:33:17,914
This definitely doesn't belong here.

813
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:20,216
A monogrammed "M."

814
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:22,648
Doesn't Lucifer wear cuff links?

815
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:38,220
Realy? No prints, no skin cells?

816
00:33:38,287 --> 00:33:39,488
Nope. Dead end.

817
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:41,490
Unless you want to check Lucifer's
closet for the match.

818
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:42,524
Very funny.

819
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:44,392
Yo, Decker, your partner's on TV.

820
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,328
NEWSCASTER: A video went viral today

821
00:33:46,395 --> 00:33:48,630
after a fight erupted
on Hollywood Boulevard.

822
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:51,299
Local club owner Lucifer Morningstar

823
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:55,170
attacked Reverend Jacob
Williams when Williams claimed

824
00:33:55,238 --> 00:33:57,172
the businessman with the devilish name

825
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,707
was actually involved

826
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:01,676
in the Satanic murders
making recent headlines.

827
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:03,278
Apparently, I'm not the only one.

828
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:04,346
This is ridiculous.

829
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:05,747
He didn't attack the guy.

830
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:07,649
He was defending himself.

831
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:10,719
Still hot.

832
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,122
Sorry.

833
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:21,363
The preacher.

834
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,731
Preacher's wearing a cuff link.

835
00:34:22,798 --> 00:34:23,899
So what?

836
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,066
A lot of guys do.

837
00:34:25,134 --> 00:34:26,034
One?

838
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:27,602
With an "M"?

839
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,803
DAN: No way.

840
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:30,171
Oh...

841
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,172
It's not an "M."

842
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,909
It's a "W," for Williams.

843
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:35,310
Come on, Dan, it makes sense.

844
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:36,578
Who's gonna want to kill Satanists

845
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,179
more than a religious zealot?

846
00:34:39,982 --> 00:34:41,016
We gotta find him.

847
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,084
MALCOLM: Freakin' street preacher

848
00:34:43,152 --> 00:34:44,753
and his little minions, man.

849
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,855
Who do they think they are?

850
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:49,858
Bunch of posers. (chuckles)

851
00:34:49,926 --> 00:34:50,859
Ah...

852
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:52,327
Don't even sweat it, huh?

853
00:34:52,395 --> 00:34:55,630
What do you say we get some
ladies up in here, huh?

854
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:56,731
Blow off some steam!

855
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:58,466
Emphasis on the "blow," huh?

856
00:34:58,534 --> 00:35:00,468
(chuckling)

857
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,574
Why are you in my house?

858
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:08,577
Because I got your back, man.

859
00:35:08,644 --> 00:35:11,813
I saw the way they
treated you at the crime scene.

860
00:35:11,881 --> 00:35:14,616
Anyways, I know you
didn't kill those people.

861
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:16,084
Did you?

862
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:21,790
(laughing) I'm just joking! God...

863
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:24,626
You need to relax, get
yourself a little shiatsu.

864
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:25,760
Mmm.

865
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:27,629
Ah...

866
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:28,730
This feels good.

867
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:30,999
Feels good, hanging out here with you.

868
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:34,269
I mean, ever since I, you
know, went to Hell, it's just...

869
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:36,938
there's been things in my head

870
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:39,441
that no one would understand.

871
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:42,344
Except you, of course.

872
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:44,379
You know?

873
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:46,114
I just want you to know...

874
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:48,950
I respect the hell out of you.

875
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:50,385
(giggles)

876
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:51,186
Get it?

877
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:52,988
Hell? (laughs)

878
00:35:53,055 --> 00:35:54,422
Up top.

879
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:00,562
What, you just gonna leave me hanging?

880
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,031
You've got red paint on your hand.

881
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:04,265
Huh?

882
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,301
Just like the paint we
found at the warehouse.

883
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,802
I must've gotten it on me at the scene.

884
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,004
Oh, I doubt that.

885
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:11,306
Everyone was wearing gloves.

886
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:19,881
Aw, man!

887
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:21,249
You caught me!

888
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:23,051
Literally red-handed. (laughs)

889
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,053
Oh, I was, I was wondering

890
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:26,888
when you'd figure it out.

891
00:36:26,956 --> 00:36:29,724
You know, when I asked if you did it?

892
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:32,160
Totally thought you were gonna ask me.

893
00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:34,362
Been dying all day to tell you.

894
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,498
You?

895
00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:37,632
Uh-huh.

896
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,600
You did this?

897
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:40,001
You killed those people?

898
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:41,838
Oh, you mean those frauds?

899
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,437
Duh!

900
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:43,985
So, what do you... what do you think?

901
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:45,607
Impressed? Hmm?

902
00:36:45,675 --> 00:36:46,741
You're insane.

903
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,076
I know! It's...

904
00:36:48,144 --> 00:36:49,244
Don't you love it?

905
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:50,578
I mean, of course you do.

906
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:51,713
I mean, we're the same.

907
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:54,249
Oh, we are not the same.

908
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:55,850
Wait, wait, wait.

909
00:36:55,918 --> 00:36:58,319
I-If you're worried,

910
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:02,257
I've got the perfect
person to pin it on:

911
00:37:02,324 --> 00:37:03,792
that street preacher.

912
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:05,060
Genius, right?

913
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:06,327
Guy's crazy. Yeah.

914
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:08,786
And I already dropped
some evidence, so it's...

915
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:10,298
Whoa!

916
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:12,300
But I did this for you.

917
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:13,268
Aren't you happy?

918
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:15,370
Why would I be happy?

919
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:17,539
I'm not evil. I punish evil.

920
00:37:17,606 --> 00:37:18,773
- Yeah, but, but you're, you know...
- The Devil, yes.

921
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,141
And you think you know
who that is, don't you?

922
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:22,043
The whole world does.

923
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:24,412
A torturer, maybe.

924
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,182
An inflictor of just desserts, sure.

925
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:29,684
But a senseless murderer I am not.

926
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:32,454
Perhaps I need to clarify my position.

927
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:33,855
Hey, hold on, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

928
00:37:33,923 --> 00:37:35,523
I've got this, remember?

929
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:36,591
(laughs)

930
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:37,926
Don't worry, Malcolm.

931
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:39,427
I'm not gonna send you to Hell.

932
00:37:39,495 --> 00:37:42,297
I'm going to bring it right to you.

933
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:45,800
And after I'm finished with you,

934
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:47,202
Detective Decker can put you

935
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:48,536
in a cold, dark room

936
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:50,604
so you can think about what
you've done, young man.

937
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,374
Oh...

938
00:37:53,442 --> 00:37:54,442
(both laughing)

939
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:58,413
(whimpering)

940
00:37:58,481 --> 00:37:59,914
Ah!

941
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:02,524
AMENADIEL: Why don't you
pick on someone your own size?

942
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:18,190
After the
monumentally dreadful day I've had,

943
00:38:18,191 --> 00:38:20,098
you decide to drop in now?

944
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:21,400
I'm clearing up your mess, by the way,

945
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:22,534
so if you don't mind.

946
00:38:22,602 --> 00:38:24,536
You sent your demon to seduce me

947
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:25,938
and then kill me.

948
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:27,940
- (Lucifer chuckles)
- AMENADIEL: Yeah.

949
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:30,208
I definitely mind.

950
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:33,211
Right.

951
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:34,079
Wonderful.

952
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:35,447
Now look what you've done.

953
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:37,149
The man you just freed...

954
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:38,617
you know, the one you
raised from the dead...

955
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:39,818
he's murdering humans.

956
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:43,522
And that... that is
on your hands, brother.

957
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:44,890
You're wrong.

958
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,325
It's your fault.

959
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:47,526
Oh...

960
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:49,361
It always has been.

961
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,564
Hate to break it to you, bro...

962
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
(grunts)

963
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:55,867
but this time, I'm fighting back.

964
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:57,302
(grunting)

965
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,671
If only you'd done what
was asked of you,

966
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:00,939
none of this would've happened,

967
00:39:00,974 --> 00:39:02,641
and I'd still be home...

968
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:03,909
(grunts)

969
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,043
where I belong!

970
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:08,046
Heaven? Really?

971
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:09,648
You're sure that's still home, eh?

972
00:39:09,716 --> 00:39:11,450
After everything you've done?

973
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:15,187
Sleeping with a demon.

974
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:18,690
Think Dad might have another
assignment for you.

975
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:21,226
Somewhere, I don't
know, slightly warmer.

976
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:23,462
(yells)

977
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:30,802
Why?

978
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,704
Why did you have to use her?

979
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:35,173
(laughs)

980
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:38,243
Now I get what this
little tantrum's really about.

981
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:40,045
It's about Maze.

982
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:41,613
You like her.

983
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:44,016
Well, I mean, I don't
blame you, brother.

984
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,551
She is a wild woman in the sack.

985
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:53,458
Listen, if you wanted me dead,

986
00:39:53,526 --> 00:39:55,861
you should've had the
balls to do it yourself!

987
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,364
Oh, please.

988
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:02,034
You're the one who's been
using pawns from the start.

989
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:03,568
Linda, Malcolm, huh?

990
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:05,504
Now the detective.

991
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:09,007
You're a coward!
- Chloe?

992
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:11,710
I don't even know
what you're talking about!

993
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,578
You always were a lousy liar.

994
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:21,453
You justify it all, don't you?

995
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,654
Claim it's all done

996
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:24,956
in the name of our father,

997
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:26,825
but...

998
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:29,361
it's for your sake, brother.

999
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,063
And they call me the prideful one.

1000
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,565
Enough!

1001
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,634
I'm the pawn.

1002
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:38,570
You both used me.

1003
00:40:39,073 --> 00:40:41,007
You know what?

1004
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:42,008
Here.

1005
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:45,978
Kill each other.

1006
00:41:00,227 --> 00:41:01,928
(sighs)

1007
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:05,798
Now where do I get a drink?

1008
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:08,234
The last place the
preacher was seen was near LUX.

1009
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:11,337
Remember, he's to be
considered armed and dangerous.

1010
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:12,872
Malcolm took Lucifer into the club.

1011
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,474
You guys see
anything, you get on the radio.

1012
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:15,541
All right, I'll check the club.

1013
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:16,809
You guys search the area.

Everyone's doing it.

1020
00:41:36,763 --> 00:41:39,198
Yeah, your scuffle with the preacher

1021
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:40,766
made the local news.

1022
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:41,767
(laughs)

1023
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:42,969
Oh, that.

1024
00:41:43,036 --> 00:41:45,304
That was about five disasters ago.

Yeah, well, what can I say?

1027
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,343
You should've seen the other chap.

1028
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,777
Thought I did.

1029
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:52,912

(scoffs) Well...

1031
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:56,849
where do I begin?

1032
00:41:56,917 --> 00:42:00,686
With the grandest fall
in the history of time?

1033
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:02,688
Or perhaps the far more agonizing

1034
00:42:02,756 --> 00:42:04,624
punishment that followed?

1035
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:07,293
To be blamed for every

1036
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:10,630
morsel of evil humanity's endured,

00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:13,399

All I ever wanted

1041
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,877
was to be my own man here.

1042
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:27,847
To be judged for my own doing.

1043
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:29,148
And for that?

1044
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:32,552
I've been shown how
truly powerless I am.

1045
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:36,455

Yes?

1051
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,474
(laughing) What?

1052
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,410
Put your hands up and
move away from the bar.

Stop!

1055
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:07,153
Don't say another word.

1056
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,154
Put your hands up.
