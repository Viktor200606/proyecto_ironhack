1
00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:04,484
("Raiders March"
playing on TV)

2
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:10,974
So what'd you think?

3
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:11,975
It was good.

4
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:13,109
That's it?

5
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:14,978
"Good"?

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,247
I enjoyed it.
When you told me

7
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:19,165
I was going to be
"losing my virginity,"

8
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:22,001
I didn't think you meant showing
me <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

9
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:23,453
for the first time.

10
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:26,456
My apologies.
I chose my words poorly.

11
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,258
I should have said
you were about

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,576
to have your world
rocked on my couch.

13
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:35,265
Anyway, thank you
for watching it.

14
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:37,250
It's one of my
all-time favorites.

15
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,435
It was very entertaining...

16
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:41,888
despite the glaring
story problem.

17
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,141
Story problem?!

18
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:47,510
(laughing):
You-- oh, Amy...

19
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,364
What a dewy-eyed
moon-calf you are.

20
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:53,533
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

21
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:56,953
is the love child of Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas,

22
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:59,656
two of the most gifted
filmmakers of our generation.

23
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:02,141
I've watched it 36 times,

24
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:04,877
except for the snake scene
and the face-melting scene,

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,898
which I can only watch when
it's still light out, but...

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,218
I defy you to find
a story problem.

27
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,620
Here's my jaw... drop it.

28
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:17,456
All right.

29
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,592
Indiana Jones
plays no role

30
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:21,094
in the outcome
of the story.

31
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:23,062
If he weren't
in the film,

32
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:25,348
it would turn out
exactly the same.

33
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,851
Oh, I see your confusion.
You don't understand.

34
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:32,822
Indiana Jones was the one
in the hat with the whip.

35
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:36,909
No, I do, and if he
weren't in the movie,

36
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:38,811
the Nazis would have
still found the ark,

37
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:41,864
taken it to the island,
opened it up and all died...

38
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:44,450
just like they did.

39
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:50,923

50
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:23,728
Hey!

51
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,180
Hi! I thought you went

52
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:27,098
to the comic book store
on Wednesdays.

53
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,150
Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy
were having date night

54
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:31,486
and they don't need me
there to make it awkward.

55
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:35,757
They have each other
for that.

56
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,109
So, how was school?

57
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:39,444
Oh, good.
Check it out.

58
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:42,514
The Disappointing Child
by Beverly Hofstadter.

59
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:44,299
(chuckles)

60
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:53,124
You bought my mom's book?

61
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:54,275
Yeah!

62
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:56,511
It's on the recommended
reading list

63
00:02:56,513 --> 00:02:57,796
for my psychology class.

64
00:02:57,798 --> 00:02:59,514
(Leonard groans)

65
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:04,636
Come on.
Not that book.

66
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:06,972
It-It's got, like,
every horrible story

67
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:10,025
from my childhood in it.

68
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:12,243
Oh, cool.
Are there pictures?

69
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,730
Seriously, please find
another book.

70
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:18,733
Oh, come on. Why?
How bad could it be?

71
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:20,869
There-There's chapters
about potty training,

72
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:23,071
and bed-wetting and...

73
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:25,540
masturbation.

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,827
Basically, if something
came out of me,

75
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,412
she wrote about it!

76
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:33,832
You know what?
Do whatever you want,

77
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:36,217
just don't talk
to me about it.

78
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:40,205
Not even the chapter on
the breast-feeding crisis?

79
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:47,228
It was not a crisis.

80
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,097
Apparently, I favored
the left one,

81
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,932
she got a little
lopsided.

82
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:55,386
Oh, my God, you still go left!

83
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:03,161
Which celebrity would you say
I look like the most?

84
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:05,413
Halle Berry.

85
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:07,832
Why?

86
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,801
Stuart and I are putting
dating profiles online,

87
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:11,269
and it's one of the questions.

88
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:15,239
And thank you-- I'd kill
for that woman's bone structure.

89
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:19,461
Why are you reading
Pride and Prejudice?

90
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:20,745
I'll tell you why.

91
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:23,832
Amy ruined <i>Raiders</i>
<i>of the Lost Ark</i> for me,

92
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:25,433
so now I'm trying to find

93
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:27,852
something beloved to her
and ruin that.

94
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:32,107
Because her life wasn't enough?

95
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:34,142
(both giggle)

96
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:37,479
Wait... how can, how can
anyone ruin <i>Raiders?</i>

97
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,530
It's perfect.

98
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:39,781
Yeah, except for the fact

99
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:42,450
that Indiana Jones is completely
irrelevant to the story.

100
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:46,738
With or without him, the Nazis
find the ark, open it and die.

101
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,462
Aw! Aw!
Aw!

102
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:56,498
Hey, wait a minute.

103
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,633
No, the Nazis were digging
in the wrong place.

104
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:00,301
The only reason
they got the ark

105
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:01,836
was because Indy
found it first.

106
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:03,788
Actually, they were
only digging in the wrong place

107
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,056
because Indy had
the medallion.

108
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:06,624
Without him, they would have
had the medallion

109
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,459
and dug in the right place.

110
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,647
Aw! Aw!
Aw!

111
00:05:16,402 --> 00:05:17,802
Okay, I know you don't

112
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:19,187
want to talk about it,

113
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,723
but can I just ask you one
question about your mom's book?

114
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:22,657
No.

115
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,092
I just want to know

116
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:26,427
why a five-year-old boy
puts on his mom's makeup

117
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:29,114
and wears balloon boobies.

118
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:34,285
They weren't boobies,
they were muscles.

119
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:35,537
And the makeup was green.

120
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:37,839
I was pretending
to be The Hulk.

121
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:40,258
You were wearing
her bra.

122
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,960
That was to keep my muscles
from sagging!

123
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,596
Can we please stop talking
about this?!

124
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:46,714
Okay, okay.

125
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:48,049
But you know,
as a student of psychology

126
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:52,220
who got a check-plus on
her first homework assignment...

127
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:54,856
I think, sometimes, it's good
to open up about these things.

128
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:56,024
Okay, fine.

129
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:58,109
Do you want to know why
I dressed like The Hulk?

130
00:05:58,111 --> 00:05:59,811
Because I was always mad
at my mom

131
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:02,213
and I wanted to smash
my way out of that house.

132
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:04,215
Well, why were you so angry?

133
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:06,701
Gee, I don't know.
Maybe it's because

134
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:08,786
I was always the subject
of her little experiments.

135
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:11,656
Did you get to the chapter where
she staged the Easter egg hunt

136
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:14,325
with no eggs to see
how long I'd keep looking?

137
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:18,663
The answer, by the way: June.

138
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:22,383
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
I wish there was something

139
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:24,252
I could do to make you
feel better.

140
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:26,054
I do, too, but there's not.

141
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:28,640
Really?
Are you sure about that?

142
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:34,512
Of course, who am I to argue
with a check-plus student?

143
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:36,514
Mmm...

144
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:37,982
Just warning you--
I'm gonna go right.

145
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:39,884
Don't make a big deal
out of it.

146
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,962
Is makeup really necessary?

147
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:53,364
Well, when someone looks
at your dating profile,

148
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:54,933
the first thing they see
is your picture.

149
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:56,834
I just want to make
sure you look fun

150
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:58,703
and full of life
and not like a body

151
00:06:58,705 --> 00:07:00,371
they just pulled out
of the river.

152
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:05,243
All right,
here we go, and...

153
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,427
smile.

154
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,868
Okay, uh-uh,
that one's in the bank.

155
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,853
How about this?

156
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:18,389
Turn away,
and then turn back into it.

157
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:19,891
But when you do,

158
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:22,877
imagine the camera is the girl
you want to meet.

159
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,862
You got it.

160
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:35,089
Okay, uh,

161
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:37,659
let's try it again.

162
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:40,578
Uh, but this time, pretend
the girl you want to meet

163
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,380
doesn't want to hurt you.

164
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:45,934
I don't think
I can give you that.

165
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:47,719
Come on. One more time.

166
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:59,981
Yeah, it's,
it's a little blurry,

167
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:02,417
but I think that works
in your favor.

168
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:03,735
Do you want a beer?

169
00:08:03,737 --> 00:08:05,253
Sure.

170
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:07,405
Hey, have you finished writing
your profile yet?

171
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:08,906
Almost.

172
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,024
Oh, what did you put

173
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:12,026
as the one-word description
of yourself?

174
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:14,645
I put: unobjectionable.

175
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:17,198
But now that I hear it out loud,

176
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,467
it just seems like
I'm being cocky.

177
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:21,519
What did you put
for your best feature?

178
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:23,171
My parents' money.

179
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:27,125
Uh, what did you put
for your best feature?

180
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:30,044
I put: not applicable.

181
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:32,496
Come on, dude, you're being
too hard on yourself.

182
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,498
You've got a lot
of good stuff going on.

183
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,900
Really? Like what?

184
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:38,536
Well, okay, you're a,
you're a talented artist,

185
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:40,471
you own your own business.

186
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:43,408
Neither of those things have
ever helped me meet a woman.

187
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,128
Okay, well, can we imply

188
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,447
that you're well-endowed?

189
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:53,901
I do have one
oddly long testicle.

190
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,189
Okay, now you're talking
like a winner!

191
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:04,178
Whatcha doin'?

192
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,864
Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>

193
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:09,334
is a flawless masterpiece.

194
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,669
He's got too much pride,

195
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:14,639
she's got too much prejudice--
it just works.

196
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,540
So you're looking
to ruin something for her

197
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:17,759
in the funny pages?

198
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:21,679
Amy has a fondness for
the comic strip <i>Marmaduke.</i>

199
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:24,315
Mm-hmm. And...?

200
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:26,901
And I think I've got it.
Consider:

201
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:30,021
a family possesses a dog
that is so large

202
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:33,724
and poorly disciplined,
he causes nothing but problems.

203
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:36,444
Why do they keep him?!

204
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:39,247
Maybe they fell in love with him
as a puppy

205
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:41,332
and didn't know how big
he was gonna be.

206
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,985
Of course.

207
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:46,170
You know, why couldn't she
just like <i>Ziggy?</i>

208
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:47,238
Yeah?

209
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,357
That thing's riddled
with plot holes.

210
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,794
Sorry, buddy.
Ooh!

211
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:55,880
I think she's a fan
of <i>Garfield</i> as well.

212
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:56,848
(laughs)

213
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,767
Oh, darn it, now so am I.

214
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,085
I'll see you later.

215
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,987
I gotta go watch a stupid
football game with Penny.

216
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:04,689
Wait-- hang on.

217
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:05,973
You've spent time with Amy.

218
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:08,693
Can you think of anything
she's fond of

219
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:12,730
that has a bunch of flaws
she hasn't noticed?

220
00:10:16,568 --> 00:10:18,769
I gotta go.

221
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,392
You ready to go?

222
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:26,577
Yep. Hey, and maybe this time

223
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:29,464
you don't try and talk sports
with the guys.

224
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:31,215
Some sports bar.

225
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:33,384
It's like they never
even heard of Quidditch.

226
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,553
Do we really have to go?

227
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:36,954
Oh, come on.
Every time we're about

228
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:38,573
to hang out with my friends,
you don't want to.

229
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:39,740
It's like, "It's too loud,"

230
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:41,625
or "the bathroom's too dirty,"

231
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:44,228
or "they put a chicken wing
in my ear..." I mean...

232
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,130
Well, you're-you're right.

233
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:47,131
Let's just go.

234
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:48,749
Hey, what's going on with you?

235
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:49,633
Nothing, I'm fine.

236
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,185
All right, hang on.

237
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:52,720
is this still about
your mom's book?

238
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:55,406
No. Not everything is
about my mom.

239
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:56,807
'Cause if you're still
upset about that,

240
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:57,875
we don't have to go.

241
00:10:57,877 --> 00:10:59,827
Except this is
totally about my mom.

242
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:03,030
I'm so sorry.

243
00:11:03,032 --> 00:11:04,315
I never should have
read that book.

244
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:05,750
You know what?
You want to just get dinner

245
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:06,667
and watch the game here?

246
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,837
That sounds nice. Yeah.
Okay.

247
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,789
Or, you know,
we could get take-out

248
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,990
and watch the Blu-ray
extended version

249
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:15,760
of <i>The Hobbit</i> movie
with commentary track.

250
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,749
On account of how sad
I am about my mom.

251
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,467
Leonard, you ready for lunch?

252
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:34,636
LEONARD:
One sec!

253
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:36,588
Hey. Sorry.

254
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,390
(panting)

255
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:40,509
Hi, Penny.

256
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:41,510
Hi.

257
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:42,611
All right, sweetie.

258
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:43,979
You hang in there today.

259
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:45,814
I'll try, but I might
be sad again tonight.

260
00:11:45,816 --> 00:11:47,399
Okay.

261
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,103
Wow!

262
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:53,321
Sex at work?!

263
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:54,356
Leave it alone.

264
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:55,390
That's my girlfriend.

265
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:56,391
Sorry.

266
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:58,677
Who just had sex
with me at work!

267
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,611
(laughing)

268
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:01,463
Damn. How'd you
swing that?

269
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,782
Well, whenever I
talk about how
awful my mom was,

270
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:05,900
Penny will do anything
to make me feel better.

271
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:07,302
Seriously?
Look, I mean...

272
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:10,472
I'm not proud of it,
but it does work.

273
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:11,506
I-I got her to watch

274
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:14,760
a six-part documentary
on <i>Monty Python.</i>

275
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:17,462
Even I was bored,
I just wanted to see

276
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:18,913
if she'd make it
to the end.

277
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:21,183
You sound kind of
proud of it.

278
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:22,084
I am; I'm really proud.

279
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:23,769
(laughs)
Yeah.

280
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:26,571
Hello, Sheldon.

281
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:27,572
Is everything okay?

282
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:28,573
Yes.

283
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,708
Why?

284
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,926
Well, the last time you made

285
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:32,060
an unscheduled video-chat,

286
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:34,129
there was a curly fry
in your regular fries

287
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:37,866
and you thought someone might be
trying to slip you a mickey.

288
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:40,969
April 13...

289
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:43,939
a dark night, indeed.

290
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,640
So what can I do for you?

291
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:47,742
I'm calling to invite you

292
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:50,595
to a spontaneous date night
tomorrow evening.

293
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:51,480
Really?

294
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:52,780
Yes.

295
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:54,049
You were kind enough

296
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:55,967
to watch <i>Raiders of</i>
<i>the Lost Ark</i> with me.

297
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,420
So I'd like to return the favor

298
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:00,288
by inviting you
to watch an episode

299
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,141
of your favorite childhood
television series,

300
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:05,393
<i>Little House on the Prairie.</i>

301
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,464
That sounds lovely.

302
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:11,650
Why are you
rubbing your hands together?

303
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,104
Um...

304
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:17,239
I'm putting on lotion.

305
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:18,740
Are you in or not?

306
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:20,408
Of course I'm in.

307
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,660
Excellent.

308
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:23,578
Then I shall see you tomorrow.

309
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,796
Good night, Dr. Fowler.

310
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:26,348
Good night, Dr. Cooper.

311
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,251
Good night, indeed.

312
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,920
What a rube.

313
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:34,873
Why would I put on lotion
when I have such soft hands?

314
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,993
You were really
quiet during dinner.

315
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:39,961
Is everything okay?

316
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:41,012
Yeah.

317
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:42,881
I guess I was just
thinking about my mom,

318
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:45,166
and how sad
my childhood was.

319
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,354
Yeah, I bet it sucked.

320
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:50,722
I'm gonna take a bath;
you do the dishes.

321
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:53,608
How about I take
a bath with you

322
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,360
and see what happens.

323
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:57,562
Here's what's gonna happen:

324
00:13:57,564 --> 00:13:58,613
I'm gonna take a bath,

325
00:13:58,615 --> 00:13:59,948
and you're gonna do the dishes.

326
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,116
That's it?

327
00:14:01,118 --> 00:14:02,901
No compassion?

328
00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:04,119
Aw, poor Howie.

329
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:05,270
We good?
I'm gonna take a bath.

330
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:07,322
Bernie...

331
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,491
God, what is going on with you?

332
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:11,643
I'm sharing my pain.

333
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:15,881
And I'm not buying it.
Try again.

334
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:20,135
I'm learning to be
a man in a culture

335
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:22,870
where it's increasingly
difficult to know how...?

336
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:25,824
Strike two.

337
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:27,893
I'm copying Leonard.

338
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:29,043
When he does this to Penny,

339
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:31,146
they have sex and
watch <i>Monty Python.</i>

340
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:32,447
Howard!
I know.

341
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:33,348
It was dumb,

342
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,382
I shouldn't
have done it.

343
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:36,902
And it's making
me feel sad...

344
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:39,321
So sad.

345
00:14:41,056 --> 00:14:43,241
You know, why don't
you take a bath? I'll do the dishes.

346
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:50,732
Three, two,
one...

347
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:51,917
That's it.

348
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,686
Our dating profiles are
live on the Internet.

349
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:56,571
Attention all shoppers:

350
00:14:56,573 --> 00:15:00,258
my business is open
for business!

351
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,928
That's right, ladies.

352
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,579
For all you know,

353
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:06,865
I'm confident
and fun to be around.

354
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,767
(chuckles)

355
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:10,018
(computer chimes)

356
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,686
Oh, cool, it tells you

357
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:13,338
when someone's reading
your profile.

358
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,607
"Jenny309."

359
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:19,194
I hope that's not her weight.

360
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:21,613
If it is, I'll...
I'll take her.

361
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:24,849
Good one.

362
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:26,201
(chimes)

363
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:28,653
Ooh, I got one, too.

364
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,922
The ladies are
coming to us.

365
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,709
Oh, man, if I'd started
this years ago,

366
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:37,278
I'd be divorced two
or three times by now.

367
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,913
(chimes)

368
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:40,782
What...? Another one.

369
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:42,784
You know,
it... it's weird.

370
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:44,302
When they're reading
your profile, does it...

371
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:45,971
does it make you
feel exposed?

372
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:48,139
Like they see you naked?

373
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:52,460
Well, they're not running
away screaming, so, no.

374
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:56,564
I love <i>Little House.</i>

375
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:58,950
It made me want to
live on a farm so much

376
00:15:58,952 --> 00:16:00,685
I tried to milk my cat.

377
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,457
That tangy bowl of Cheerios

378
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,908
was not worth the stitches.

379
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:11,196
Well, you sit back, relax

380
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,582
and enjoy a beloved
childhood memory.

381
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:17,719
( <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>
theme music plays)

382
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:21,006
(whispering):
You see that cabin there?

383
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:24,292
I read they were illegally
squatting on Indian land.

384
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:26,261
Yeah.

385
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:28,546
Personally,
I think what we did

386
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,932
to the Native
Americans was wrong,

387
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:33,435
but this is your
favorite show, not mine.

388
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:36,588
Oh, look at little
Laura Ingalls,

389
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,124
eating that
peanut butter sandwich.

390
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:40,675
Peanut butter?!

391
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:43,395
Huh!

392
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:45,680
That's strange,
since peanut butter

393
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:48,683
wasn't introduced
until the early 1900s.

394
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:53,204
If I knew this show
was about time travel,

395
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:56,157
I would have watched it
much sooner.

396
00:16:58,744 --> 00:16:59,911
You're trying to get back at me

397
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:02,063
for what I said about
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

398
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,631
That's silly.

399
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:06,584
Almost as silly as Dr. Baker
having a telephone,

400
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:07,969
since telephones
only existed

401
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:09,704
in large cities
at that time.

402
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:12,507
This is more like
<i>Little House on the Preposterous.</i>

403
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:17,044
Sheldon, we're
in a relationship.

404
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:19,264
When you get angry,
just tell me.

405
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:21,416
You don't need to seek revenge.

406
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:24,119
Are you sure?

407
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:26,738
Every time my dad
stayed out all night,

408
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,358
my mom would put hamster poop
in his chewing tobacco.

409
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,795
Well, that's not how
we're going to do it.

410
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:35,997
Fine.

411
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,282
I'm mad at you.

412
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:39,834
Not only did you ruin
<i>Raiders</i> for me,

413
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,753
you may have ruined
the whole franchise.

414
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:43,788
Except for the fourth one,

415
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,124
which was bad before
you got your mitts on it.

416
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:48,960
I-I shouldn't have said it.

417
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:49,978
I'm sorry.

418
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,913
Thank you.

419
00:17:51,915 --> 00:17:53,281
Do you feel better?

420
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:54,849
Yes.

421
00:17:54,851 --> 00:17:57,385
But not as good as
I'm going to when I tell you

422
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:59,804
that your precious Garfield
has no reason to hate Mondays.

423
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:03,257
He's a cat.
He doesn't have a job.

424
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,483
Hey, I was just--
what is happening?

425
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:14,319
Oh, just a little treat.

426
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:16,070
I know you've been
feeling really bad

427
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:17,522
about your mom lately.

428
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:19,407
Oh, oh, I have.

429
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:20,942
So bad.

430
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:22,911
And I wanted
to make you feel better,

431
00:18:22,913 --> 00:18:25,130
so I planned something
very special for you.

432
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:26,147
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

433
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:29,083
I can already feel it working.

434
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:32,654
Hello, Leonard.

435
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,374
Mom?!

436
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,911
I understand you have been
whining about my parenting

437
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:42,514
in order to emotionally
manipulate your girlfriend.

438
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:44,365
I... uh...

439
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:45,683
Bernadette told me
everything.

440
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:47,819
Now you don't get
the left or the right.

441
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,589
BEVERLY:
Let's discuss

442
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:53,641
why you continue to involve me

443
00:18:53,643 --> 00:18:55,043
in your sex life.

444
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:56,244
Oh, please, Mommy.

445
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:58,830
No, Mommy.

446
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:00,064
When you were six years old,

447
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:03,101
you walked in on me
and your father naked.

448
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:05,737
I was swatting his bottom

449
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:09,040
with your brand
new Ping Pong paddle.

450
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:15,046
I didn't dream that?

451
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,882
How did that make you feel?

452
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:19,551
Penny, come back!

453
00:19:19,553 --> 00:19:22,187
I'm sad for real now!

454
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,056
In the last two hours,

455
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:27,675
162 women have
read our profiles.

456
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:29,394
How many of them have
sent us messages?

457
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:30,862
Combined?
Yes.

458
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:33,064
Zero.

459
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:36,985
Dude, this is...
this is brutal.

460
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:40,154
I don't think I've
ever felt so rejected.

461
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:41,856
And I had a rescue dog

462
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:44,409
who ran back
to the pound.

463
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:48,195
This is the worst.

464
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:49,196
If we're gonna get shot down,

465
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:50,648
we might as well just
go to a bar

466
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,766
and do it old school.

467
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:54,018
And make them
look us in the eye.

468
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,637
Yeah, anything is
better than this.

469
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:57,188
Hello.

470
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,539
Not interested.

471
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:03,344
I was wrong.
This is worse.

472
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,361
("Raiders March" playing on TV)

473
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,616
Wait, wait-- if it wasn't
for Indiana Jones,

474
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,701
the ark would never have
ended up at the warehouse!

475
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:22,620
(gasps)
That's true!

476
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,739
He collected and
delivered the ark

477
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:26,791
to the proper
authorities for filing.

478
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:27,525
Like a hero!

479
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,877
Yeah!
Yes! Right!

480
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,663
Although, technically,

481
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,248
Indy was supposed
to take the ark

482
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,500
to a museum to be studied.

483
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,168
He couldn't even get that done.

484
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:41,042
