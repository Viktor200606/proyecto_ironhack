What's that?

12
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,471
This is my Pentecostal coin.

13
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:25,403

Morningstar, you're under arrest.

Come on, Detective.

32
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:12,187
You can't seriously believe I killed

33
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:13,956
that pathetic malcontent.

34
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,158
It doesn't matter what I believe.

35
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:21,563
That's all that matters, Detective.

36
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,235
Put your hands in the
air and surrender yourself.

37
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:32,241

38
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,645
This isn't funny, Lucifer.

00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,913
Isn't it?

40
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:39,681
(laughs) I think

41
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:43,118
this is the grandest joke that
I've heard in all my time.

42
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:46,221

No.

47
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:56,431
We won't.

All of humanity's sins are
the Devil's fault, right?

51
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,708
I mean, I thought you knew
different, but I was wrong.

52
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:09,011
You're just like all the others.

53
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,412
So,

54
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:13,348
why not add one more murder to the pile?

55
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:14,783
That's not what this is, Lucifer.

56
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:15,884

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,319

guy. Well, here he is,

Newbie.

62
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,127
Come on. Riddle me with bullets,

63
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,529
so you can go home, drink
an ice-cold beer,

64
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,698
and feel better about yourselves!

65
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,533
Don't shoot him. He's unarmed.

66
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,289
Oh, you don't know
that. Maybe I have a gun.

67
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:34,102
Hands in the air!

68
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:34,570
Do it!

69
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:35,105
Don't!

00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:38,941

(sighs)

74
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:51,486
Search the area.

75
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:54,523
He can't have gotten far.

76
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:00,729

77
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,865
(panting)

78
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,702
Can we not tell anyone

79
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:08,804
you just carried me in
your arms like a baby?

80
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,572
What were you trying to
accomplish in there?

81
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,575
Uh, a good death?

82
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,577
Or at least a nice and messy one.

83
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:18,714
But then you had to come and
ruin everything, like always.

84
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,951
(groans)

85
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:25,487
Why'd you swoop in and stop it?

86
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:28,323
Wouldn't let someone else send
me to Hell, is that it?

87
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,793
Well, guess what,
brother, you don't need to kill me,

88
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:35,130
because I'm done here.

89
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:37,399
I've had my fun on Earth, and...

90
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,234
(sighs)

91
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,803
there's no reason for
me to stay anymore.

92
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,672
You win.

93
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:45,307
I'll go willingly.

94
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:47,476
Please, just...

95
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:49,444
take me back to Hell.

96
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,979
No.

97
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:52,814
(sighs)

98
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,251
(camera shutter clicking)

99
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,693
Hey. What happened to Lucifer?

100
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,695
You didn't hear?

101
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,397
What happened to him?

102
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:10,265
He disappeared. He's on the run.

103
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:11,933
OFFICER: Ow.

104
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:16,371
Let me see that.

105
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:18,440
Have you ever seen a knife like this?

106
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:21,310
Yeah. Uh, I'll take it to the station.

107
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,445
Careful. It's crazy sharp.

108
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,422
Great.

109
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:35,057
Hey.

110
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:36,158
I need to talk to you.

111
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,429
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

112
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,763
especially after what just happened,

113
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,999
but I think Lucifer is innocent.

114
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,601
Chloe, Lucifer got into
a fight with the deceased

115
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:48,237
just a couple hours ago. We both saw it.

116
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:49,604
I know. Just hear me out.

117
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,040
Okay? Just pretend you
don't know Lucifer.

118
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:54,076
- I already like it.
- Our suspect

119
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:56,445
is a club owner who likes to
tell people he's the Devil.

120
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,979
You're not really selling his innocence.

121
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:01,249
He's a man who embraces
desire, lives by his passion.

122
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:04,052
Now think about the
body. The guy was executed,

123
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:05,587
single bullet to the head.

124
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:08,056
There's no passion behind this.

125
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:10,058
- This isn't him.
- Then it's a frame job.

126
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:11,159
Who would want to set him up?

127
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,261
- I don't know.
- OFFICER 2: Detective,

128
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:14,896
we may have found the murder weapon.

129
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:17,432
Okay. Test it for prints and DNA.

130
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:19,634
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks.

131
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:23,839
Lucifer's prints are
gonna be on that gun.

132
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,507
- You don't know that.
- I do.

133
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,376
And I also know you're right.

134
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,877
Lucifer's innocent.

135
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,712
What?

136
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,215
Chloe, we have to talk.

137
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,350
Somewhere else.

138
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:39,921
You don't want to take me back to Hell?

139
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:43,625
The one bloody thing you've
wanted this entire time.

140
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,427
(chuckles) Did I punch you

141
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,661
in the head too hard?

142
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:48,730
Maze was right, Luci.

143
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,631
We used her.

144
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,733
And Malcolm. People have died

145
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:52,634
because of us.

146
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,069
Because of you, you mean.

147
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,104
Yes. Because of me.

148
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,139
Right.

149
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,977
Brother, somehow I lost
sight of the bigger picture,

150
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,578
of the cost of my actions,

151
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:06,114
and just how truly selfish they were.

152
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,483
But, Luci, my eyes are wide open now,

153
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,419
and I need to make this right.

154
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,987
Do you know, I think this
side of you's actually scarier

155
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,021
than the angry one.

156
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:14,623
I need to find Malcolm,

157
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,591
and I need to send him back to Hell.

158
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,862
Will you help me, brother?

159
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,232
(sighs)

160
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:27,469
One last bit of
punishment on the way out.

161
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:29,037
(thunder rumbles)

162
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,840
It sounds like fun to me.

Ah, there's nothing like a
fresh shirt after a rainy rooftop.

165
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:48,106
What is that smell?

166
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,676
(groans) Tropical musk candles.

167
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:54,079
Gosh, the sacrifices you
made pretending to be a therapist.

168
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,147
Yeah, I like that scent.

169
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,815
- Of course you do.
- Okay,

170
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,684
can we please just focus?

171
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,364
Now, what's your plan to find Malcolm?

172
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:01,153
My plan?

173
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,427
- Yeah.
- Well, I thought you were

174
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:03,789
the expert at plotting murder.

175
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,258
Or not so expert, considering
I'm still alive.

176
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,593
Which is why I brought us here,

177
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:08,994
so that we could come up with a plan.

178
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,495
Right. Well, it sounds
more like you want me

179
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,565
to do all the heavy
lifting. So how's this? Step one,

180
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,901
travel back in time and
not make such a mess of things.

181
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,769
You know, I'm suddenly
reminded of why I wanted you dead

182
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:18,837
in the first place.

183
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,322
Luci, what is your problem?

184
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,407
Oh, good question,
Doctor. Well, you see,

185
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,611
the thing is that my
brother has been trying to kill me

186
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,145
and now he wants to work with me

187
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,280
but we can't seem to get along,

188
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,915
mainly because he's an egotistical twit.

189
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:30,916
Hello?

190
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,251
Oh, I'm sorry,

191
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,620
Dr. Canaan. I didn't
realize that you were in session

192
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,188
with a... Lucifer?

193
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,657
(scoffing) Oh.

194
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,325
I can't believe this.

195
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,494
You're stealing my patient.

196
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,163
Uh, not exactly.

197
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,533
Actually, you may be just what
we need, my dear doctor.

198
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,440
I deserve that.

199
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:56,875
You lied to me.

200
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,343
I don't even know you.

201
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,279
You shot a man in cold blood.

202
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,913
I shot Malcolm to protect you.

203
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,550
Everything I saw at
Palmetto, it was all true!

204
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,452
You let them think I was crazy.

205
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,521
- I never intended...
- You let me think I was crazy.

206
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,689
I'm sorry.

207
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,824
You don't get to be sorry.

208
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,300
If I could take it all back, I would.

209
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,827
You can't take it back!

210
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,929
I know.

211
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,300
But you can make this right.

212
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,169
How?

213
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,238
Prove Lucifer is innocent.

214
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,374
Where are you going?

215
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,376
Lucifer thinks I abandoned him.

216
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,512
I need to find him.

217
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,717
LINDA: So you're-you're brothers?

218
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,719
Unfortunately.

219
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,816
LUCIFER: And we're having a terrible
time working together.

220
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:45,057
But because you've been so
helpful with me, Linda,

221
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,825
hopefully you can help fix our problems.

222
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,727
Listen, I know this must be a shock...

223
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:49,995
Are you even a real doctor?

224
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,997
(laughing) No, of course he isn't.

225
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,466
Gosh, if he had any
clue about human nature,

226
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,500
we wouldn't be in this mess.

227
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,769
Oh. You dare criticize me?

228
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,171
Luci, you're arrogant,

229
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,060
you're selfish, all you do is

230
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:00,972
- think with your penis...
- Oh.

231
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,974
LUCIFER: Oh. Which, of
course, you would never do, would you?

232
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,109
How's Maze, by the way?

233
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,877
Dr. Martin, will you please
tell him to shut up

234
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,045
and just listen to reason?

235
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,281
Oh, if by reason, you
mean a deceptive load

236
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,349
- of bull...
- Enough!

237
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,553
You lied to me about being a doctor

238
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,121
so you could manipulate Lucifer,

239
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,889
who is actually

240
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,424
your brother.

241
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,759
Somehow.

242
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,994
Do you realize

243
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,030
the ethical position you've put me in?

244
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,031
(chuckles)

245
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,999
And you, let me guess,

246
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,167
you were gonna make a sexual joke

247
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:30,369
about putting me in a position.

248
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,371
That's true, yeah.

249
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,306
Because everything's a joke to you.

250
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,242
And yet, for some
reason, I take you seriously,

251
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:41,246
even when you insist on
clinging to these ridiculous metaphors...

252
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,482
Heaven, Hell, angels, devils.

253
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,750
- Actually, they're not...
- Trust me,

254
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,951
you don't want to pick that fight.

255
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,586
You claimed you came to L.A.

256
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,187
to reinvent yourself, yet every time

257
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:52,691
I think you come upon a
moment of realization,

258
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,494
you go the exact
wrong direction with it.

259
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,562
I did... Ho-Hold on. You're
right. I did come to L.A.

260
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,030
to start a new life, didn't I?

261
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,900
And now Malcolm's on the run.

262
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,295
He's gonna need to
start a new life, too.

263
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:06,638
- No, see, you're doing it again.
- LUCIFER: New I.D.,

264
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:07,873
bank account, passport.

265
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,609
I know just the person to go to.

266
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,411
Oh.

267
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,479
Damn, you're good.

268
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:16,081
- Yep.
- (door shuts)

269
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,187
(Chloe clears throat)

270
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,527
Where's Lucifer?

271
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,097
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

272
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,302
You've never liked me.

273
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,670
Why?

274
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,839
Because every day was a party.

275
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,675
Every sin, every desire L.A. offered,

276
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,844
we took part.

277
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:49,214
And then he met you.

278
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,783
So you think it's my
fault that the party's over?

279
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,687
That and the fact that
you're hunting him down like a dog.

280
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,124
I don't think he killed the preacher.

281
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,993
I need you to help me find
him before another cop does.

282
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,795
So where would he go?

283
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,564
- You know him better than anyone.
- These days

284
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,399
it seems you know him better than I do.

285
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,402
So where do you think he's going?

286
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,738
To get punishment.

287
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,808
Which means he's going after Malcolm.

288
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,344
Then maybe he hasn't
changed that much after all.

289
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,746
If he gets to Malcolm first,

290
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,949
he really will go down for murder.

291
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,423
You can't come with me.

292
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,025
You said you needed my
help finding him, right?

293
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,428
I don't see anybody else backing you up.

294
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:48,206
Byron was a nice guy, a handy guy.

295
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,175
He fixed my toaster once.

296
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,111
Not a BLT goes by I
don't think of Byron.

297
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,946
LUCIFER: Excuse me!

298
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,182
Yeah, sorry to
interrupt the riveting eulogy,

299
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,017
but I'm here to see
the funeral director.

300
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,253
Hello, Neil. Remember me?

301
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,420
In a bit of a rush,

302
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,922
unfortunately.

303
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,392
Whereas this poor chap, well,
he's not going anywhere, is he?

304
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,362
Sir, please wait until
after we're finished.

305
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,863
This is disrespectful.

306
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,266
Uh, no, this is disrespectful.

307
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,835
I mean, this whole
show... who's it for, really?

308
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,270
Eh? Not him.

309
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,438
He's not hearing any of this.

310
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,240
Would you back me up, please, bro?

311
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,042
He is right.

312
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,011
See? Trust me, he should know.

313
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,479
No, it's for you, isn't it?

314
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,847
It's a selfish way

315
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,383
for you to all feel better about
yourselves about how much

316
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,019
you ignored this poor sod in life.

317
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,588
Oh, did you choose this suit?

318
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,290
Mr. Morningstar, this way.

319
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,025
Oh, you do remember me?

320
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,980
Feel free to carry on.

321
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:45,530
You have no right disrupting
this funeral.

322
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:46,634
- This is my business.
- Yes.

323
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,012
Your least profitable one.

324
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:50,502
Your main source of income
is creating new identities,

325
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,571
which is why I came to
you five years ago to get

326
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,806
my proper papers and all that.

327
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,907
And I did great work
for you, Mr. Morningstar.

328
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,610
- So why are you doing this?
- Well, if I know you're the best,

329
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,245
then Malcolm Graham does, as well.

330
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,713
(sighs) The cop.

331
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,583
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he needed it to be done fast,

332
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,985
but said he'd need time to
get his hands on the 100K.

333
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,621
Where would a homicide
detective get that kind of money quickly?

334
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,122
Mm, look at you, Sherlock.

335
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,592
(sighs) He mentioned an old associate.

336
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:14,993
Tommy, I think.

337
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,628
Great. We'll do a search

338
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,229
for every "Tommy" in Los Angeles.

339
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,598
What's another thousand years?

340
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,133
No, no, no, no. An old
associate of Malcolm's, you say?

341
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,236
I think I might know just
the person who can help us.

342
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,005
Rhymes with "douche."

343
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,807
Thanks, Neil.

344
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,946
I wish I had my knives.

345
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,081
You're not gonna need 'em.

346
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,249
I never need them.

347
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,954
LAPD! Malcolm, if...

348
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,327
Oh.

349
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:50,428
Hello?

350
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,964
Anyone here?

351
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,200
(scoffs)

352
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,335
Looks like Malcolm likes to shop.

353
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,604
You cops must make a lot of money.

354
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,473
You hiring?

355
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,375
We're not, and we don't.

356
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,111
I have no idea how he
can afford all this stuff.

357
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,247
Well, if you don't make good
money, why do you do this job?

358
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,448
'Cause I get to shoot people,

359
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,164
which is something you
should keep in mind.

360
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,720
(laughs) No really. Why?

361
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:18,790
'Cause I hate it when people
get away with things they shouldn't.

362
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,925
And you like to shoot people.

363
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,360
Yeah.

364
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,295
Huh.

365
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,565
And to think I almost killed
you in your sleep that one time.

366
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:28,700
Wait. What?

367
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:29,734
(door creaks open)

368
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,903
(gun clicking)

369
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,372
(gunshot)

370
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:35,774
(panting)

371
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:39,277
Oh, now I know why he
likes working with you.

372
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:51,776
Malcolm, it's the police!

373
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:53,778
Stop firing and put the gun down!

374
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:55,747
WOMAN: He's not with you?

375
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:00,718
Please tell me he's not with you.

376
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,793
Sorry. I thought you were my husband.

377
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:10,862
Mel, why were you shooting at Malcolm?

378
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:12,497
Ever since he almost died, he...

379
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:15,266
he's been different, he's been strange.

380
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:16,868
I can't describe it.

381
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:18,536
He has a newfound appetite.

382
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:20,305
An insatiable hunger

383
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,973
he just can't seem to fill.

384
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,241
How do you know?

385
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:24,809
I've seen it before.

386
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:25,944
Where?

387
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:28,346
Right. I forgot who I was talking to.

388
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:29,681
It only gets worse.

389
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:30,782
It can't get worse!

390
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,317
He spent all our money.

391
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:33,952
And when I saw him today, he...

392
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,420
Wait. When did he come by today?

393
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:37,221
You just missed him.

394
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:39,857
He was frantic. He was
looking for money, and he was angry.

395
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:41,225
He was so angry.

396
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:43,962
And he had this look in his
eye, and he said things like...

397
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:46,464
Do you have any idea where
he might have gone?

398
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:48,232
(scoffs)

399
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:50,001
He said he was gonna go get a beer.

400
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,769
- (phone buzzing)
- Okay.

401
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:54,639
Thanks. Excuse me.

402
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:56,441
Malcolm's good, Chloe.

403
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:58,977
I can't find any
evidence tying him to the murders.

404
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:00,278
How's it going on your end?

405
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:02,447
Malcolm's not home. Mel
said he went out for a beer.

406
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:03,762
Does that make any sense to you?

407
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:05,383
No. When I saw him, he was scared.

408
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:07,151
I think he knows Lucifer's
gonna come after him.

409
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:08,987
He looked like a guy
getting ready to run.

410
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:10,622
Yeah, well, he doesn't
have the money to get far.

411
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:12,690
Yeah, but he's the kind of
guy who'd know how to find it.

412
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:14,892
Oh, maybe there's a
bar that owes him money.

413
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:17,528
Yeah, or one that he could
rob for some extra cash.

414
00:16:17,564 --> 00:16:19,864
I'll look into it.

415
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:26,971
(door squeaks open and shut)

416
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,707
Don't move, or wobbly head gets it.

417
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,209
How did you get in here?

418
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:32,677
There's a manhunt for you.

419
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,245
And this is the last
place you'd look, isn't it?

420
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,440
I thought it was quite clever.

421
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:36,514
Ooh.

422
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:38,383
You need to get the hell out of here.

423
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:40,138
Oh, we're gonna need some
information first.

424
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:41,686
- Who are you?
- LUCIFER: Not this again.

425
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:44,188
He's my brother. I
know, shocking, isn't it?

426
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:45,757
He's much less handsome than I am.

427
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,358
AMENADIEL: We're
looking for Malcolm, Detective.

428
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:49,594
Now, we've been told that he's
seeing an associate named Tommy?

429
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:53,031
There are a lot of Tommys in...

430
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,367
A beer. Of course.

431
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:58,670
We'd very much like to
know what you just realized.

432
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:00,171
Too bad. I'm not telling you.

433
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:02,707
(laughs) But you want
to, though, don't you?

434
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:04,842
No, I don't.

435
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:08,379
Oh, you're a complicated
one. That is a surprise.

436
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:11,749
So, come on, what do you
want to do, Daniel? Hmm?

437
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:13,885
I...

438
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:16,621
I want to redeem myself.

439
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:19,991
Oh. And taking down
Malcolm would do that, wouldn't it?

440
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:21,793
So where is he?

441
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:23,027
Come on, you can tell us.

442
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:24,862
Like you said, we're
surrounded by police.

443
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:27,165
There's an old brewery on Third.

444
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,599
Mm-hmm.

445
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:31,102
A drug dealer named Tommy Campolongo
works out of there.

446
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,738
Ah. Not that complicated after all.

447
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:36,908
So you two will stay in
a holding cell while I...

448
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:39,277
(whooshing)

449
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:47,185
Okay. Tommy Campolongo.

450
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,554
That makes sense, that
he'd have cash on him.

451
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:51,756
But he's not gonna hand it over nicely.

452
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:52,951
I'm leaving the precinct now.

453
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,625
Okay, meet me there with
backup. I'm not far.

454
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:56,794
Chloe, don't go...

455
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:59,397
Damn it.

456
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,936
MAN: You like that?

457
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:07,205
(laughing)

458
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,908
And to think, after all this time,

459
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:12,744
I just thought you were dead.

460
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,812
What can I say?

461
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:16,948
It's hard to keep a good man down.

462
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:19,283
- Mm-hmm.
- And now

463
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,219
I'm ready to get the
old band back together.

464
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:23,354
You have some product you can move?

465
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:24,989
We've got some seizures

466
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:26,457
just sitting there in evidence.

467
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:30,795
Could actually get you a
supply today if you've got cash.

468
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,797
I always have cash, Malcolm.

469
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:34,132
You know that.

470
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,100
That I do, Tommy.

471
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:38,136
That I do.

472
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,871
How much you thinking?

473
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:41,139
How much you got?

474
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:43,608
(laughing)

475
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:45,309
(imitating laughter)

476
00:18:45,345 --> 00:18:47,678
(clattering)

477
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:51,282
What's going on up there?

478
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:56,921
This ain't me.

479
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:00,158
What you waiting for?!

480
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:07,965
But hey.

481
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:11,335
Gift horse and all that... am I right?

482
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:16,340
Why don't you go ahead, open
up that safe, my man?

483
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:22,947
Oh...

484
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:24,749
hello there.

485
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,450
If you miscreants don't mind,

486
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:28,152
we're looking for Malcolm Graham.

487
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:29,687
Hand him over, and we
all can be on our way

488
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:31,355
without too much fuss.

489
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:33,624
You two made a huge
mistake walking in here.

490
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,426
(guns clicking)

491
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,228
(stammers)

492
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:41,232
What do you say we skip the
time-slowing shenanigans, hmm?

493
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,334
What about your mortality situation?

494
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:45,469
Well, it's kind of a non-sitch
when the detective's not around.

495
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:47,138
I'll explain later, but for now,

496
00:19:47,173 --> 00:19:50,274
we'll just, you know, enjoy the moment.

497
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:57,949
(chuckles) After you.

498
00:19:57,984 --> 00:19:59,483
Lovely.

499
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,053
Right, I should warn you...

500
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:03,855
(grunts)

501
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,458
(sighs) This is hardly a fair fight.

502
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:08,693
d Hey, hey... d

503
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:11,596
(gunshots)

504
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,734
d Hey, hey now d

505
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:19,437

506
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:23,441

507
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:26,777
d Hey, hey, there's a fire
and it's running, coming in here d

508
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:28,880
(grunting)

509
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:32,083

512
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,123
Sorry, bro. Genuine mistake.

513
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:41,959
d Yeah, hey, hey
now, burning out of luck d

514
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:43,995

515
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:48,799
d Hey, hey now, things
are burning up... d

516
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:49,767
(gun clicks)

517
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:51,102
Oh, do you need some help with that?

518
00:20:51,137 --> 00:20:52,737
d Things are burning up... d

519
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,071
(screams)

520
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:55,940
d Oh, oh, oh. d

521
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,475
(both laugh)

522
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,277
And to think, we
wasted all that millennia

523
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:00,978
fighting each other, right?

524
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,315
We still need to find Malcolm.

525
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,549
Absolutely.

526
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:08,219
You know, if we split
up, we'll cover more ground.

527
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:09,754
Okay, but no hogging all the fun

528
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:12,156
if you find him first... deal?

529
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,224
Deal.

530
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:14,659
(man groaning)

531
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:16,494
Oh!

532
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:19,230
(grunts)

533
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:40,284
d d

534
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,299
(groaning)

535
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:57,802
Wow. I mean,

536
00:21:57,837 --> 00:22:00,805
wow. I could tell it
was something special,

537
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,041
but I had no idea that was gonna work.

538
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:05,810
(moaning)

539
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:08,346
But you never know until you try.

540
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:10,681
(groaning)

541
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:12,183
Got to say,

542
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:15,653
you don't look so scary now, Amenadude.

543
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:20,091
Oi!

544
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:22,893
What part of "no
hogging" don't you understand?

545
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:25,863
(groans, panting)

546
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:35,740
(sighs) Bloody hell!

547
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:36,907
There you go, spoiling

548
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:38,743
my fun again.

549
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:41,345
Leave me, and go get him.

550
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,280
You know how much I hate
being in anyone's debt.

551
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:46,350
I figure if I save you
now, that makes us even, right?

552
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:48,419
Besides, it's...

553
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:50,054
it's just a flesh wound.

554
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:52,056
Hardly can see what
you're whining about.

555
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:54,558
(panting)

556
00:22:55,495 --> 00:22:57,361
What happened?

557
00:22:57,397 --> 00:23:00,364
He was struck with a
blade not of this world, Maze.

558
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:03,734
One of mine.

559
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,935
Yes.

560
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:06,470
I'll handle this.

561
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:07,571
How?

562
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,007
Find him.

563
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:14,578
With pleasure.

564
00:23:23,456 --> 00:23:25,589
(clattering)

565
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:28,859
Malcolm, freeze!

566
00:23:30,663 --> 00:23:32,163
Stop!

567
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:33,464
(gunshots)

568
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:36,267
(panting)

569
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:58,689
(gun clicks)

570
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:00,157
Don't move.

571
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:09,433
Easy, Detective.

572
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:11,568
You're a hard man to find.

573
00:24:11,603 --> 00:24:14,104
Look, I know you think I'm a bad guy,

574
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:16,606
but I'm simply trying to
catch our dear friend Malcolm

575
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:18,493
so I can tear his arms and legs off.

576
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:22,345
- This has nothing to do with you.
- You know I can't let you do that.

577
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:25,148
(sighs) You don't know what he's done.

578
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:27,084
You'd never believe me anyway.

579
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,419
But all you need to know is
that he's here to get money

580
00:24:29,455 --> 00:24:32,122
and then he's gonna disappear. For good.

581
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,891
You mean this money?

582
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:38,462
I'm not here to arrest you, Lucifer.

583
00:24:38,497 --> 00:24:39,996
I know you're innocent.

584
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:41,698
I always have.

585
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:44,935
So let's catch this bastard together

586
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,937
and put an end to all this.

587
00:24:49,508 --> 00:24:53,210
Ah. Look at us,
reunited, and it feels so good.

588
00:24:53,245 --> 00:24:55,912
Malcolm won't get far without
his getaway cash.

589
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:57,314
Where's Maze?

590
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:58,749
She's taking care
of something important.

591
00:24:58,774 --> 00:25:01,752
Oh, of course your ninja
bartender is off on a secret mission.

592
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:03,019
Why, Detective, are you pining

593
00:25:03,055 --> 00:25:05,222
- for some good cop/demon copop action?
- No.

594
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:06,914
I just want to clear
your name and find Malcolm.

595
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:07,624
No, no, no, no, no.

596
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,259
Who cares about the Devil's rap sheet?

597
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:10,861
Why don't we just skip that part

598
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:12,596
and go straight to the main course?

599
00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:15,400
Because it's incredibly impulsive
and shortsighted.

600
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:16,833
Have you noticed that's my jam?

601
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:18,435
If we fix your reputation,

602
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,437
we'll preserve everything we've done.

603
00:25:20,472 --> 00:25:21,872
You want to keep working with me.

604
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:24,441
- And to do that, you need to trust me.
- (door opens)

605
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:26,610
- (sighs)
- (indistinct police transmission)

606
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:32,816
- Okay. Well.
- Right. Very well, Detective.

607
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:35,152
I'm in your hands. But how you intend

608
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:36,953
to prove my innocence is beyond me.

609
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:39,189
Put your hands down.

610
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:40,824
We found the evidence we need.

611
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:42,225
LUCIFER: He did?

612
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,860
Can I rethink my surrender?

613
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:44,961
What'd you find?

614
00:25:44,997 --> 00:25:48,131
It's better if I show you.

615
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:51,701
(indistinct chatter)

616
00:25:51,737 --> 00:25:53,904
d d

617
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:55,005
(moans)

618
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,408
(groans) Enough,

619
00:25:58,443 --> 00:25:59,709
Mazikeen.

620
00:25:59,745 --> 00:26:01,745
I've made my peace with death,

621
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,780
whether I go to Heaven or Hell.

622
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:05,248
I know exactly where you're going.

623
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:08,418
Nowhere. You're staying right here.

624
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:10,187
Now shut up and let me help you.

625
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:15,058
(gasps) There's nothing

626
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:17,093
that you can do.

627
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:20,297
It would take something
divine to heal me.

628
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:27,270
d I'm Hollywood... d

629
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,003
You took that from Lucifer?

630
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,608
I kept it a secret.

631
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:35,278
I thought I could use
it to get us back home.

632
00:26:35,314 --> 00:26:37,714
And you'd give that to me?

633
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:40,617
Believe me,

634
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:42,552
I don't understand this either.

635
00:26:42,588 --> 00:26:44,287
d We'll always be together d

636
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:48,291
d Forever, forever d

637
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:49,693
d Forever d

638
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,195
d Forever d

639
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:55,532
d Forever, forever d

640
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,601
d Forever. d

641
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:06,676
(sighs) Why do I feel like
I'm walking death row?

642
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,845
Should I order my final
meal now to save time?

643
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:11,047
Dan says he has it handled.

644
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,282
You do, right?

645
00:27:12,317 --> 00:27:15,418
I do.

646
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:18,788
I'm here to turn myself in.

647
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:20,857
What are you doing?

648
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:24,494
I removed a firearm
from Evidence lockup,

649
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:26,363
and I gave it to
Detective Malcolm Graham.

650
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:28,064
I believe Detective Graham

651
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,166
then used that weapon to
shoot and kill Jacob Williams,

652
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:31,935
the crime that...

653
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,771
Mr. Morningstar is suspected of.

654
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:36,439
Well,

655
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:38,475
Detective Espinoza,

656
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,876
I...

657
00:27:39,912 --> 00:27:41,912
didn't know you had the stones.

658
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:44,981
No more Detective Douche?

659
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:46,950
Well, not today, at least.

660
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:48,451
Let's go.

661
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:50,553
Dan...

662
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:56,526
(phone buzzing)

663
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:58,929
(sighs)

664
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,833
I need to take this.

665
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:06,803
Hey, honey. Everything okay?

666
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:09,005
MALCOLM: Hello, Decker.

667
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,341
Malcolm?

668
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:12,809
How's the precinct?

669
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:17,314
I still have a few
buddies at the stations.

670
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:20,350
Oh, and I made a new friend today, too.

671
00:28:20,385 --> 00:28:23,687
Pulled her out of a boring
class for some bonding time.

672
00:28:23,722 --> 00:28:25,855
Here, say hi.

673
00:28:26,725 --> 00:28:29,025
Hi, Mommy.

674
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:36,435
Hey, Trixie.

675
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,378
Are you okay, honey?

676
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:39,413
Mommy's here.

677
00:28:39,448 --> 00:28:42,049
Uh, that's enough of that.

678
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:44,451
(sighs) What do you want, Malcolm?

679
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:47,120
Aw. Poor Chloe Decker.

680
00:28:47,156 --> 00:28:48,722
Did someone take something from you,

681
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:50,324
something valuable?

682
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,925
Hurts, don't it?

683
00:28:52,795 --> 00:28:54,328
You want your money.

684
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:55,829
Bull's-eye.

685
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:58,565
Now, don't even think about talking
to the cops. Remember,

686
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:00,467
- you don't know who's with me.
- Okay.

687
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:02,736
And keep Lucifer out of this.

688
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:04,905
Just you...

689
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,673
or she dies.

690
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:13,981
d d

691
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:18,318
d You're an unusual suspect
now and may be right d

692
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:21,588

693

d Where the person you
are after is the other guy... d

695
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:33,333
Hey. Um, I need the
duffel bag we seized today.

696
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:34,501
Where is it? (clears throat)

697
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:35,802
We were just about to
take it to Evidence.

698
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:37,771
Okay. I need to examine it.

699
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:39,339
Sure.

700
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:41,508
LUCIFER: Ah,

701
00:29:41,544 --> 00:29:43,677
there you are.

702
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,345
Is everything all right, Detective?

703
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:46,680
Yeah.

704
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:48,015
Of course.

705
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,816
I'll be right back.

706
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:51,518
Right.

707
00:29:51,554 --> 00:29:55,856
d Well, I'm a rough
detective on a glory ride d

708
00:29:55,891 --> 00:30:00,093

709

- (siren whooping)

711
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:05,399
(with American accent) Detective Decker,

712
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:07,434
step away from your vehicle.

713
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:09,503
Put your hands in the air

714
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:12,272
and walk towards me peacefully.

715
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:14,207
If you do not...

716
00:30:14,243 --> 00:30:16,176
I repeat... if you do not,

717
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:18,779
we will have no choice but to shoot you

718
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:21,114
with our new bazooka.

719
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,217
We've actually been waiting months
and months to use it, so,

720
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:26,320
on second thought, please, speed away.

721
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:27,654
What are you doing?

722
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,890
Well, I could ask you the s...

723
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:29,923
(feedback squeals)

724
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:32,492
(normally) I could
ask you the same thing.

725
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:35,028
You going somewhere without me, hmm?

726
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:36,824
Right after all this
talk about trusting you,

727
00:30:36,832 --> 00:30:38,298
you're immediately keeping secrets?

728
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,400
I don't have time to
explain to you. Something came up.

729
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:43,089
Something that obviously requires
quite a bit of cash.

730
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,204
I didn't know you had
it in you, Detective.

731
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,243
- It isn't for me.
- Oh, you're gonna make

732
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:46,273
it rain at the local strip clubs then?

733
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:48,775
- Lucifer...
- Or perhaps that phone call earlier

734
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:50,877
wasn't as innocuous as
you made it out to be.

735
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:53,547
Fine. You leave me no choice.

736
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:57,651
Malcolm has Trixie.

737
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:00,721
Oh.

738
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:03,690
If I get him his
money, he'll let her go.

739
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:05,792
Right. Because if
Malcolm's established anything,

740
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:07,094
it's his trustworthiness.

741
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:08,395
What choice do I have?

742
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,330
To ride shotgun with
the Devil, for starters.

743
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:11,298
If Malcolm sees you,

744
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,399
he'll kill her. I'm sorry,

745
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:14,134
but I can't risk
it... her life's at stake.

746
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:15,048
Right. So you're just gonna get

747
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,069
both of you killed then, are you?

748
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:17,871
He needs this money to leave town.

749
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:20,107
I won't give it to him until she's safe.

750
00:31:20,142 --> 00:31:21,241
And what about your safety?

751
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:22,743
Trixie is all that matters.

752
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:23,800
- Detective, I...
- I don't have

753
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:25,105
time to argue with you, Lucifer.

754
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:29,116
I realize how bad this can
go, but I don't have a choice.

755
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:31,284
This is my daughter.

756
00:31:33,122 --> 00:31:35,722
Promise me you'll let me go alone.

757
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:37,791
Fine.

758
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:39,326
You have my word.

759
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:41,461
(sighs)

760
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:55,909
Don't look so sad.

761
00:31:55,944 --> 00:31:57,744
Your mommy's coming to pick you up.

762
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,680
Good. I don't like you.

763
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:01,615
What's not to like?

764
00:32:02,484 --> 00:32:04,885
(grunts)

765
00:32:06,922 --> 00:32:09,089
- Trixie.
- All right, easy, Decker.

766
00:32:09,124 --> 00:32:10,524
Easy.

767
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,726
Mommy, can we go home now?

768
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:15,095
Yes, Monkey. (sniffles) We can.

769
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,798
Glad to see you came alone.

770
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,600
Now toss the gun.

771
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:27,107
(panting)

772
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:29,810
Now the other one.

773
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:38,418
There. You happy?

774
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:40,420
Yeah, once I get my money, sure.

775
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:42,355
So, where is it?

776
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:44,391
Not without Trixie.

777
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:47,294
- Oh, come on, Decker...
- Malcolm, that's the deal.

778
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:52,799
Go on.

779
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:57,804
Hi.

780
00:32:58,774 --> 00:32:59,773
Okay, listen to me.

781
00:32:59,808 --> 00:33:01,908
We're gonna play a game, all right?

782
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:04,745
I need you to hide until
I can come find you.

783
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,379
Mommy, I don't want to play a game.

784
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:07,748
- I know you don't, baby.
- (imitates gunshot)

785
00:33:07,783 --> 00:33:11,651
But I need you to go hide
really, really well, okay?

786
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:14,488
Go.

787
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:17,357
(chuckles) Kids, huh?

788
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,196
(sighs, coughs)

789
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:27,000
It's there. It's-it's all there.

790
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,201
It's in the bag.

791
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,537
Yeah. I believe you.

792
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:34,641
You don't need to do this, Malcolm.

793
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:38,044
I know, but I was
gonna shoot you at Palmetto,

794
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,615
and now I feel like I've
been given a second chance here,

795
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,851
so I'm sure as hell not gonna waste it.

796
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:57,828
LUCIFER: Is this really what you did

797
00:33:57,863 --> 00:34:00,731
with your second chance?

798
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:02,266
Deary me, Malcolm. Pathetic.

799
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,467
Hey, Lucifer.

800
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:06,003
Hey, buddy. Long time no frame.

801
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:08,472
Though that didn't stick
too well, did it?

802
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:11,008
Guess I need to find a
more permanent solution.

803
00:34:11,043 --> 00:34:13,844
Give me the gun, Malcolm.

804
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:16,513
Why? Not afraid of you.

805
00:34:16,548 --> 00:34:18,148
All you're doing is
getting yourself killed.

806
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:19,416
And for what?

807
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:21,485
To buy your precious detective
some more time?

808
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,453
No.

809
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:25,222
No, I want to ask you a question.

810
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:27,324
Oh. (chuckles softly)

811
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:32,462
What do you desire, Malcolm?

812
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:37,034
(whispering): Lucifer,
what are you doing?

813
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:40,103
What do you yearn for in that...

814
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,005
rotten soul of yours?

815
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,841
I...

816
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:46,910
You've been given a
second chance, Malcolm.

817
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,378
Is killing Detective Decker

818
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:50,080
really what you want to do with it?

819
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:53,250
I don't.

820
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,218
No, of course you don't.

821
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:57,454
You want to live, don't you?

822
00:34:59,525 --> 00:35:00,891
I do.

823
00:35:02,294 --> 00:35:04,394
More than almost anything.

824
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,496
Almost?

825
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:09,032
(gunshot)

826
00:35:10,135 --> 00:35:12,269
(gasping)

827
00:35:19,678 --> 00:35:21,211
There's one more thing.

828
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:38,312
You feel that?

829
00:35:40,816 --> 00:35:42,650
That's what it's like to die, my man.

830
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:44,652
I know, 'cause I've done it.

831
00:35:46,088 --> 00:35:49,690
And what I want, more than anything...

832
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:55,296
is for you to feel that pain.

833
00:35:55,331 --> 00:35:56,797
To go through what I did.

834
00:35:58,968 --> 00:36:01,602
Because we both know
where you're going to.

835
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:09,209
Bet you never expected

836
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:10,711
to miss this thing so soon.

837
00:36:12,281 --> 00:36:13,514
Yeah.

838
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:15,316
Don't worry.

839
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:17,151
You won't be going alone.

840
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:20,821
I'll be sending Decker
along right behind you.

841
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,224
Oh, Chloe...

842
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:28,562
Oh, Decker...

843
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:30,731
(coughing)

844
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:42,810
Here, Chloe, Chloe, Chloe.

845
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:44,578
<i>LUCIFER: I don't know if this is all</i>

846
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:46,747
part of the plan.

847
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:49,850
Or if You can even hear me.

848
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:56,056
But if You're up there...

849
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:57,925
Dad...

850
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,126
(laughs)

851
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:02,463
I need a favor.

852
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:04,631
(Lucifer gasping)

853
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:07,534
<i>I'll be the son.</i>

854
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,837
<i>You always wanted me to be.</i>

855
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:11,905
(Lucifer choking)

856
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:14,408
I'll do as You ask. (heartbeat
echoing slowly)

857
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:16,677
Go where You want me to.

858
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,112
I...

859
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,583
In exchange,

860
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:27,254
all I ask is...

861
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:30,357
is that you protect Chloe.

862
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:31,692
(heartbeat stops)

863
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:38,298
(ethereal choral music plays)

864
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:57,518
(echoing) Home, sweet home.

865
00:37:57,553 --> 00:37:59,787
d d

866
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:14,601
That can't be right.

867
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:19,807
(clinking)

868
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:29,917
It's open.

869
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:31,952
(low rumbling)

870
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,027
This isn't possible.

871
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:42,963
(gasps)

872
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:45,132
(panting)

873
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:55,843
(chuckles)

874
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:14,361
Hello, Malkie.

875
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:34,181
It doesn't matter.

876
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:35,883
(snorting, choking)

877
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,217
I've got your coin.

878
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:38,719
Oh.

879
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:40,888
I'll be back.

880
00:39:47,062 --> 00:39:49,029
You're looking for this?

881
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:50,731
How...?

882
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,900
I know a guy.

883
00:39:54,403 --> 00:39:56,870
Apparently, He wants me back here.

884
00:40:05,414 --> 00:40:07,514
(sighs)

885
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:12,186
Sorry, pal.

886
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,222
One use only.

887
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:31,438
CHLOE: Trixie!

888
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:33,907
Come out, honey!

889
00:40:33,943 --> 00:40:35,576
Mommy, is it over?

890
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:37,811
Yeah, baby, it's over. Come here.

891
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:41,014
Hi.

892
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,818
Oh, I'm so happy you're okay.

893
00:40:44,853 --> 00:40:47,020
Excuse me if I don't join the group hug.

894
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,193
(whispering) I thought he killed you.

895
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:54,261
Oh, he did.

896
00:40:54,296 --> 00:40:55,429
Yes.

897
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:58,865
I got better.

898
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:01,101
Hmm.

899
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:03,136
You promised you'd let me go alone.

900
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:04,471
True.

901
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:06,707
But I didn't say
anything about following.

902
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,544
What's wrong?

903
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,313
(sighs)

904
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,681
Isn't it past her bedtime?

905
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:22,256
Hmm?

906
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,625
(footsteps approaching)

907
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,793
(Lucifer sighs)

908
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:29,930
(broken glass clinking)

909
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,673
LUCIFER: Ah!

910
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,842
Sleeping on the job?

911
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:44,532
Luci, we still have to find Malcolm...

912
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:45,812
Malcolm, yes.

913
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:47,881
That's dealt with. It's
old news, really.

914
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:52,686
(grunts)

915
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:55,956
(sighs)

916
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:57,090
Where's Maze?

917
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:59,226
Well, I was gonna ask
you the same question.

918
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:01,295
Perhaps your snoring drove her away.

919
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,429
(chuckles)

920
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:07,134
(sighs)

921
00:42:07,169 --> 00:42:08,568
I spoke to Dad.

922
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:10,337
Excuse me?

923
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:13,707
Yeah. I offered Him my
services in exchange f...

924
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:16,710
Well, that doesn't really matter.

925
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,578
He accepted.

926
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:22,983
He replied to you.

927
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:24,184
Mmm.

928
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,053
Well, not in words.

929
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:27,387
But His message was clear.

930
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:29,256
And what does Father want?

931
00:42:30,626 --> 00:42:32,192
Someone's escaped from Hell.

932
00:42:34,129 --> 00:42:36,263
Must've seen a window of opportunity

933
00:42:36,298 --> 00:42:38,198
whilst you were incapacitated.

934
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:39,666
I think He wants me to bring

935
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:41,068
our jailbird back.

936
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:42,836
That's it?

937
00:42:42,871 --> 00:42:44,471
Well, it shouldn't be too hard

938
00:42:44,506 --> 00:42:46,640
to track down a single errant soul.

939
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:48,175
(chuckles)

940
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,344
(fingernails clinking glass)

941
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,182
You're afraid.

942
00:42:57,252 --> 00:42:58,885
Mmm.

943
00:42:58,921 --> 00:43:00,387
Damn right I am.

944
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:02,622
Right, but you're never afraid.

945
00:43:02,658 --> 00:43:04,858
Who could possibly scare you, brother?

946
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,497
Lucifer...

947
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:13,533
Who escaped Hell?

948
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:19,572
Mum.
