2
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:13,048
Sheldon, it's not a great time!

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,516
What do you want?

4
00:00:14,518 --> 00:00:17,752
Hello to you, too.

5
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:20,522
I'm sorry,
but this is important.

6
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:22,157
What is it?

7
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:23,725
<i>Back to the Future II</i> was

8
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:26,628
in the <i>Back to the Future III</i>
case...

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,097
and <i>Back to the Future III</i>
was-- get this--

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,267
in the <i>Back to the Future II</i>
case.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,244
So?

12
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:39,382
So, did you do that, or am I
in the house with an intruder?

13
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:42,469
Sheldon, I got to go inside.

14
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:45,305
It's getting rough out here.

15
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:49,392
You're dodging the question;
I knew it was you.

16
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:54,331
What was that?

17
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,849
What was what?

18
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:57,267
This isn't
a very good connection,

19
00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:00,403
but it sounded like someone
just released a kraken.

20
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:05,408
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

21
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,110
You know there's
no such thing as a...

22
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:12,666
No...!

23
00:01:12,668 --> 00:01:15,452
Penny... Penny...

24
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:17,203
Penny...!

25
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:19,622
What's the matter?

26
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:22,658
Um... well, I was worried

27
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,161
that you might be
missing Leonard.

28
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:28,932
And that might be causing
you to have bad dreams,

29
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:32,185
like the kind you'd get if you
watched <i>Clash of the Titans</i>

30
00:01:32,187 --> 00:01:34,437
right before you went to bed.

31
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,108
Sweetie, did <i>you</i> have
a bad dream?

32
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:40,560
To be honest, I did.

33
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:41,511
Aw.

34
00:01:41,513 --> 00:01:42,645
<i>Back to the Future II</i> was

35
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:45,865
in the <i>Back to the</i>
<i>Future III</i> case.

36
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:47,984
Leonard did it.

37
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:48,952
Good night.

38
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:50,437
No, wait.

39
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,239
Perhaps I should sleep here

40
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:56,059
so you don't miss
Leonard as much,

41
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:59,295
uh, 'cause you're being
kind of a baby about it.

42
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:06,252
You know what?
That would make me feel better.

43
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:08,138
Thank you.
You're welcome.

44
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:14,260

I think you'd be

00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:48,451
that this morning in
the parking garage,

57
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:50,269
I saw this oil
stain on the ground

58
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:53,473
that was shaped just like
my ex-girlfriend, Lucy,

59
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,558
and I didn't get upset at all.

60
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,210
I'm proud of you.

61
00:02:57,212 --> 00:03:00,997
Well, you should be,
'cause she was looking good.

62
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:04,334
Dear Lord!
You're an astronomer.

63
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:06,219
Although you may
have earthly woes,

64
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,538
get your mind back
on the stars.

65
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,789
Gee, even the lowly
dung beetle

66
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,159
chooses to plot its course
by using the Milky Way.

67
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:14,327
Is that true?

68
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:17,130
Everything I say is true.

69
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:18,098
Now, of course,

70
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,466
the dung beetle also enjoys

71
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:21,484
eating feces, living in feces

72
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:23,803
and making little
balls out of feces.

73
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:27,524
So pick and choose which
aspects of its lifestyle

74
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:29,492
you want to embrace.

75
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,995
Come on,
you can talk to girls now.

76
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:34,147
It shouldn't be hard for you
to meet someone new.

77
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:35,331
How can I meet someone new

78
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,051
when everywhere I look,
I see Lucy's face?

79
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:39,786
Tell me you don't see her smile

80
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:43,156
in the crust
of this chicken pot pie.

81
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:45,008
Oh, will you stop it!

82
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,580
Now, listen to me.

83
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:51,714
There's a welcome party

84
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:52,916
for incoming post-docs tonight.

85
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:54,517
Go to it and meet someone

86
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,770
who isn't made of grease or pie.

87
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:01,107
You think you're so cool
because your wife is a person?

88
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,278
Look,

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,180
Bernie's at a neuroscience
conference with Amy--

90
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:08,565
I'll go with you.

91
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:09,716
You would do that for me?
Of course.

92
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:10,950
You're my friend.

93
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,318
I want you to be happy.

94
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,204
Thanks. Oh, Sheldon,

95
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:15,738
since Amy's out of town,
would you like to join us?

96
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,441
I want you to be happy, too,

97
00:04:18,443 --> 00:04:21,744
but not enough
to do anything about it.

98
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:26,199
Howie, stop.

99
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,300
I can't talk like that.

100
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:30,003
Amy's right here.

101
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:32,172
Sheldon, stop.
For the last time,

102
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:35,391
I will not bring home bed bugs.

103
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:36,542
The hotel's nice.

104
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:38,261
There's a pool, a gym--

105
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:39,879
the bar looks like fun.

106
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:43,766
Because I looked in the bed,
and there are no bugs.

107
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:45,068
Aw, I love you, too.

108
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,386
If I don't talk to you
before you go to sleep,

109
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,355
I'll meet you in dreamland.

110
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,607
Good night.

111
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:53,910
No, I will not consider sleeping
in my garment bag.

112
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:01,034
Penny, did you ever wonder
how Starfleet captains...

113
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:03,219
No.

114
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,257
Well, now that I've piqued
your interest,

115
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,210
welcome to the exciting world
of 3D chess.

116
00:05:10,212 --> 00:05:12,128
Why don't you just admit

117
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,346
you only want to play this game

118
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:14,764
because you always
play it with Leonard

119
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:15,882
and you miss him?

120
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:19,435
You overestimate
his significance in my life.

121
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:20,687
Oh...

122
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,805
Do I miss
how he makes a face

123
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:25,091
on my toaster waffle
with syrup?

124
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:26,676
No.

125
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:28,978
Do I miss the way

126
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,898
he fixes the zipper on my jacket
when it gets stuck?

127
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,983
I don't think so.

128
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:36,035
Do I miss how
we say "good night"

129
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:38,488
to each other through the walls
of our bedroom

130
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,856
using Morse code?

131
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,129
Okay, I get it, I get it.

132
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:47,997
You are an emotionless robot.

133
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:50,400
Well, I try.

134
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:53,036
All right, let's just get
this stupid game over with.

135
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:54,270
Great. I'll go first.
Okay.

136
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:56,422
By the way,
how are you with zippers?

137
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,111
Why?

138
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:58,726
Well, I really need
to go to the bathroom,

139
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:01,477
and this one's gone
all cattywampus.

140
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:07,150
Wow, your work on
jellyfish neural nets

141
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:08,501
sounds so interesting.

142
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:09,686
It is.

143
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:12,488
You can download my paper
off the university server.

144
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,657
I will. You can
download my paper

145
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,527
on the Van Allen Belts from the
university server as well.

146
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:19,279
I will.

147
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:22,448
All right.

148
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:38,181
How'd it go?

149
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,333
Well, if you like dry,
factual statements

150
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,435
interspersed with painful
moments of silence,

151
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,354
it was bananas.

152
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,623
Check it out.

153
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,691
Mrs. Davis from Human
Resources is here.

154
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:51,344
She's probably on the lookout
for sexual harassment.

155
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:52,595
Oh, great.

156
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:55,514
There go my chances
of being sexually harassed.

157
00:06:55,516 --> 00:07:00,286
I heard her husband left her
for a hot, young undergrad.

158
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:03,072
That's so much better
than the old, ugly ones.

159
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,245
Mr. Wolowitz,

160
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:10,296
Dr. Koothrappali.

161
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:11,714
Mrs. Davis,
nice to see you.

162
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:15,368
You know, I recently read
a fascinating article

163
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,071
on infidelity among penguins.

164
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:20,673
Okay.

165
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:23,309
So if the fact
that your husband left you

166
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:25,211
makes you feel unattractive,
just remember,

167
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:28,247
penguins get cheated on,
and they're adorable.

168
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,830
It was better when you
couldn't talk to women.

169
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,167
I was thinking of going
to the lecture

170
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,069
on posterior cingulate
cortex lesions

171
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:52,338
in the formation
of autobiographical memory.

172
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,290
Oh, brain lesions
are fascinating.

173
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:57,377
Unless they're yours,
then they're a drag.

174
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,912
To the advancement of science.

175
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:03,015
And to the sick and dying
who make it possible.

176
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:07,270
This is fun; we never
really get to talk shop

177
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:08,304
with Penny around.

178
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:10,056
We usually just end up
talking about boys.

179
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:12,358
Which is fine,
but it's nice to mix it up

180
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,260
with a little intellectual
conversation.

181
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:16,879
From the two gentlemen
at the bar.

182
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,481
Oh, my gosh, boys
bought us drinks!

183
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:21,150
Boys bought us drinks!

184
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:23,019
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

185
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:26,122
Be cool.
You be cool!

186
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:29,208
Guys are hitting on us, and
not just to get to Penny.

187
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:31,961
You're right.

188
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:33,413
Thank you.

189
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,203
Ooh! Bad move.

190
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:42,371
Really? Why?

191
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,591
My queen can now take your rook
from below.

192
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:47,677
So that means I lose, right?

193
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,312
It's over!

194
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:52,715
If I make this move...

195
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:56,235
but I won't because we're having
too much fun.

196
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,906
Okay, let's take a break.

197
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:02,825
We're all out of alcohol.

198
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:04,460
I wasn't going to get alcohol.

199
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:12,702
Gosh, I wonder what
Leonard's doing right now.

200
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:15,004
I miss him so much.

201
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:16,655
Well, if you'd like,

202
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,040
we could call him.

203
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:20,243
I-I mean that
you could call him.

204
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:21,544
As I've explained,

205
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,679
the absence of my friends
does not cause me pain.

206
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:25,932
As rock and roll bad boy,
Paul Simon, once said,

207
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,016
"I am a rock.

208
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:29,268
I am an i-i-i-island."

209
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,238
I'm calling him.

210
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,106
Oh, goodie!
Put him on speakerphone!

211
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:43,866
Excuse me, ladies,

212
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:45,485
but my pants are buzzing.

213
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:50,356
North Sea, how can I "kelp" you?

214
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:53,409
Leonard?

215
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:54,544
Penny?

216
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:55,661
Hey, it's Penny.

217
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:56,862
Everybody say hi to Penny.

218
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,548
Hi, Penny!

219
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,268
Wow, it sounds like
you're having a good time.

220
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,154
Best time of my life!

221
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:09,909
Isn't it 5:30
in the morning there?

222
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:11,043
Is it?

223
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,763
Hey, everybody,
it's 5:30 in the morning!

224
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,316
Uh...

225
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,202
okay, well,
we were just calling you

226
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:20,719
because we were missing you.

227
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:21,938
Iceberg!

228
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,022
Uh-oh, hang on.

229
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,657
Are you in danger?

230
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,192
No, it's a drinking game.

231
00:10:26,194 --> 00:10:28,227
Whenever we see an iceberg,
we take a shot!

232
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:30,279
Berg! Berg!

233
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,698
Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg--

234
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,700
Leonard, Leonard?

235
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,540
I cannot believe we were
missing that jerk.

236
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:43,359
<i>You</i> were.

237
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:53,933
So what happened?
How'd it go?

238
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:56,335
It's fine. I thanked them again
and let them know

239
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:57,269
we're not available.

240
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,421
So I can drink this
without having

241
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:01,357
to give up the goodies?

242
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,474
Yes, it's all cool.

243
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:05,377
Although, if you wanted
to talk to one of them,

244
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:06,695
no one would blame you.

245
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:09,481
And why would no one
blame me?

246
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:13,769
I don't know
what I'm saying.

247
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,288
Well, it sounds
like you're saying

248
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,040
that I could do better
than Sheldon.

249
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,409
Boy, these drinks are strong!

250
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:26,065
Hoo, mama, I'm gonna be gginhu !

251
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:29,251
No, tell me,
I want to know

252
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,836
what you meant by that.

253
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:35,341
I just meant
that you're not married

254
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:37,259
and your boyfriend's kind of...

255
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,228
Sheldon.

256
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,264
And your husband
is extremely Howard.

257
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,733
What's your point?

258
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:47,653
Sorry.
I have no point.

259
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,137
That was a stupid thing
to say.

260
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,523
Can we please just go back
to having a nice time?

261
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:54,827
We could, but unfortunately
my brain is lesion-free

262
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:56,695
and I remember that
rotten thing

263
00:11:56,697 --> 00:11:58,948
you just said about
my sweet baboo.

264
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,115
Come on. I apologize.

265
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:02,084
Can we please
just let it go?

266
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:05,287
Sure.
Thanks.

267
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,992
Your husband's weird
and his clothes are ridiculous.

268
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:13,479
I can't believe it!

269
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:14,913
All this time
I've been doing nothing

270
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:16,482
but sit around
and miss that guy.

271
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:18,133
And you know what
the worst part is?

272
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:19,668
That you're having to process

273
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,770
your emotional pain
without vodka?

274
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:28,694
No.

275
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,779
Yes.

276
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:34,683
But you know what
the second-worst part is?

277
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:36,235
He does not miss me at all.

278
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:39,138
Allow me to comfort you.

279
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,308
At least you've got your health.

280
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,929
Really? Tha-That's it?
That's comforting?

281
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:51,000
Um, uh, in a hundred years,

282
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:53,986
you'll both be dead
and it won't matter?

283
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:56,138
No! Come on!

284
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,924
You're supposed to say,
"Of course he misses you.

285
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:01,877
The only reason he's partying is
to cover up his pain."

286
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,530
Oh, no, I don't think
that's true at all.

287
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,434
This is ridiculous.

288
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:10,936
Why am I upset just because
he's off having a good time?

289
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:15,157
Well... perhaps you're
obsessively picturing him

290
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,495
engaged in drunken coitus
with another woman.

291
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:25,517
Is that it?
Did I get it right?

292
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:28,120
Okay, tha-that's great.

293
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:30,406
You can stop trying to make me
feel better now.

294
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:33,175
Actually, I can't.
Before Leonard left,

295
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:35,661
he made me promise
that I'd take care of you.

296
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:38,047
He did?
Yes.

297
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:40,833
Oh, that's really sweet.

298
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:42,518
Plus, if I do a good job,

299
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,371
he said he'd bring me back
a sailor's cap.

300
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:49,191
Now I miss him even more.

301
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:53,779
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm sure Leonard's tormented

302
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:59,234
every moment he's away from your
warm embrace and cherry lips.

303
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,670
Thanks.

304
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,539
Oh, seriously?

305
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:08,577
Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?

306
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:09,878
What?

307
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,915
I'd like to apologize
for being insensitive.

308
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:16,635
And for possibly making penguins
seem like jerks,

309
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:20,139
'cause 99% of them
are stand-up guys.

310
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:22,174
Forget about it.

311
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,695
You know, you-you and I,
you and I have a lot in common.

312
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:28,113
Is that right?

313
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:29,815
Oh, yes, I-I, too,

314
00:14:29,817 --> 00:14:32,434
am in the throes of heartbreak.

315
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:34,236
Okay, fine,
I'll tell you about it.

316
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:41,326
Here is a hot beverage
to comfort you.

317
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:43,228
It's in a to-go cup.

318
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,080
Make of that
what you will.

319
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:49,701
Come on. It's still early.

320
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,086
Let's do something.

321
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:56,675
Well, I have been toying around
with an idea for 4-D chess.

322
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,393
How about we just talk?

323
00:14:58,395 --> 00:14:59,445
All right.

324
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,713
In 4-D chess...
No.

325
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:05,417
Come on, let's talk
about our lives.

326
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,302
Tell me something
about you I don't know.

327
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:08,720
Hmm.

328
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:14,176
I own nine pairs of pants.

329
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:18,013
Okay, that-that's a good start,

330
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,364
but I was thinking
maybe something

331
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:20,415
a little more personal.

332
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,784
I see.
Hmm.

333
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:27,189
I own nine pairs
of underpants.

334
00:15:29,492 --> 00:15:31,260
How about I go first?

335
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:34,413
But I don't want to know
how many underpants you own.

336
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:36,498
Although, based on the floor
of your bedroom,

337
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,250
I'd say it's a thousand.

338
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:42,754
Okay, look, here's something
people do not know about me.

339
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:44,590
When I first moved out
to L.A.,

340
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:47,042
I did a topless scene
in a low-budget horror movie

341
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:48,644
about a killer gorilla.

342
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:51,213
Ugh! After I did it,
I felt so ashamed.

343
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:54,383
Thankfully, that thing
never came out.

344
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:56,551
I've seen that.

345
00:15:57,504 --> 00:15:59,605
Yeah. <i>Serial Apeist.</i>

346
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:05,160
Howard found it online
the day we met you.

347
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:06,662
Oh, God...

348
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:07,729
And it was literally

349
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:09,464
the moment you walked
out the door.

350
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:16,004
But I see the type of personal
revelations you're going for.

351
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:19,708
Okay, here's one I thought
I'd take to the grave.

352
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,993
Okay.

353
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:23,295
Hmm.

354
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:24,680
A while back,

355
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,883
YouTube changed
its user interface

356
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:32,571
from a star-based rating system
to a thumbs-up rating system.

357
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:37,593
I tell people I'm okay with it,
but I'm really not.

358
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:44,116
That's your big revelation?

359
00:16:44,118 --> 00:16:46,852
Yes.

360
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:49,438
Whew! I feel ten pounds lighter.

361
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,156
Okay, you know what?

362
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:52,174
I give up.

363
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:54,192
I'm going to bed.

364
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:57,412
Here's something else
you don't know about me:

365
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:59,565
you just hurt my feelings.

366
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:00,766
What did I do?

367
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,334
I opened up and shared something

368
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:04,052
deeply upsetting to me,

369
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:06,221
and you treated it
as if it were nothing.

370
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:09,091
I-I didn't think
it was a big deal.

371
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:11,927
It is to me; that's the point.

372
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,465
Sheldon, you are right.

373
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,549
I'm really sorry.

374
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:19,217
I should've known better.

375
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,053
Your apology is accepted.

376
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:23,138
Thank you.

377
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,439
How about a hug?

378
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:25,924
How about a hearty handshake?

379
00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:27,826
Come on.

380
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:32,798
Now I know how you felt
getting mauled

381
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,034
by that sex-crazed
gorilla.

382
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:52,551
Good night.

383
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:54,336
Mm-hmm.

384
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:03,795
It was rather flattering to have
strangers send us drinks.

385
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:06,298
Yeah, that felt nice.

386
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:10,902
Maybe tomorrow morning
we put on some hot pants

387
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:14,106
and see if we can score us
some free omelets.

388
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:20,162
So, hypothetically, if-if we
were to have gone with them,

389
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,114
which one would you have picked?

390
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:25,734
I think I would

391
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:28,470
have gone with the short one
with the goofy haircut.

392
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:30,538
Oh, good, 'cause I liked
the tall thin one.

393
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,724
He seemed intelligent,
kind of a loner,

394
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:35,210
maybe a little sexually
inexperienced,

395
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:38,096
like I'd have to teach
him a thing or two.

396
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:41,817
Not my guy.

397
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:43,769
I caught him staring
at my rack.

398
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:46,721
It'd be nice to be with a man

399
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:49,491
who wants to know
what's underneath my cardigan.

400
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:52,494
FYI, it's another cardigan.

401
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,966
Your short sexed-up guy
kind of sounds like Howard.

402
00:18:57,968 --> 00:19:01,236
Your brainy virgin kind
of sounds like Sheldon.

403
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:03,839
Good night.
Night.

404
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:09,511
All right, Dr. Koothrappali,
it's been nice talking to you,

405
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:10,879
but I need to go home

406
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:12,013
and relieve my babysitter.

407
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:14,266
Yeah, I can relate
to being a single parent.

408
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:16,218
I have a dog.

409
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,054
Yeah, it's exactly
the same thing.

410
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:20,355
Good night.

411
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:22,023
Mrs. Davis...

412
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:24,860
I, uh, I must confess,

413
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:26,278
I came here tonight

414
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,014
in a futile attempt
to pick up some lonely postdoc,

415
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:33,251
but instead I got to connect
with you at a human level.

416
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:36,021
That's a much better evening.

417
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:38,824
You're a lovely person.

418
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:40,575
Are you hitting on me?

419
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:42,327
No, no, no, that would be crazy!

420
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:43,799
I mean, if I were hitting
on you, you'd know it

421
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,601
'cause you'd feel uncomfortable
and a little sad for me.

422
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,754
You're sweet.

423
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,707
Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.

424
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,809
Good night.

425
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:01,530
Looks like she accepted
your apology.

426
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,231
And then some.

427
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:05,317
I think we had a moment.

428
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,986
Oh, please, you did not
have a moment.

429
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:10,188
Who died and
made you king of moments?

430
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:15,110
Okay, fine. Let's say
there was a moment.

431
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,978
There was.
There wasn't.

432
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,082
But... But even if there was,
what are you gonna do about it?

433
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:27,005
I will slowly seduce her until
she falls helpless into my bed,

434
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,007
hungry for the pleasure
only I can give her.

435
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:30,876
So nothing.
No, not a thing.

436
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,355
Ah...

437
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:43,858
I'm so glad the police
finally caught

438
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,495
that psychotic
genetically engineered ape.

439
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,969
That is my girlfriend!
I swear to God!

440
00:20:56,506 --> 00:21:00,040
Leonard! Leonard!
Leonard! Leonard!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
