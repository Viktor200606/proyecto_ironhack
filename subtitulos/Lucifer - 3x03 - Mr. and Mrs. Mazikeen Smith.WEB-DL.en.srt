00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:48,458
Yeah, well, you had no problem

541
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,641
killing those two people in cold blood.

542
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:54,264
[sighs] Look, I've done a lot
of terrible things in my life.

543
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:55,665
That's not one of them.

544
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:56,867
I was framed.

545
00:21:58,303 --> 00:21:59,469
[groans, grunts]

546
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:01,004
I don't care.

547
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:02,539
Yeah, well, you should.

548
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,803
'Cause Herrera's gonna betray you next.

549
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:06,743
CHLOE: <i>Lieutenant Herrera?</i>

550
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:09,316
- And you must be Detective Decker.
- Uh, yes.

551
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,535
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

552
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,549
I know what this is
about, and I-I didn't mean

553
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,651
to stick my nose in another cop's case.

554
00:22:14,653 --> 00:22:16,659
Wait, wait. You think I'm mad?

555
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:17,862
[laughs] Are you kidding me?

556
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:19,231
You got me a new lead.

557
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:20,557
I'm here to thank you.

558
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,625
- Oh.
- Uh, you know,

559
00:22:22,628 --> 00:22:24,176
but now that you cracked it open...

560
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,729
- Mm-hmm?
- If you don't mind,

561
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:27,864
I want to carry this one
across the finish line.

562
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:29,518
Are you sure? I'm happy to help.

563
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:30,520
Don't worry,

564
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:31,801
I'll give you all the credit.

565
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:34,105
It's just that this
one means a lot to me.

566
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:36,519
The one that got away, you know?

567
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,764
Right.

568
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,702
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

569
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:41,845
Oh.

570
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:42,892
Yeah.

571
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:44,214
Yeah.

572
00:22:44,216 --> 00:22:45,483
Thanks, Detective.

573
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:50,553
Yeah, I used to work for
Herrera, just like you.

574
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:52,730
He sent me to track
people down, or worse.

575
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:55,478
Then, one day, I quit.
He didn't like that.

576
00:22:55,481 --> 00:22:58,079
That's a really nice
story, but like I said...

577
00:22:58,082 --> 00:22:59,429
- You don't care.
- I don't.

578
00:22:59,431 --> 00:23:01,770
- [knock on door]
- JOAN: Room service.

579
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:03,782
- Never run on an empty stomach.
- [door opens]

580
00:23:03,785 --> 00:23:07,003
Say one word and I'll break your arm.

581
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:08,538
Ah! Okay, all right.

582
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,790
Whatever you say. We're
just a happy couple.

583
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:12,928
Mr. and Mrs. Mazikeen Smith.

584
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,071
I've seen you before.

585
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,680
Hi.

586
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,816
All right.

587
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,452
Come on, Maze, pick up. Pick up.

588
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,921
[automatic gunfire, phone ringing]

589
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,126
Huh, not a good time, Decker.

590
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,362
[gunfire continues]

591
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:52,494
Hey, it's me again.

592
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,563
I-I know you think I'm
just being a worrier,

593
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,967
but there is something strange
going on with this case,

594
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,137
so call me back ASAP.

595
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,078
[sighs]

596
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,479
Hey.

597
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,548
Look, I have a favor to ask you.

598
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,717
[gun clicks empty]

599
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,986
Hello?

600
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,788
[singsongy]: Hello?

601
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,791
Everyone in here dead?

602
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,694
No? Didn't think so.

603
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,196
[gun clicks]

604
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,453
All right, we got to
get the hell out of here.

605
00:24:32,456 --> 00:24:34,423
We can't just wait
for her to mow us down.

606
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:36,007
Oh, I'm not waiting.

607
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,777
Seriously? Knives to a gunfight?

608
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:45,081
- What the hell was that suppo...
- [Joan grunts, gunfire stops]

609
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,217
JOAN: Ow.

610
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,619
And you're welcome.

611
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,055
[groaning]

612
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,513
See?

613
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:56,187
I don't need a gun to save your ass.

614
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,356
Come on. [groans]

615
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,864
Well, define "saved," exactly.

616
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,737
[groans]

617
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,300
LUCIFER: <i>I've never seen
the detective quite like it.</i>

618
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:11,742
She's afraid that Maze
will get bamboozled

619
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:14,213
into helping this handsome con man.

620
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:15,449
It's preposterous.

621
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:17,414
And you're not concerned?

622
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,615
Oh, please.

623
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,951
Maze and I have been through
the plagues, the floods,

624
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,486
the Dave Matthews Band.

625
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:25,589
She can handle a
measly bounty, I'm sure.

626
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,858
What if it's not a bounty she's after?

627
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,860
What if she's trying to prove something?

628
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,863
What, that she can
scare an entire country?

629
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,466
Or that her life has meaning.

630
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,868
With or without a soul.

631
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,336
- [laughs]
- Every one of us

632
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,872
wants to connect to something, Lucifer.

633
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,940
- Or someone.
- Oh, come on.

634
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,409
- She's a demon.
- [computer ringing]

635
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:48,212
Oh. Apologies. One sec.

636
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:55,836
Uh, I-I can't talk right now, Maze.

637
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,554
I'm with a patient.

638
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,123
Yeah, well, so am I.

639
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,658
[Rivers grunts]

640
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,341
Is that a gunshot wound?

641
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:05,077
Oh, Mazikeen, you little rascal.

642
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,980
Did you shoot the fellow? Well done.

643
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,216
No, I didn't shoot him.

644
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:10,133
Some psycho from room service did.

645
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,706
Well, so much for Canadian hospitality.

646
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:14,917
Look, I don't have
time to explain, okay?

647
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,675
How do I stop this human from dying?

648
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:19,309
LINDA: Take him to a
hospital, that's how.

649
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,077
I mean, how many times
do I have to tell you

650
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,646
I'm not that kind of doctor?

651
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,948
[Rivers screams, groans]

652
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,887
LINDA: Whoa. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

653
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,923
First things first,

654
00:26:27,926 --> 00:26:29,787
did the bullet go all the way through?

655
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:32,388
I don't know.

656
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,696
[screams]

657
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:35,258
Ow! What are you doing?!

658
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,793
Get... Stop it!

659
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,128
[gasps] Get... Will you s...

660
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,796
Oh, no, it's still in there.

661
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:40,931
- Good.
- Okay, all right.

662
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,382
Well, in order to stop the bleeding,

663
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:44,668
you're going to have
to remove the bullet

664
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,703
- and stitch up the wound.
- Oh.

665
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,438
Oh, yeah, you know what, I'm good.

666
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,140
Relax, okay?

667
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,374
I'm great at dismembering humans.

668
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,143
How hard can it be to fix one?

669
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,906
Maybe you should listen to him, Maze.

670
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:56,880
I mean, it's everyone's
right to refuse treatment.

671
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,249
He is my bounty and I am
taking him in one piece.

672
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,684
Just tell me what to do, Doc.

673
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:01,852
Uh, okay.

674
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,286
Uh, find the hotel sewing kit.

675
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,690
You can stitch him up
with that, and you'll need

676
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,425
alcohol for the wound.

677
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,795
[grunts]

678
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,398
[panting]

679
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,946
What?

680
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:18,286
Well, you're not <i>that</i> handsome.

681
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:19,765
That's helpful. Thank you.

682
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:20,982
You're welcome.

683
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:22,772
Got everything.

684
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,074
What...

685
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,271
Next.

686
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:27,210
Well, you'll have to...

687
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,560
- fish out the bullet.
- [chuckles]

688
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:32,081
Oh, you know what, I've
grown kind of attached to it.

689
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,218
I think I'm gonna keep
it. Thank you, though.

690
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:35,919
And if you have any sedatives,

691
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,487
I highly recommend he takes them.

692
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,989
You got any drugs?

693
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,858
- What?
- Too bad.

694
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,663
Sorry.

695
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,512
You know, I-I got this.
I'll let you know if he dies.

696
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:07,075
Is it me, or did the
most skilled torturer

697
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:10,247
Hell's ever known just
fluff that man's pillow?

698
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,147
It's not you.

699
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,282
Right.

700
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:17,518
Then it's true.

701
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,522
He broke my Maze.

702
00:28:25,895 --> 00:28:28,029
[grunts softly]

703
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,701
Well, this is different.

704
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:37,204
That's Miss Alien.

705
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:40,707
Nothing weird happened, if
that's what you're wondering.

706
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:42,229
I-I wasn't.

707
00:28:42,232 --> 00:28:43,380
But thank you.

708
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:44,924
[groans]: Oh.

709
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:46,449
Oh, my head hurts.

710
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:48,118
Yeah, pre-surgical knockout.

711
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:49,721
Least I got the bullet out, though.

712
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:51,713
Oh.

713
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:53,987
Is that a button?

714
00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:55,669
Sure.

715
00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:57,510
Come on. Get ready.

716
00:28:57,513 --> 00:28:58,913
We're leaving in five.

717
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:00,748
You take me back, I'm a dead man.

Not my problem.

Occupational hazard.

722
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:11,559
I'm telling you, Herrera paid
the security guard to lie.

723
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:12,943
It doesn't matter.

724
00:29:12,946 --> 00:29:14,995
Yeah, it does.

725
00:29:14,997 --> 00:29:17,364
I didn't kill those kids.

726
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:19,500

That's why I refused.

727

00:29:22,772 --> 00:29:24,171
No.

lose a piece of your soul.

Rivers is a con man.

767

there's something weird going
on with this Herrera guy.

770
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:07,931
If Rivers is so innocent,
why the hell did he run?

'Cause who would believe him?

772

You want to help this guy?

The best thing to do

786

over to the Canadians.

Okay, you were right.

It seems this Rivers fellow
may have indeed hoodwinked Maze.

Okay, who are you and what have
you done with the detective?

Turns out Maze spoke to Rivers.

812
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:35,037
He claims the security guard was lying,

813
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,441
that he was forced to
pin the murder on him.

814
00:32:37,443 --> 00:32:38,875
That's why Rivers is on the run.

815
00:32:38,877 --> 00:32:40,978

- Hey!

It's not like Maze to
reach out with a lead.

I know. This is much
worse than I thought.

fluffs the man's pillow,

00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,490

Do you know, I never thought
I'd say this, Detective,

824
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:56,788

- Back off.

898
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:00,615
He's mine.

899
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,483
Okay, first off,

900
00:36:02,485 --> 00:36:05,152
ladies, I don't belong to anyone.

901
00:36:05,154 --> 00:36:06,454
And, secondly,

902
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,656
I got these guys exactly
where I want them.

903
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:11,025
This gun to my head?

904
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:12,460
I like it there.

905
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,363
And these big scowly dudes,

906
00:36:15,365 --> 00:36:16,764
harmless.

907
00:36:16,766 --> 00:36:19,835
So you should go before
you get in the way.

908
00:36:20,707 --> 00:36:21,801
[groans]

909
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,797
What part of "you're my bounty"

910
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,541
do you not get?

911
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:31,178
I'm not going anywhere.

912
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,339
JOAN: Actually,

913
00:36:32,347 --> 00:36:34,281
that part's true.

914
00:36:34,283 --> 00:36:37,681
See, you saved us a trip.

915
00:36:37,684 --> 00:36:41,122
After all, we weren't about
to let you live after you threw

916
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:42,423
a damn knife at me.

917
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:44,158
Oh, well, thanks for bringing backup.

918
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,036
More fun for me. [chuckles]

919
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:48,161
Oh, and he's cute, too.

920
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,064
Bonus.

921
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:51,566
Kill her first.

922
00:36:58,274 --> 00:36:59,541
[grunting]

923
00:37:02,612 --> 00:37:04,079

925
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:09,817
Oh, crap.

926

Well, well, well.

931
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:37,172
Look who saved who.

932
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,293
I told you I had 'em.

933
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,486
[chuckles, groans]

[groans, chuckles]

936
00:37:52,795 --> 00:37:55,494
You opened your stitch, didn't you?

937
00:37:55,497 --> 00:37:58,934
I hope I didn't lose the button.
[coughs, chuckles]

938
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:01,139
[sirens wailing, helicopter
whirring in distance]

939
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:11,000
I'll handle this.

940
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:12,268
Go.

941
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:13,973
Come on.

942
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:20,721
[chuckles]

943
00:38:20,723 --> 00:38:23,142
Okay, seriously, this is getting old.

944
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:25,178
Why are you in my office now?

945
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:27,678
Uh, correction, it <i>was</i> your office.

946
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:30,355
Turns out murderers aren't
allowed to masquerade

947
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:31,791
as lieutenants anymore.

948
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:33,115
What are you talking about?

949
00:38:33,118 --> 00:38:35,302
He's talking about how you had

950
00:38:35,304 --> 00:38:37,642
those kids killed,
how you framed Rivers,

951
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:39,011
and you almost killed our friend

952
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:40,880
who was trying to clean up your mess.

953
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,910
[chuckles] Okay, wait a
minute, all right? Wait.

954
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:43,868
This is absurd.

955
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:46,592
You can't possibly believe
a-a con man's story.

956
00:38:46,595 --> 00:38:47,915
We don't have to.

957
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:50,799
We have testimony from the
guard you forced to lie.

958
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:52,386
Uh, and the hit man you hired

959
00:38:52,388 --> 00:38:54,291
is currently in Canadian custody.

960
00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:56,624
But don't worry, they
gave you all the credit.

961
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,259
You're under arrest.

962
00:38:58,261 --> 00:38:59,560
Oh, come on. Really?

963
00:38:59,562 --> 00:39:00,728
Yes. Really.

964
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,347
And if it's any consolation,

965
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,584
I suggested we beat you to
death with our bare hands,

966
00:39:04,587 --> 00:39:06,753
but the detective insisted
we do it by the book.

967
00:39:06,756 --> 00:39:09,924
And considering I know where
you're eventually going to go,

968
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:11,795
that's fine by me.

969
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:18,647
[sighs]

970
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:27,087
Thanks, Decker.

971
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:28,370
[phone beeps]

972
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:35,601
Well, looks like all your
whining finally paid off.

973
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:39,469
Herrera just got arrested for
the murder of those two kids.

974
00:39:39,472 --> 00:39:40,768
[exhales] So...

975
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,770
So...

976
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:44,713
so I'm not a fugitive anymore.

977
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,149
Yeah, which kind of screws me,

978
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:48,174
'cause you're also not
my bounty anymore either.

979
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,044
Mm.

980
00:39:50,046 --> 00:39:51,445
No good deed.

981
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:53,914
[both chuckle]

982
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:55,450

983
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,564
Did you hear what I just said?

984
00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:02,489
You don't have to run anymore.

985
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:05,733
You can... come home.

986
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,029
Yeah, you don't get it.

987
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,521
This doesn't end with Herrera.

988
00:40:11,524 --> 00:40:13,725
He's just a cog in the machine.

989
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:18,231
The people he works for,
they'll never stop chasing me.

990
00:40:18,234 --> 00:40:20,534
Okay.

991
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:21,850
Dramatic much?

992
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,678
If you worked for Herrera,
they know about you, too.

993
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,233
Everything about you.

994
00:40:26,236 --> 00:40:27,949
I sincerely doubt that.

995
00:40:27,952 --> 00:40:31,552
Yeah, well, you don't
know them like I do.

996
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,754
[groans softly]

997
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:37,232
I can never stop running, Maze.

998
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,693
But what if...

999
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:43,998
what if you came with me?

1000
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:47,915
We can do this, Maze.

1001
