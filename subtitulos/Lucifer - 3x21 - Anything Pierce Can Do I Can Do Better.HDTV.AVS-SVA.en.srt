1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,304
- Previously on Lucifer...
- Is it possible

2
00:00:02,307 --> 00:00:04,723
you're not dealing with
something? Chloe and Pierce?

3
00:00:04,726 --> 00:00:06,368
Perhaps you're not as okay with

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,869
that relationship as you think.

5
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:09,538
Decker's the one who's gonna suffer.

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,773
Getting her to fall for
you and then vanishing?

7
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:12,674
Ruthless.

8
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:14,176
I don't care who I have to hurt,

9
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:16,075
as long as it allows me to finally die.

10
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:18,346
Neither I nor Lucifer have the power

11
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:19,882
to get anyone into Heaven.

12
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:21,182
There's no hope for me.

13
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:22,450
I'm going to Hell.

14
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:23,700
And I am sick

15
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:25,875
of that stupid little brat of yours.

16
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,536
Pierce, I lo...

17
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,791
Stop.

18
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:30,659
I can't do this.

19
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:32,027
What?

20
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:33,361
Why?

21
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:35,063
Why did you hurt her?

22
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:36,831
Why?!

23
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:39,201
I couldn't... hurt her like that.

24
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:40,871
Your mark. It's gone.

25
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,781
Just like that... it's gone?

26
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:44,533
I don't understand. How?

27
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:45,979
How the hell

28
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:48,904
did you finally get rid
of your bloody mark?!

29
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:50,552
I don't know.

30
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:54,916
I guess the plan worked.

31
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,560
What plan?

32
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,138
The plan to get Chloe to fall for me.

33
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:03,479
And why would you have a plan for that?

34
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:06,604
'Cause I finally figured
out what makes us vulnerable.

35
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:07,940
Us?

36
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:10,760
It's Chloe's love.

37
00:02:10,762 --> 00:02:12,593
Think about it.

38
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:14,963
She loves you, you bleed.

39
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:18,265
Now she loves me, so I can die.

40
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:19,734
Well, congratulations,

41
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:21,916
'cause you've just
come to the most absurd

42
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,839
conclusion I think I've ever heard.

43
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:25,342
Is it?

44
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:28,477
I tried to stop her
from saying the words.

45
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,379
I didn't want to hurt her.

46
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:33,279
I guess I was too late.

47
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,085
She already loved me.

48
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:38,320
Well, allow me to disabuse you

49
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:41,127
of your misguided notions.

50
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,993
Regardless of the detective's
possible affections,

51
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:45,995
I think the reason
that your mark is gone

52
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,196
is glaringly obvious,

53
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:48,530
isn't it?

54
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:50,132
The moment you chose to pull the ripcord

55
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:51,471
on your dubious plan,

56
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:53,385
Dad chose to screw with you.

57
00:02:53,388 --> 00:02:55,070
By giving you exactly what you wanted.

58
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:57,026
I mean, come on, really.
It's God 101, isn't it?

59
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,510
I really wouldn't be so sure.

60
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:59,869
Well, you know what? Who cares

61
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:01,229
why your mark is gone.

62
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,302
The point is that you,

63
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:04,877
my mortally challenged
friend, can now die.

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,715
So just say the magic word

65
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:09,291
and I'll be... I'll be happy
to help you on your way.

66
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:12,287
Yeah? We'll go old school, shall we?

67
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:13,288
Come on!

68
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,723
Let's rock and roll!

69
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:15,779
Stop.

70
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:17,493
I got it.

71
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:18,591
Are you sure?

72
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:20,362
'Cause really, really, I don't mind.

73
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:21,664
I've got it.

74
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:25,200
Fine.

75
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:26,902
Suit yourself.

76
00:03:28,672 --> 00:03:31,573
- I guess this is good-bye.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:33,885
But, on the bright side,

78
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:36,011
see you never.

79
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:44,887
Hey, Ella, do we have, uh...

80
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:47,901
the-the forensics on the Duckworth case?

81
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:50,338
Dope shades, missy!

82
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:51,622
Thanks.

83
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:55,057
Yeah, I only wear mine inside
when I'm like, super hungover

84
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,733
or, you know, for some
reason I've been crying.

85
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:59,002
Right.

86
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:04,547
Oh, no.

87
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,650
What happened?

88
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,732
It's...

89
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:10,125
Pierce and I broke up.

90
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:11,127
What?

91
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,986
- Yeah.
- Why?

92
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,291
You were so great together.

93
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:16,752
Uh, yeah. I... I don't know.

94
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:20,222
I guess he just, he
freaked out and he ran.

95
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:21,666
I-I'm guessing

96
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:24,693
he's terrified of intimacy. I...

97
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:27,377
I'm just trying not
to take it personally,

98
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,252
'cause it's not like this is
the first time this has happened,

99
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:31,861
so I just...

100
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:33,658
wonder if it's something I'm doing.

101
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,471
No way.

102
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,744
That is some bull to
the crap, right there.

103
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:38,906
Okay, anyhow...

104
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,401
I'm gonna walk into Pierce's office

105
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,411
and I'm gonna give that
studly, big-armed man

106
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:43,510
a serious what for.

107
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:44,813
Hey.

108
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:46,643
Please do not say anything.

109
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:49,986
All right? It's just gonna
make things more complicated.

110
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:52,587
Fine.

111
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:54,947
Okay, I-I won't interfere.

112
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,174
How could you do this to her?

113
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:58,526
You made her so happy!

114
00:04:58,529 --> 00:04:59,599
If you must know,

115
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:01,128
I was trying to protect her.

116
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:03,026
I broke things off

117
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:05,268
because I didn't want to hurt Chloe.

118
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,471
I know you're my boss, so
don't take this the wrong way,

119
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,871
but do you know how stupid that sounds?

120
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:11,557
If you really cared about her,

121
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,476
then what are you protecting her from?

122
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:16,678
I guess nothing anymore.

123
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:19,396
I can actually be with her.

124
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,449
I can grow old with her.

125
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:22,284
Uh, maybe...

126
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:23,240
I mean, that's a little

127
00:05:23,243 --> 00:05:25,052
cart before the horse, don't ya think?

128
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,055
No, you're right, Lopez.
I totally screwed this up.

129
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:28,435
Yeah. You did.

130
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:30,772
- I need to win her back.
- Mm-hmm.

131
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:32,142
How am I gonna do that?

132
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:35,430
I have faith.

133
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:51,813
- Good morning!
- Morning.

134
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:55,318
Detective, uh, as someone
who goes to therapy,

135
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,786
I understand you must have many...

136
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,244
feelings following last night's debacle.

137
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:00,799
So, if you feel the need to discuss...

138
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:02,257
No, it's okay. I really
don't want to talk about it.

139
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,792
Excellent. I mean, you know,

140
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:05,541
whatever works for you works for me.

141
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:08,196
After all, if all goes as
it should, we'll probably

142
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:10,832
never be hearing from that
lying lieutenant ever...

143
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,468
again...

144
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,910
Shouldn't you be, uh, I don't know,

145
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,455
having tea with Hitler by now?

146
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,619
Change of plans. I don't
want to die anymore.

147
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:28,283
I want to win Chloe back.

148
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:29,377
I beg your pardon?

149
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,753
No time to explain.

150
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:33,922
Okay, I know you probably
hate me right now,

151
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:35,567
but please, just hear me out.

152
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,104
You were right, about
last night... I got scared.

153
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,829
Things got very real between us and I...

154
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,666
I couldn't handle it. Okay?

155
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:46,947
And... I'm not used to feeling this way.

156
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,724
And I realize that now and that's why

157
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:50,639
I promise it'll never
happen again, because...

158
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:54,510
because I love you.

159
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:57,455
What?

160
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,271
I love you, Chloe.

161
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:06,855
Wh-What do you expect me to say to that?

162
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:08,890
Well, that you love me, too.

163
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:12,939
Look, Marcus, as much as I appreciate

164
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:15,409
hearing you say those words...

165
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:17,193
that's what they are:
they're just words.

166
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:18,849
I can't trust them anymore.

167
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,318
Our victim is Reina Markova,

168
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:27,600
29, prima ballerina
for the L.A. West Ballet

169
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:28,833
four years and running.

170
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:31,174
Cleaning staff found her when
they came in this morning.

171
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:32,402
Any witnesses?

172
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:34,575
Uh, no. She's known for
taking rehearsals alone.

173
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,091
Especially when she's two days away

174
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:37,593
from a big premiere like Giselle.

175
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:39,380
Hmm. Hey, Ella.

176
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:40,849
Any idea of the time of death?

177
00:07:40,852 --> 00:07:44,372
Looks like she was killed
roughly ten hours ago.

178
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,757
Oh, what a coincidence.

179
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,059
She's been dead almost as long

180
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:48,880
as your dreadful relationship to Pierce.

181
00:07:48,883 --> 00:07:50,416
They broke up?

182
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,158
Actually, he broke up with her.

183
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:54,083
- Okay.
- What about cause of death?

184
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:55,325
Right.

185
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:56,828
Well, according to

186
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:58,724
the ligature marks on her throat,

187
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:00,627
she was strangled...

188
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,544
using the ties from this.

189
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:05,138
She was killed with her own shoe?

190
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,825
Not her shoe. Different size.

191
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:08,419
But why leave the murder weapon behind?

192
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,055
Maybe whoever did this
freaked out and ran?

193
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,935
- We've seen it before.
- Oh, yes, we have,

194
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:14,872
from the lowest form of
scum on earth... like Pierce.

195
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:17,217
Well, come on.

196
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,062
I mean, we're all
thinking it, aren't we?

197
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,363
Anyway, time to get the
slipper back to the lab.

198
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:26,335
Any other questions, here's my prelim.

199
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,174
Uh... I'm gonna join her, 'cause...

200
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,930
because this is awkward.

201
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,258
Oh, and, uh, personally,

202
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:36,694
I'm with you, buddy.

203
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:38,086
Screw that guy.

204
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,485
So, we're searching

205
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:41,753
for a murderous Cinderella.

206
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:43,266
Yes, someone timelessly evil.

207
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,567
Almost like a cretinous
lieutenant named...

208
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:45,664
Enough, Lucifer.

209
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,555
This murder has nothing
to do with Pierce.

210
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:48,987
Well, not literally, perhaps...

211
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,623
I know you want me to hate him.

212
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:52,292
To tell you he's terrible.

213
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:55,106
But the truth is, our relationship

214
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:56,653
is none of your business.

215
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:58,621
- Former relationship, you mean?
- Yes.

216
00:08:58,624 --> 00:08:59,887
- Yes.
- No, no...

217
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,468
- No?
- I-I don't, I don't know.

218
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,356
Point being, you need to back off.

219
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:05,838
Whether I decide

220
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:08,465
to take Pierce back or not, it just,

221
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:10,309
it has nothing to do with you.

222
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:20,248
Or maybe it still does.

223
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:28,551

224
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:31,273
Great news!

225
00:09:31,276 --> 00:09:33,437
The detective still makes me bleed.

226
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,934
Which means there's hope.

227
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:36,967
Uh, hope for...

228
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:39,224
Well, for the detective, of course!

229
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:40,995
Hope that she hasn't fully succumbed

230
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,133
to that intolerable knob, Pierce.

231
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:44,849
Even if he has lost his mark.

232
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,343
Pierce lost his what now?

233
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:48,179
Allow me to catch you up.

234
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:52,916
So, the lieutenant
has a ridiculous theory

235
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:54,918
that, shockingly, may hold water.

236
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,958
He believes that the
detective's affections

237
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,130
are what make me vulnerable.

238
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,680
And now that she cares for him...

239
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,497
Well, long story short, old
ham hands isn't cursed anymore.

240
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,505
He's mortal.

241
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:07,898
So, your vulnerability is proof

242
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,044
that Chloe cared for you...

243
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,402
but now she cares for Pierce,

244
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:14,068
- so now he's vulnerable, too.
- Close.

245
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,770
She cares for Pierce and me.

246
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:18,642
As proven by my bleeding.

247
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:22,012
Yet, for some inexplicable reason,

248
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:23,748
she's on the fence
between the two of us.

249
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,615
And how does that make you feel?

250
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:28,752
Well, it makes me feel...

251
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,021
like I...

252
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:35,586
like I need to tip
the scales in my favor.

253
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:36,922
Show her

254
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:38,591
which side the grass is greener on.

255
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,498
And why do you want to
tip Chloe to your side?

256
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,781
Because, as her partner,

257
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:46,002
it's my duty to save her from
making a terrible mistake.

258
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:47,037
Uh-huh.

259
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,190
Pierce has clearly blinded her

260
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:49,538
with his charming oaf routine.

261
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,138
So I need to open her eyes.

262
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:54,700
Show her that I'm better than
him in every possible way.

263
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:56,763
And what if Chloe does choose you?

264
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:59,783
Well, then, things can finally
go back to the way they were,

265
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:03,486
before Pierce, obviously.

266
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:06,556
Uh...

267
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:09,888
Why do I feel like I should've
stopped him this time?

268
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:11,380
What the hell is this?

269
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:13,396
It's pretty self-explanatory.

270
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:15,421
- The plan is off.
- Why?

271
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,825
We were so close to
getting happily-sexed Decker

272
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:18,868
to fall for you.

273
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,766
Yeah, and I messed it up,
okay? I broke up with her.

274
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,337
You broke up with her?

275
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,116
What happened to
getting rid of your mark?

276
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:29,519
Doesn't matter.

277
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,533
I'm done with grand
plans and manipulations.

278
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:35,051
I don't want to use Chloe anymore.

279
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:36,853
What about what I want?

280
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:38,852
Because if we don't
get Chloe to love you,

281
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:40,590
then we can't lift your curse.

282
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:42,727
And if we can't lift your curse,

283
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,794
then I can't kill you
and hang it on Lucifer.

284
00:11:45,797 --> 00:11:47,664
Framing Lucifer for murder

285
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,133
is the only way to blow
up his life on Earth.

286
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:51,242
Keep your voice down.

287
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,414
What don't you get?

288
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:54,504
My side of the plan
doesn't work without yours.

289
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,039
And I need this

290
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,807
to get back to Hell.

291
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:01,412
I'm sorry. Like I said, the plan's off.

292
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,521
Says you.

293
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:14,672
Detective.

294
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:15,974
Pardon my tardiness,

295
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:17,841
but I come bearing gifts.

296
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:19,481
What is this?

297
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,658
Well, I know how you like
your seasonal beverages,

298
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:23,641
so I got you a "Luck o' the Irish" Latte

299
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,664
and... oh! To be sure, to be sure,

300
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,330
little something extra.

301
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,242
Oh, y-you got me a lemon bar.

302
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:35,184
Mm, well, they're your
favorites, aren't they?

303
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,613
- Mm...
- Look, Detective,

304
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:39,449
I know that you're going through
a difficult time right now,

305
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:40,367
and what you need

306
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,650
is someone who knows you.

307
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,253
I know. It's just...

308
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:44,222
- Um...
- It's just what?

309
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:47,325
Ooh, lemon bars. My favorite. Mmm.

310
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:49,851
Oh, man, these are
amazing. Who made 'em?

311
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:51,353
Uh, Pierce did.

312
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,151
Would you believe that hunk bakes?

313
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:56,989
On second thought, who
needs the empty calories?

314
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,192
Hmm.

315
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,470
Hmm, looks like someone

316
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,506
is trying to crawl their
way out of the doghouse.

317
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:04,453
Mm-hmm

318
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:05,946
- Is it working?
- Yes, is it?

319
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:08,413
Let's just focus on the case.

320
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,718
Ella, what do you have?

321
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,418
Uh, so I got a lead
off the murder weapon.

322
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:14,770
No match on the DNA, but I
did find a signature of sorts.

323
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,452
The ballet shoe had traces

324
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:18,589
of olive oil, Evian and beeswax.

325
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:21,504
So our killer's a bumblebee
with expensive taste?

326
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:22,840
Or a ballerina.

327
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,429
Dancers all have their own unique way

328
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:25,429
of prepping their shoes.

329
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:27,320
And, according to her social media,

330
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:29,637
guess who uses those exact ingredients?

331
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,582
Reina's former understudy

332
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:35,098
and L.A. West Ballet's
new prima ballerina,

333
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:36,981
Amber Fontaine.

334
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,976
So either she took out her competition

335
00:13:39,978 --> 00:13:41,744
or the killer somehow
got one of her shoes?

336
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:44,981
No, no, no, definitely
looks like a Black Swanto me.

337
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:49,957
And bras and up. Ladies, arms out...

338
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,293
Sorry to interrupt.

339
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:52,498
We'd like to speak

340
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:54,375
- with Amber Fontaine.
- For what?

341
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:55,874
We're extremely busy here.

342
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,003
Yes, us, too.

343
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:59,561
Solving the crime of a
brutally murdered ballerina.

344
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:01,263
But Amber didn't have
anything to do with that.

345
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:02,938
And we only got two days

346
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:06,034
- to get this show up and running.
- Easy, easy, Gwen.

347
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:08,075
They're just doing their jobs.

348
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:09,254
I'm sorry.

349
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:11,756
We're just all pretty
emotional right now.

350
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,293
Yes, clearly some more than others.

351
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:15,945
We know it was your shoe

352
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:17,680
that was used to strangle Reina.

353
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:20,016
That's crazy.

354
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:22,429
The killer must've stolen
them out of my locker.

355
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,364
I mean, Reina's locker.

356
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:27,890
Look, respect for going
full Tonya Harding,

357
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,258
but if you're gonna kill someone,

358
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,160
you should get your
story straight first.

359
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:34,797
No, Reina's locker was
mine for, like, a week

360
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,700
when she left the
company for her new gig.

361
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:39,437
But when she came back,
I had to return it.

362
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,770
I-I must've left my
pointe shoes in there.

363
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:43,940
- Where were you last night?
- Home.

364
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:46,109
Sleeping like a baby.
You can ask my roommate.

365
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:48,265
Now that Reina's dead,

366
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:50,078
I'm back to being tied in knots.

367
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:51,879
Yes, murder can do that.

368
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:53,723
No, as much as I thought that I wanted

369
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:58,054
her spot, to be able to dance
with a legend like Miguel,

370
00:14:58,056 --> 00:15:00,512
I-I wasn't ready.

371
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,457
I was happy to keep learning from Reina.

372
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,788
I thought it was our
gain and their loss.

373
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,813
Whose loss exactly?

374
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:10,218
You know, America's
Next Prima Ballerina.

375
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,695
The TV show Reina was gonna host.

376
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:18,674
You know, I'm inclined to
believe our young ingenue.

377
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:20,743
If there's nothing she and
Reina were competing for,

378
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:23,051
it makes her motive far less compelling.

379
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,004
Yeah, we need to look into this TV show,

380
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,356
see why she turned it down.

381
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,263
Well, it certainly wouldn't
be art over commerce.

382
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:30,617
No one has that kind of passion...

383
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:35,424
Are those from...

384
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:38,094
Marcus. Yeah.

385
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:40,097
Bastard.

386
00:15:41,498 --> 00:15:44,961
Luci, what is so urgent?
Why'd you call me here?

387
00:15:44,964 --> 00:15:47,132
Because enough is enough. It's time.

388
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:50,659
We need to get rid of Pierce.

389
00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:54,779
What exactly do you mean by

390
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:56,276
"get rid of Pierce"?

391
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,163
Well, what do you think I mean?

392
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,098
Yeah, we're not gonna kill him, Luci.

393
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,475
I know, angels can't kill humans,

394
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:03,553
yadda yadda yadda.

395
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,870
Spare me the lecture.
Besides, killing Pierce

396
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:07,279
isn't the answer anyway

397
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:08,983
because, inexplicable as it is,

398
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:10,675
the detective actually
cares for the man,

399
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,444
and breaking her heart isn't the goal.

400
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:15,276
I got to admit, I'm a little
fuzzy on that one myself.

401
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,448
What is the goal?

402
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,233
For the detective to
realize she needs to pick me

403
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:22,170
over that blithering
clod, Pierce, which...

404
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:23,906
gah, shouldn't even be an issue, but...

405
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:27,191
- I'm in.
- You are?

406
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,863
You are my brother and my test.

407
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,397
Whatever needs to be done.

408
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,514
Well, I have to admit,

409
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:36,615
I didn't expect that
to be quite so easy,

410
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:39,837
but I'm not one to look
a gift-angel in the mouth,

411
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,939
I'll take it.

412
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,326
So what's the plan?

413
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:44,242
We need to make the detective realize

414
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:46,495
that Pierce isn't the
man she thinks he is.

415
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:48,162
We need to prove to her

416
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:52,311
that he is a two-faced,
loathsome biblical liar.

417
00:16:52,314 --> 00:16:54,719
I mean, how hard can that be?

418
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,090
He is the man behind the whole
Sinnerman thing, after all.

419
00:16:58,092 --> 00:17:01,897
Um... what?

420
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,334
Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't I tell you?

421
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:08,032
Fun fact: Pierce equals
criminal mastermind.

422
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:09,668
Anyway...

423
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,081
You run with that, and I'll
keep working on the detective.

424
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:15,123
Read my lips:

425
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:18,006
Dance is pain.

426
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:20,279
You want to feel sorry for yourselves?

427
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:23,014
Then go back to Kansas
or wherever you're from.

428
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:25,349
That is Myles Druker.

429
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:28,453
Only one of the most amazing
choreographers in the world.

430
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:30,144
Choreographer with a bum leg?

431
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:33,091
Is this one of those, "those
who can't, teach" scenarios?

432
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,920
He was a dancer who lost
his leg in a car crash.

433
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,639
But he never believed
in playing the victim.

434
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,729
Instead,

435
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:43,601
he turned his tragedy
into an inspirational story

436
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,937
for all of us to follow.

437
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,730
He's also the creator of
America's Next Prima Ballerina,

438
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,275
the show that Reina was gonna host,

439
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,795
until she reneged on her deal
and it cost him a fortune.

440
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:53,975
Right. Well, I don't see why

441
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:55,831
he wouldn't take such a loss in stride.

442
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:58,884
- You see what I did there?
- Mm-hmm.

443
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:00,217
In stride?

444
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,885
You must be aware that Reina Markova

445
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:03,387
was killed last night.

446
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,593
Yeah, I heard. Big whoop.

447
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:10,084
Well, for a potential
cold-blooded killer,

448
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:12,167
you're being quite... obvious.

449
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,133
I mean, I just don't think
Reina was much of a professional.

450
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,268
Then why'd you hire her?

451
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,971
Let's just say I was... pressured

452
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,420
into our collaboration.

453
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:22,708
By whom?

454
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,677
By none of your business.

455
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,644
Look, I'm a very busy man,

456
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,988
so unless you're gonna charge me
with anything, we're done here.

457
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,849
Well, actually, no.

458
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:32,884
I just have one more question.

459
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:34,252
Uh, take note, Detective.

460
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:35,866
Here's something I can
do that other people,

461
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:37,590
rhymes with Shmierce, cannot.

462
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,591
Tell me,

463
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:43,028
what is it that you truly desire?

464
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,865
- I wish...
- Yeah.

465
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,858
That car crash never happened.

466
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,802
Why? 'Cause it crushed your leg?

467
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:54,272
No.

468
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:56,274
Because it didn't crush my leg.

469
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:57,342
Oh!

470
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,745
Right, well.

471
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:01,481
Care to explain?

472
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:08,456
Everyone believes the
accident ruined my career.

473
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:12,057
Well, the truth is, it made it.

474
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,164
I built my brand on the notion

475
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,167
that I could overcome anything.

476
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,265
I walk around with a
prosthetic every day

477
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:22,868
covering my real leg.

478
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:25,969
Polypropylene.

479
00:19:25,972 --> 00:19:28,339
Oh. So is that why Reina left the show?

480
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:29,792
She found out you were a fraud?

481
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:33,712
No, she quit because I
accused her of blackmailing me.

482
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,279
I was sent an e-mail

483
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:38,983
with a video that exposed me...

484
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:40,552
You know, with two working legs...

485
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,487
Said that if I gave Reina a
job, the video would disappear.

486
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,448
So I did.

487
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:45,557
But she didn't send it?

488
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,692
Apparently not,

489
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:48,393
even though it was sent
from her e-mail address,

490
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,362
because when I confronted
her, she went ballistic.

491
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,941
Said that she didn't need any
handouts and quit right there.

492
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:56,183
But if she didn't
blackmail you, then who did?

493
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:57,365
Beats me.

494
00:19:57,368 --> 00:20:01,237
Right. Well, you better
not be pulling our legs.

495
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:12,301
What are you doing here, Charlotte?

496
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:13,771
Isn't it obvious?

497
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,754
I'm a terrible person that's...

498
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,091
that's led a terrible life, so I'm...

499
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:22,160
I'm preparing myself for damnation.

500
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:23,951
In a three-star hotel?

501
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:25,797
It's what I deserve.

502
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,733
Well, it's time to sober up.

503
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:30,202
I need your help with a legal matter.

504
00:20:30,204 --> 00:20:33,476
Don't you want to ask
someone less damned?

505
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,645
I don't think so.

506
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:36,081
I need to find a way to prove

507
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:39,077
that Lieutenant Pierce
is the criminal mastermind

508
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,032
also known as the Sinnerman.

509
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:42,534
Say again?

510
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:46,585
Lieutenant Pierce has
been leading a double life

511
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:48,220
for quite some time now.

512
00:20:48,222 --> 00:20:49,612
I need to prove it,

513
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,909
and then I need get
him out of the picture

514
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:53,492
so that Lucifer can be with Chloe.

515
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:59,011
I'm gonna need a little
bit more information.

516
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:02,501
A very long time ago,

517
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:07,105
God tasked me with blessing
a couple with a miracle child.

518
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:10,733
Now, that child became Chloe Decker,

519
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,756
who, it appears,

520
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,483
was placed on this Earth

521
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:17,272
to cross paths with Lucifer.

522
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,209
Now, since Lucifer is my test,

523
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:24,216
bringing those two together
must be my final task.

524
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:25,852
At which point,

525
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:28,889
hopefully I'll be restored
in my Father's eyes.

526
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:31,537
Okay, let me see if I
understand this correctly.

527
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:37,170
I help you,

528
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:40,123
I help enact God's will?

529
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:41,951
In a way, yes.

530
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:44,154
And could that...

531
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:47,611
put me in His good graces as well?

532
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:49,080
Maybe.

533
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:50,615
Good enough.

534
00:21:50,617 --> 00:21:53,303
I'm in.

535
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:55,306
And I think I know how to get started.

536
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:07,131
Well, I'd say that was rather
impressive, wouldn't you?

537
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:09,575
I exposed a fraud of a
man and got us a lead.

538
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,873
It's like the whole
world is pointing towards,

539
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:13,787
well, me, today.

540
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,194
Yes, Lucifer,

541
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:17,733
very impressive.

542
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,006
Unfortunately, until cyber traces

543
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,678
this blackmail e-mail,

544
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:23,014
we have nothing to do tonight.

545
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:24,752
Oh, nonsense, nonsense.
The night's still young.

546
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:27,076
Why don't we, um, I don't know,

547
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,113
- go for a drive?
- For a drive?

548
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:31,951
What are we, 80? Why
would we go for a dri...

549
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:33,758
Ta-da!

550
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,576
I mean, it's not flowers, but

551
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:40,715
it does go zero to 60 in, well... fast.

552
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:48,005
You...

553
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:50,476
- You got me a car?
- Mm-hmm.

554
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:54,976
Wait, do you think this is
some sort of competition?

555
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:57,882
Of course. If it isn't
painfully obvious,

556
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:01,592
anything Pierce can do, I can do better.

557
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,834
It's not about stuff, Lucifer.

558
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:13,842
Thanks anyhow.

559
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:27,910
Good morning.

560
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:31,512
Good morning?

561
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:35,182
Last I checked, didn't you move out?

562
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:36,917
It's mea culpa time.

563
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:38,385
I came to earn my way back

564
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,321
into the house.

565
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:42,897
Really? And how do
you plan on doing that?

566
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,465
Well, I tried to think
of something nice,

567
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:47,934
but that's not really my strong suit.

568
00:23:48,764 --> 00:23:51,197
But then I heard you
and Pierce broke up.

569
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,316
So, I figured he hurt you.

570
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,905
Maybe I just hurt him back?

571
00:23:57,907 --> 00:24:00,674
Thanks, but-but no.

572
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:02,651
I mean, at least not yet.

573
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:03,741
Ah.

574
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,059
Men are so fricking confusing.

575
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:13,098
Yeah, they're dumb. Really dumb.

576
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:15,089
Mm-hmm.

577
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:16,559
What happened?

578
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:19,226
Well...

579
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:22,029
one minute, things
with Marcus are great.

580
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:23,230
- Mm-hmm.
- And then the next,

581
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,399
he ends things, and, uh...

582
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:29,637
And now he's doing all of these...

583
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:32,506
really, really sweet
things to win me back.

584
00:24:32,508 --> 00:24:34,262
And it does seem really nice,

585
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,285
but I just don't know if I can trust it.

586
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:37,311
I don't know, ho...

587
00:24:37,313 --> 00:24:39,379
How do you know if you can trust people?

588
00:24:39,382 --> 00:24:42,059
It's simple. I can't.

589
00:24:42,062 --> 00:24:43,715
People will always let you down.

590
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:45,840
You know what I do trust? Pain.

591
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:47,288
And I admit,

592
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,722
Pierce is in a whole lot of it.

593
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:50,398
What? How do you know that?

594
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:55,863
Well, I may have already gone
to his house to kick his ass

595
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,621
before it occurred to
me I should probably

596
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:59,453
have asked for permission.

597
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,689
- Maze...
- But I...

598
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:03,030
I stopped myself. So there's that.

599
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,918
Oh, Pierce was putting on a brave face,

600
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:11,012
but... dude was hurting.

601
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:14,773
Hey, Mom, what's for break...

602
00:25:14,784 --> 00:25:15,884
Hey.

603
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:24,793
It's gonna... take a little time.

604
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,273
Hey, Dan, what's up?

605
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:32,477
Cyber came back.

606
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:34,367
Turns out the blackmail e-mail Myles got

607
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,769
pinged to an apartment registered

608
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:37,705
to a William Sterling...

609
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:40,520
Chairman of the board
of L.A. West Ballet,

610
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:43,386
well-known surgeon,
married, two children.

611
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:45,723
Why would he be trying
to get Reina a new job?

612
00:25:45,726 --> 00:25:47,900
Uh, maybe he was trying to
get the company some press.

613
00:25:47,903 --> 00:25:48,902
Who knows?

614
00:25:48,905 --> 00:25:50,179
Uh, what's the address?

615
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,770
- Lucifer.
- Detective.

616
00:25:59,773 --> 00:26:00,949
Good morning. Please,

617
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:02,963
- come in.
- What are you doing here?

618
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:05,762
Well... I realized that you were right.

619
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,568
It's not about the stuff
that I can give you,

620
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,746
it's about actions.

621
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:11,113
So, I decided to get a jump on the case

622
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:12,949
and take a few things off your plate.

623
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:14,777
Which, I might add, is
the opposite of Pierce,

624
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,332
whose job it is to put
things on your plate.

625
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:19,402
- Uh-huh. Where's Sterling?
- Not here.

626
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:21,271
Which is convenient,
as it's given me time

627
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,074
to learn a few things about our, well,

628
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:24,818
slightly deranged suspect.

629
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,145
Lucifer, did you break in here?

630
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:29,171
Detective...

631
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:31,418
I'm disappointed you'd
think so little of me.

632
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:32,825
Would you believe it if I told you

633
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:35,184
an attractive neighbor
with a key simply let me in?

634
00:26:35,187 --> 00:26:37,168
Unfortunately, yes.

635
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:39,333
Excellent. Then, on with the tour.

636
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:41,101
So, I have come to the conclusion

637
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:43,937
that we are inside the
lair of a creepy stalker,

638
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:45,093
evidenced by photos

639
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:47,476
of Sterling with Reina.

640
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,809
Clearly photoshopped.

641
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:50,544
Uh, some of her

642
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:52,246
undergarments lying around.

643
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:54,137
Don't want to know how he got those.

644
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,417
And, um... for the grand finale...

645
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,504
a shrine dedicated to
Reina's old costumes.

646
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:02,848
Probably liked the smell of
her old sweat... disgusting.

647
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:04,157
Lucifer, I think...

648
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,692
Sterling is a lovesick obsessive

649
00:27:05,694 --> 00:27:07,194
who wanted to see Reina's star rise?

650
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:08,528
Yes, me too. But clearly his gift

651
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,631
of a shiny new job wasn't met kindly,

652
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,833
and so he...

653
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:14,635
Aha!

654
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:16,703
Ha, I caught you, you sicko!

655
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:19,039
What did I say, Detective?

656
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,674
Actions, not stuff.

657
00:27:20,676 --> 00:27:23,585
Lucifer, let him go. He's not a stalker.

658
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:25,871
He and Reina were having an affair.

659
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:27,981
Isn't that right, Mr. Sterling?

660
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:30,350
Uh...

661
00:27:30,352 --> 00:27:33,420
I never met anyone quite like her.

662
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:35,322
She was the love of my life.

663
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:38,160
You mean, the love of
your Tuesday afternoons

664
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:40,288
and occasional Saturday
mornings, don't you?

665
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,723
You are married, with offspring,

666
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,119
are you not?

667
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:46,098
You don't always get to pick
who you fall in love with.

668
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,520
Is that why you
blackmailed Myles Druker,

669
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:53,573
to show Reina how much you cared?

670
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:55,301
I don't know what you're talking about.

671
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:58,378
There's a blackmail video that
was sent from Reina's e-mail.

672
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,180
It was pinged from
this physical address,

673
00:28:00,182 --> 00:28:01,515
and that's why Myles hired her.

674
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:02,807
And when she found out, she quit.

675
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:04,944
Did she confront you? Rebuff you?

676
00:28:04,947 --> 00:28:06,313
'Cause it can be quite daunting

677
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:08,219
when somebody doesn't
appreciate your gifts.

678
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:09,622
Perhaps you,

679
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,613
oh, I don't know, lost your temper.

680
00:28:11,616 --> 00:28:14,294
Uh, that's absurd. I didn't care

681
00:28:14,296 --> 00:28:15,529
who Reina worked with.

682
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:17,130
I certainly wouldn't hurt her over it.

683
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:18,474
But if you didn't send the e-mail,

684
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:20,067
- then who did?
- Mm.

685
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:22,369
I don't know.

686
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:25,307
Maybe someone snuck onto her computer.

687
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:29,309
- Is that her computer?
- Yeah.

688
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:31,845
Who else knows about this place?

689
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:35,148
No one, I thought.

690
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,550
Guess I was wrong.

691
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:38,085
Okay, well, we're gonna need to

692
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:40,120
take the computer into evidence.

693
00:28:42,098 --> 00:28:43,704
I cannot believe

694
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:45,106
how well this is working out.

695
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:47,594
I mean, finding Pierce
with a known fence?

696
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:50,426
Who knew the LAPD could be so helpful?

697
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,441
Well, the LAPD didn't help with this.

698
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:54,278
I called in a favor, had
Pierce's phone hacked.

699
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,602
Charlotte!

700
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:56,803
If I wanted to break the law,

701
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:58,472
I wouldn't have gone to a DA.

702
00:28:58,474 --> 00:29:00,208
And if I hadn't cut
corners, we wouldn't be here

703
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,411
as quickly or efficiently or
as... Well, hell, who cares?

704
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:05,371
We're working for God now. Right?

705
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:07,247
Well...

706
00:29:07,249 --> 00:29:10,217
can't argue with results.

707
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:12,231
Okay, I think we got what we need.

708
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:13,934
Uh, not exactly.

709
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:16,923
I'm afraid all that you have
are a few photos of an envelope.

710
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:18,191
If we want to expose Pierce,

711
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:19,761
we have to find out what's inside.

712
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,464
Aw, crap. He's on the move.

713
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:25,465
Well, maybe we...

714
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:33,940
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
need to borrow your bike.

715
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:35,410
Don't worry, it's for God.

716
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,325
Who are you?

717
00:30:18,328 --> 00:30:19,780
Why are you following me?

718
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:23,114
I said, who are you?

719
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,980
Ms. Richards.

720
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:36,348
Why are you...

721
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,683
Following you?

722
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:41,153
Well, it seems I let my better judgment

723
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:43,322
get away from me.

724
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:44,423
I don't understand.

725
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,159
It's complicated.

726
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:49,761
See...

727
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:52,197
when I heard that you
and Chloe broke up,

728
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,101
I started thinking about you.

729
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:58,803
I know how hard it is

730
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,931
to be stuck in a dark place.

731
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:03,475
Sometimes, all it takes
is the right person

732
00:31:03,477 --> 00:31:05,210
to get you out.

733
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:07,112
After all...

734
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:09,749
we both have needs.

735
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:12,718
Another time.

736
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,572
Hell, I'd be the
luckiest guy in the world,

737
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:16,990
but I'm in love with Chloe.

738
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,926
Sorry.

739
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:27,205
I know we knew what was on this video,

740
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:31,270
yet somehow actually seeing
Myles' fake-fake leg...

741
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:33,137
- So much grosser.
- Great.

742
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,440
The man's an embarrassment

743
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:36,108
to both dance and prosthetics.

744
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,995
Well, we're just lucky that
cyber could retrieve this

745
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,411
from Reina's computer.

746
00:31:39,413 --> 00:31:41,737
Dan, is there any way to tell
who made this from the footage?

747
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:43,923
Nothing, no voice. Not
even a measly cough.

748
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:45,595
Whoever did this was
pretty damn careful.

749
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:47,353
Yeah, we're still
waiting for DNA results

750
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:48,650
from the computer's keyboard,

751
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:51,673
but if the killer wore gloves,
I mean, we're out of luck.

752
00:31:56,764 --> 00:31:58,330
It's Pierce.

753
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,301
Well, someone needs to hit "ignore."

754
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:03,603
We'll get it.

755
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:07,439
Hey, Pierce, what's up?

756
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:08,700
Chloe, hi.

757
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:10,814
Listen, I realize that
lemon bars and flowers

758
00:32:10,817 --> 00:32:11,884
aren't gonna cut it.

759
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:13,736
I think I figured out
a way to prove to you

760
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:14,780
you can trust me.

761
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:17,282
Can you meet me at my
place for dinner tonight? 8-00?

762
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:18,486
Eh, I don't know.

763
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:19,618
Chloe, please.

764
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,986
Listen, if you don't
want to see me after,

765
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:23,388
I promise I will never bother you again.

766
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,325
Just... just come over.

767
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:27,728
You gotta eat, right?

768
00:32:27,731 --> 00:32:30,970
Okay. Yeah, I can do dinner.

769
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:33,031
Great. I'll see you then.

770
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:34,633
- Detective.
- Hmm?

771
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:37,369
I couldn't help but
overhear a part of your call

772
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,204
and I understand that you're torn,

773
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:40,931
but before you make a decision

774
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:42,474
about Pierce I'd like the chance

775
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:44,376
to express some
thoughts to you, as well.

776
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:46,822
Okay. Go ahead.

777
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,422
Right, well, I...

778
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,147
Actually, can we do this in private?

779
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,017
My place, one hour?

780
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,858
Uh... okay.

781
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,527
Lovely.

782
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:12,404
Detective.

783
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:14,547
Thank you for coming.

784
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:20,567
I thought you were having
me over to tell me something?

785
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,748
Well, all shall be
explained in due time.

786
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,018
But please, take a seat.

787
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:30,679
Now, I hope you like

788
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:31,814
chateaubriand.

789
00:33:31,817 --> 00:33:34,960
Um...

790
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:39,152
Lucifer, what is all this?

791
00:33:39,155 --> 00:33:40,966
This is to help you

792
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:44,799
make an appropriate
decision about your future

793
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:46,168
and, dare I say,

794
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:47,467
our future.

795
00:33:52,353 --> 00:33:54,897
Now, we've been through
a lot, Detective.

796
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,035
But now the two of us are alone
in front of this beautiful meal

797
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,587
in this romantic setting, I can finally

798
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:04,902
ask you the question I
brought you here to answer

799
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:08,788
and I hope, well, I hope
you can answer honestly.

800
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:16,702
Isn't this better than
anything Pierce could do?

801
00:34:20,953 --> 00:34:24,755
You did all of this
to... to show up Pierce?

802
00:34:24,765 --> 00:34:27,266
It's impressive. I know.

803
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:31,084
Detective.

804
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,821
Those aren't tears of joy, are they?

805
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,856
Why are you doing this to me?

806
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:41,277
To prove to you that you
shouldn't be with Pierce.

807
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,128
Why do you care who I'm with?

808
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:46,725
'Cause he... he doesn't deserve you.

809
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:48,935
Then who does deserve me?

810
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:53,203
Someone...

811
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:54,639
someone better.

812
00:34:54,642 --> 00:34:57,644
You can't have it both ways, Lucifer.

813
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:02,582
Detective, I...

814
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:05,355
Hey, Dan. What's up?

815
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:06,551
We got a lead.

816
00:35:06,553 --> 00:35:08,964
So, DNA on the computer
came back negative.

817
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:12,910
So, we decided we had to watch
the creepy leg video again.

818
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:14,105
But that's when we saw it,

819
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:16,027
hidden in the window's reflection.

820
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,314
It looked like one of
those Magic Eye pictures.

821
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:20,418
- You know the ones where it looks like...
- G-Guys, what did you see?

822
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,660
- Oh. Yeah.
- Oh, right. Yes.

823
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:24,397
We are sending over the
enhanced image as we speak.

824
00:35:28,764 --> 00:35:31,010
Recognize that costume?

825
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,292
Okay, we know Miguel
is behind the video,

826
00:35:43,295 --> 00:35:45,757
but what I don't understand is why.

827
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:48,042
Why would he risk everything

828
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,714
just to get rid of Reina?

829
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:51,116
Well, isn't it obvious?

830
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,569
He wanted to be with her.

831
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:01,673
There.

832
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:03,483
Why did you do it?!

833
00:36:03,486 --> 00:36:05,803
Why did you have to
take Reina away from me?

834
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:10,732
Answer me. Why did you kill Reina?

835
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:12,452
Drop the weapon!

836
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,397
You had no right! You had no right!

837
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,889
Wait!

838
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:18,125
Don't you see?

839
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:19,863
He didn't want to kill Reina.

840
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:21,075
Lucifer, get back.

841
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:22,577
He tried everything to simply

842
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:23,811
get her out of the way.

843
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:25,793
All those times you came to pick her up.

844
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:28,149
She was your friend.

845
00:36:28,151 --> 00:36:29,646
How could you hurt her?

846
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:31,683
I thought he cared for her.

847
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:34,277
Yes. But she was also an obstacle

848
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,827
to being with the woman
Miguel loved... Amber.

849
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:41,925
But why kill Reina?

850
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:44,130
Because she found out I was
trying to blackmail Myles.

851
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,332
She was gonna get me fired.

852
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:46,422
And then he wouldn't even be able

853
00:36:46,424 --> 00:36:48,068
to work in the same company as Amber.

854
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:50,338
Why didn't you just
tell Amber how you feel?

855
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,873
Tell her the truth?

856
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,141
Because...

857
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:54,842
I was afraid.

858
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:57,754
Afraid she wouldn't love you back.

859
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,782
But I do.

860
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:04,594
I-I do have feelings for you, Miguel.

861
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:17,598
I'm sorry.

862
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,601
I'm so sorry.

863
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:23,503
To think...

864
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:26,407
you could've had everything you wanted.

865
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:29,377
All you needed to do was
tell Amber how you felt,

866
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:30,746
but you blew it.

867
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:43,025
And so did I.

868
00:38:22,473 --> 00:38:24,608
It's got to be around here somewhere.

869
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:34,139
Oh, I got it.

870
00:38:36,412 --> 00:38:37,678
It's empty?

871
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,491
I don't understand.

872
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:44,784
Was he on to us?

873
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:47,542
I mean... did he destroy what's inside?

874
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:49,277
Maybe he just took it with him.

875
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,233
I'm sorry, Charlotte.

876
00:38:51,236 --> 00:38:52,668
We did everything that we could.

877
00:38:52,671 --> 00:38:55,293
We're just too late.

878
00:38:55,296 --> 00:38:58,132
Don't be ridiculous.

879
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:02,069
If I believed in "too late" I
wouldn't be doing any of this.

880
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:04,972
No, we are not giving up.

881
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:09,491
After all, you don't quit
when you're doing God's work.

882
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,553
I'm so sorry.

883
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:24,324
Ever since you left my
office, I've been struggling

884
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:26,460
between my role as your therapist

885
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:29,085
and my concern for you as a friend.

886
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:35,369
Friendship won.

887
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:37,402
But too late, it seems.

888
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:41,125
Well, I royally screwed
up this time, Linda.

889
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,879
Turns out

890
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:45,746
I'm just as bad as our killer.

891
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:48,613
Oh, God. You killed Pierce?

892
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:51,796
No.

893
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:53,354
No.

894
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:57,550
But I did try everything to get
that lovesick, former immortal

895
00:39:57,553 --> 00:40:00,161
out of the picture when
really all I should've done

896
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:03,231
was told the detective how I felt...

897
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,539
how I really feel.

898
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:15,476
Then why don't you?

899
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:18,012
I can't.

900
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:21,007
What are you so afraid of?

901
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,394
At first it was your devil face.

902
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:25,769
What now?

903
00:40:25,772 --> 00:40:28,168
You don't want Chloe to
see that you have wings?

904
00:40:28,171 --> 00:40:30,433
Who cares?

905
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:33,012
- I do! I care!
- Why?!

906
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:35,347
Because she doesn't
have a choice, does she?

907
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,631
Neither do I!

908
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:39,600
It's all part of His
master plan to toy with us,

909
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:42,152
to make us dance for
His bloody amusement.

910
00:40:42,155 --> 00:40:43,763
That's an excuse.

911
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:45,399
Don't you see?

912
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,402
You're doing the same thing as Him now.

913
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,058
By not telling Chloe the truth,

914
00:40:51,061 --> 00:40:53,744
you're taking her choice away.

915
00:40:53,747 --> 00:40:54,793
No.

916
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:56,217
No.

917
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:57,925
No, it's different.

918
00:40:57,928 --> 00:41:00,321
You know, the truth is...

919
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:04,105
no one really knows what
your dad's responsible for.

920
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:07,094
We're all just guessing.

921
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:09,397
Even you.

922
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:12,100
But you know the one
thing He can't control?

923
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,199
What you do in this moment right now.

924
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:20,074
So I ask you,

925
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:23,678
the Devil...

926
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,374
what do you truly desire?

927
00:41:32,101 --> 00:41:34,835
I want her to choose me.

928
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:37,472
Then tell her.

929
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:39,761
Yes.

930
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:44,577
Yes.

931
00:41:57,408 --> 00:41:58,941
I'm sorry for just stopping by,

932
00:41:58,944 --> 00:42:00,425
but when you didn't make dinner...

933
00:42:00,428 --> 00:42:03,718
No, I, i-it's... I'm sorry.

934
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,121
This case has, you know, been...

935
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:09,023
It's okay.

936
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:12,236
I can say what I need
to say here... now.

937
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:15,639
Okay.

938
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:19,566
For days I've been thinking
about how I screwed up.

939
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:22,011
Tried to figure out how
to make things better.

940
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:26,173
When you find that person
who gives life meaning,

941
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,566
Chloe, nothing else matters.

942
00:42:28,569 --> 00:42:29,844
Okay, well...

943
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:31,723
I know you don't trust me.
I know I've made mistakes.

944
00:42:31,725 --> 00:42:35,311
I've made an eternity's
worth of mistakes.

945
00:42:35,314 --> 00:42:37,347
But please, let me
spend the rest of my days

946
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,683
making it up to you.

947
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:41,010
What? What are you doing?

948
00:42:45,007 --> 00:42:47,941
Chloe Decker, will you marry me?

949
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,199
Yes.
