1
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:04,208
Oh, boy.

2
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:07,340
What?

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,005
I can't comment
without violating our agreement

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,180
that I not criticize your work.

5
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:14,347
Then what was "Oh, boy"?

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,610
Great restraint on my part.

7
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,227
There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

8
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:24,550
Perhaps you mean a different thing
than I do when you say, "Science."

9
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:33,074
How's that?

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,825
You actually had it right
in the first place.

11
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,919
Once again, you've fallen
for one of my classic pranks.

12
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:42,750
Bazinga!

13
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:50,558
Now here's a peculiar e-mail.

14
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,808
The president of the university
wants me to meet him

15
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,918
at his office
tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.

16
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:56,593
- Why?
- It doesn't say.

17
00:00:56,718 --> 00:00:58,226
It must be an emergency.

18
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:00,785
Everyone at the university
knows I eat breakfast at 8:00

19
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,760
and move my bowels at 8:20.

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,830
Yes, how did we live before Twitter?

21
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,454
I guess you'll find out
what it is in the morning.

22
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,447
That's 14 hours away.

23
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:15,396
For the next 840 minutes,

24
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:17,492
I'm effectively one
of Heisenberg's particles;

25
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:19,793
I know where I am
or I know how fast I'm going,

26
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:21,138
but I can't know both.

27
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:22,872
Yet how am I supposed to carry on

28
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,918
with this huge annoying thing
hovering over my head?

29
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,794
I know the feeling.

30
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:50,771
Subtitles: The FW Team

31
00:01:57,678 --> 00:01:59,326
Sheldon, it's 2:00 in the morning.

32
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,933
Why does everybody keep telling me
what time it is?

33
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:06,252
- Everybody?
- You, the president of the university,

34
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:08,805
his wife,
their sullen teenage daughter.

35
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:12,043
That entire family is fascinated
by what time it is

36
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:13,913
and whether people know it.

37
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:17,553
You went to President Seibert's house
in the middle of the night?

38
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,977
He didn't respond to my e-mail,
his phone number is unlisted.

39
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:23,225
Tell me what my other option was.

40
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,019
You could have waited until morning.

41
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,313
I know, look who I'm talking to.

42
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,172
Do you remember
the grant proposal I submitted

43
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:33,955
to the National Science Foundation

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,997
to detect slow-moving monopoles
at the magnetic North Pole?

45
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,717
Hardly a day goes by
when I don't think about it.

46
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,099
How nice.

47
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:44,258
Well, a space opened up

48
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:48,033
at the last minute on the NSF
expedition to the Arctic Circle.

49
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,521
Wait a minute.

50
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:55,716
He offered to send you
to the North Pole?

51
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,843
In fact, he was quite enthusiastic.

52
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,806
He said, "Frankly,
if I could send you tonight, I would."

53
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:05,757
Okay, well, do you want to go?

54
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:08,604
Of course not.
I'm a theoretical physicist.

55
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,044
A career I chose in no small part
because it's indoors,

56
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:16,893
but if I'm able to detect
slow-moving magnetic monopoles there,

57
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:19,614
I will be the scientis
to confirm string theory.

58
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:21,699
People will write books about me.

59
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,447
Third-graders will create
macaroni-art dioramas

60
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,598
depicting scenes from my life.

61
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:31,523
Sure, maybe a tableau of me
trying to pummel you to death.

62
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,962
Sarcasm?

63
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:35,774
Maybe.

64
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,394
I'm on the horns of a dilemma.

65
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,894
Can you imagine me, Sheldon
Cooper, at the North Pole?

66
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,432
Easy peasy, I'm doing it right now.

67
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,627
I'm not good with cold.

68
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:51,273
How often have we had
to leave a movie theater

69
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,649
because I got a headache
from drinking the Icee too fast?

70
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:56,944
- I can't go.
- Then don't go.

71
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:58,923
How can you say that?

72
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,532
The scientific opportunity
of a lifetime

73
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,868
presents itself
and my best friend says "Don't go."

74
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,239
- All right, then go.
- Listen to you.

75
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,167
How can I possibly go?

76
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:13,592
What are the words
I can say right now

77
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,963
to end this conversation
and let me go back to sleep?

78
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:20,428
Odd, President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

79
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:25,099
- How was it resolved?
- It wasn't.

80
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,684
His wife set their dogs on me
and rendered the question moot.

81
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:33,044
Just imagine.
If he says yes,

82
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,919
we'll have an entire summer
without Sheldon.

83
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:39,642
We could play outside.

84
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,616
We could sit
on the left side of the couch.

85
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:46,371
I could use the bathroom at 8:20.

86
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:53,125
Our dreams are very small,
aren't they?

87
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:58,672
Good news, gentlemen,
I have tentatively accepted...

88
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:07,723
... the invitation to join
the Arctic Expedition.

89
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,559
It's not gonna be the same
without you.

90
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:14,718
Thank you,
but your sentiments may be premature.

91
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,566
I don't like where this is going.

92
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:19,693
I would like to propose...

93
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,774
that the three of you accompany me.

94
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,128
To the North Pole?

95
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:30,120
Is this just so we won't touch
your stuff while you're away?

96
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,990
I'll admit that was a concern.

97
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:36,549
But the fact is,
I'll need a support team.

98
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,921
And the three of you
are my first choice.

99
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:40,255
Really?

100
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,336
There are others
who might be more qualified,

101
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:45,255
but the thought of interviewing them
gave me a stomachache.

102
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,222
I know I'm proposing
an enormous undertaking.

103
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,307
So, why don't you take
a few moments to discuss it?

104
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:56,277
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

105
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,232
I'm still within earshot!

106
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,360
You may want to wait
for my door to close.

107
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:06,864
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

108
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,534
Hang on. Let's talk about it.

109
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:11,327
This is a National Science
Foundation expedition.

110
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:13,080
I don't know how
we can turn it down.

111
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:17,251
Easy. Instead of saying, "No, we
don't want to go on an NSF expedition,"

112
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,961
say, "No, we don't want to spend

113
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:22,990
"three months stuck in a cabin in
the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag."

114
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:27,613
But if we were part of the team
that confirmed string theory,

115
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:31,123
we could drink for free
in any bar in any college town

116
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:34,398
with a university
that has a strong science program.

117
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:37,207
Howard, this is big science.

118
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:39,430
You could be the engineer
who builds the equipment

119
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:41,483
that puts us on the cover
of magazines.

120
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:43,649
I could also be the engineer

121
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:46,474
who builds the crossbow
that kills Sheldon.

122
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,542
You still might get on a magazine.

123
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,832
So you guys are seriously
considering this?

124
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,433
- You think you can put up with Sheldon?
- Well, I'm a Hindu.

125
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:04,968
My religion teaches
that if we suffer in this life

126
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:06,800
we are rewarded in the next.

127
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:09,011
Three months
at the North Pole with Sheldon,

128
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,479
and I'm reborn as a well-hung
billionaire with wings!

129
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,067
Well, gentlemen,
have you reached a decision?

130
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:26,029
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

131
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,199
Damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.

132
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:33,934
Excellent.
Just an FYI,

133
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:35,874
as I am
the expedition's team leader,

134
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,728
protocol dictates
that be phrased, "Fine, sir."

135
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,929
But don't worry,
there will be a briefing.

136
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:13,796
What do you want?

137
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:16,829
I need access to the Cheesecake
Factory's walk-in freezer.

138
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,671
Honey, I already told you,

139
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:21,988
the hamburger meat is fresh
and stored at a safe temperature.

140
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,024
This is to train

141
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:27,923
for a three-month expedition
to the magnetic North Pole.

142
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:29,741
What?

143
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:33,262
I don't know how that sentence
could possibly confuse you...

144
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:37,655
but to elaborate,
I'm going to the Arctic Circle

145
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:39,684
with Leonard, Wolowitz
and Koothrappali.

146
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:41,645
- You're all going?
- Yes.

147
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,230
- For three months?
- Yes.

148
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,306
Excuse me.

149
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:50,133
Is that a yes or a no
on the freezer?

150
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:53,247
That woman has
the attention span of a gnat.

151
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,286
Sheldon says you're going
to the North Pole.

152
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,745
Pretty cool, huh?

153
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:01,789
Yeah. I'm just a little surprised
you didn't tell me.

154
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:03,974
It all happened kind of fast.

155
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:06,711
And we had to get physicals
and buy thermal underwear

156
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,334
and study up on, you know,
snow and stuff.

157
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,759
Sorry, I was gonna tell you.

158
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:16,155
You don't have to apologize.
There's no reason you have to tell me.

159
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,212
I was just...
you know, surprised.

160
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:21,024
You were busy, you were surprised,
all very fascinating.

161
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:23,562
Now where do we stand
on the freezer?

162
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:26,844
- Is he serious?
- Actually, it would help.

163
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:30,092
All right, I'll see what I can do.

164
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,961
So, three months at the North Pole.

165
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,490
That is... awesome.

166
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:38,948
I'm sorry, but at what point
do you put this

167
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:41,514
"see what you can do" plan
into action?

168
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,877
Just a warning, Sheldon...

169
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,457
The freezer locks from the outside.

170
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:54,338
Did she seem upset to you?

171
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,512
Did she seem upset to you?

172
00:09:57,969 --> 00:09:59,389
Good, I got it right.

173
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,345
Are you upset?

174
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:07,246
- A little bit.
- Two for two. I'm on fire.

175
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:12,334
I know she's not
my girlfriend or anything,

176
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,333
but wouldn't you think
she'd feel a little bad

177
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,572
that I'm going to be gone
for the whole summer?

178
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,867
That feels like a bonus question.

179
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,130
I'm going to stop here while I'm ahead,
but I've had a great time.

180
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:34,812
All right,

181
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:38,200
the purpose of this drill
is to acclimate us

182
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:40,344
to the use of tools
in extreme temperatures

183
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:42,391
such as we will face
in the Arctic Circle.

184
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:43,976
Where are your tools?

185
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:45,548
Right here.

186
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,927
All right, team,
open up your practice kits.

187
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:53,527
As the university did not permit me
to bring the actual equipment

188
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,424
we'll be using
to the Cheesecake Factory,

189
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:57,810
because apparently,
I'm "ridiculous,"

190
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:01,994
I've provided substitutes which
will exercise your fine motor skills.

191
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,329
Leonard, you will be doing a series

192
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,525
of complex mathematical problems

193
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,168
on a vintage Casio model
1175 calculator watch I received

194
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:13,221
when I won the Earth Science medal
in 3rd grade.

195
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:16,549
Treat it with respect.

196
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,513
Raj, you will be painting
sideburns and a Van Dyke

197
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,315
on a six-inch figurine
of Legolas the elf.

198
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,687
Now, remember, a Van Dyke
is a goatee without a mustache.

199
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,169
Wolowitz, you will be completing

200
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:34,416
a series of delicate
surgical procedures

201
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,307
on the classic children's game
"Operation."

202
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:43,526
To begin with, you will

203
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:46,217
"remove funny bone
for two hundred dollars."

204
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:49,958
For this I went to MIT.

205
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,461
And begin.

206
00:11:58,004 --> 00:12:00,054
I think I swallowed some paint!

207
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:03,706
I can't press
any of the buttons with my gloves.

208
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:06,737
Son of a bitch!

209
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,395
Adversity is to be expected.
Continue.

210
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,331
Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.

211
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:17,069
- Okay, I can't do this.
- Me either.

212
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,876
Gentlemen, use your imagination.
Innovate.

213
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:24,451
Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze
to death on the ice planet of Hoth?

214
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,643
He cut open a tauntaun

215
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:29,956
and used its internal body heat
to warm him up.

216
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,085
You heard the man.
Hold him down and I'll cut him open.

217
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:36,630
Hang on, I know I don't possess
the tools of leadership,

218
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:40,717
but why can't we assemble the equipment
inside the hut and then take it outside?

219
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:44,930
I hadn't thought of that.

220
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:49,124
I guess we're done here.

221
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:54,439
Here,

222
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,441
drink slash eat this.

223
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:00,237
- What is it?
- Hot chocolate with a stick of butter.

224
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:03,698
Okay, why?

225
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,724
In the frigid temperatures
in the Arctic,

226
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:08,018
we need to consume at least
5,000 calories a day

227
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:09,663
just to maintain our body weight.

228
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,499
You know I can't eat butter.
I'm lactose intolerant.

229
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,335
Way ahead of you, that's an
"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" stick.

230
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:19,631
But Mummy, all the other guys
are going to the North Pole.

231
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,967
<i>I don't care
what the other guys are doing.</i>

232
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,285
<i>If the other guys jumped
in the Bay of Bengal</i>

233
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,888
<i>and tried to swim to Sri Lanka,
would you follow them?</i>

234
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,876
If you were standing
behind me nagging, I might.

235
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,062
<i>Don't talk back to your mother.
This trip is much too dangerous.</i>

236
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:36,621
No, it's not. Howard, tell them.

237
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:41,319
Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali,
<i>namaste.</i>

238
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,147
I understand your concern,
but if it'll make you feel any better,

239
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:47,081
my mother is fine with me going,

240
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:51,063
and it's a woman who kept a safety rail
on my bed until I was 17.

241
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,469
<i>So, she has no problem
with her son being eaten by a walrus?</i>

242
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,001
That's very unlikely,
Mrs. Koothrappali.

243
00:13:58,126 --> 00:13:59,296
If Raj dies,

244
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,152
it'll be from frostbite,
gangrene, acute sunburn

245
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:05,382
or being ripped to shreds
by a 1,500 pound polar bear.

246
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,544
Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone
with Raj's parents.

247
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:12,998
Can you tell them that you're okay
with me going to the Arctic?

248
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:16,680
<i>Arctic?!
I thought you said Arkansas!</i>

249
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,587
I didn't say that.
You never listen to me!

250
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:23,398
<i>He doesn't tell me anything!</i>

251
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:26,335
<i>He lives a secret life
because he's ashamed!</i>

252
00:14:28,663 --> 00:14:30,202
Can I talk to you for a sec?

253
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,741
Sure, but let's go out here

254
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,491
where there's a little
less yelling and guilt.

255
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:36,875
What's up?

256
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:39,377
Well, I got you
a little going away present.

257
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:42,756
- A blanket.
- No, not just a blanket.

258
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:44,902
See, it has sleeves.

259
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:56,186
So, you can be all snoodled up
while you do your science stuff.

260
00:14:58,093 --> 00:14:59,115
Cool.

261
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:02,204
I'm gonna miss you.

262
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:12,077
- See you later.
- Bye.

263
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,960
<i>I told you no!
Why don't you believe me?</i>

264
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,801
<i>'Cause it doesn't make sense to me!</i>

265
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:25,985
<i>How can it be
that in the entire country of India,</i>

266
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,538
<i>there isn't one Outback Steakhouse?!</i>

267
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:40,977
I want a cookie, Meemaw.

268
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:44,943
It's me.

269
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:47,342
But Meemaw just made cookies.

270
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,533
I don't know if I can go
on the expedition.

271
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:53,515
What?

272
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,829
I don't think I can go
to the North Pole.

273
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:00,517
I know you're concerned
about disappointing me

274
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,226
but I want you to take comfort
from the knowledge

275
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:06,188
that my expectations
of you are very low.

276
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:09,730
Yeah, that's very comforting.

277
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,016
Comforting is a part of leadership.

278
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:14,973
It's not a part I care for,
but such is my burden.

279
00:16:15,593 --> 00:16:18,852
Terrific, it's just that...
I don't think Penny wants me to go.

280
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:23,148
Assuming that's a valid reason
not to go, which it isn't...

281
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,359
How do you know this?
Did she say it?

282
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:28,260
Not exactly.

283
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:31,531
But she said she was gonna miss me
and she gave me this.

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,329
- What is it?
- It's a blanket with sleeves.

285
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:39,461
That's clever.

286
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:44,169
Let me see
if I understand correctly.

287
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,886
Her missing you

288
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,506
is an emotional state
you find desirable?

289
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:50,842
Yes, obviously.

290
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,759
Well, given that missing you
is predicated on you leaving,

291
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:57,634
logic dictates you must leave.

292
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,509
Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone
for three months.

293
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:05,774
What if she doesn't miss me that long
and she meets someone else?

294
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:09,262
She does have
a short attention span.

295
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:11,071
So, I can't go.

296
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,188
Leonard, you may be right.

297
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:15,610
It appears that Penny
secretly wants you in her life

298
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,370
in a very intimate
and carnal fashion.

299
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,939
- You really think so?
- Of course not.

300
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,352
Even in my sleep-deprived state,

301
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:29,620
I've managed to pull off
another one of my classic pranks.

302
00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:31,869
Bazinga!

303
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:43,516
- What time is it?
- It's 7:00 a.m. I'm sorry it's early,

304
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,855
but we're leaving soon,
and I needed to talk to you.

305
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:51,069
What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

306
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,372
I don't know.

307
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:56,806
You'll be gone and I'll notice.

308
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,206
What about this?
What does this mean?

309
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:06,229
Wine, credit card
and late night television

310
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:07,954
are a bad combination.

311
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,656
All right, fine.

312
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:14,634
What about that really long hug?
What did that mean?

313
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,137
That wasn't a long hug.

314
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,613
It was at least five Mississippis.

315
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:25,926
A standard hug is
two Mississippis tops.

316
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:31,234
Leonard, I don't know what to tell you.
It was just a hug.

317
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:34,487
- Glad we cleared that up.
- Yeah.

318
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:35,806
I guess I'll see you.

319
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,074
- Okay, have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

320
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,161
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

321
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,905
It means I wish you weren't going.

322
00:18:58,207 --> 00:18:59,804
- Damn it.
- What?

323
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:01,617
We're out of ice.

324
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,937
All right, we begin initial assembly
and deployment of the testing equipment

325
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,401
starting tomorrow at 0700 hours,

326
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:11,983
but until then,
you are all off duty.

327
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,157
I suggest you keep
the shenanigans to a minimum

328
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:18,448
as medical help is
18 hours away by dogsled.

329
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,650
- What are you working on?
- Crossbow.

330
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,748
Hey, guys, can I just say something?

331
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,751
How about we take a moment
to think about where we are right now?

332
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:32,889
This is literally
the top of the world.

333
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,406
Only a handful of people
in all of human history

334
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:37,634
will ever see
what we are going to see.

335
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:39,882
He's right.

336
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,614
It is remarkable.

337
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,775
So, who's up for a movie?

338
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,564
Good idea, what do you think?

339
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,390
<i>Ice Station Zebra</i>
or John Carpenter's <i>The Thing</i>?

340
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,493
- I say double feature.
- Dinner's ready!

341
00:19:55,516 --> 00:19:58,253
- What are we having?
- Reconstituted Thai food.

342
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,908
Did you bring the dehydrated
low-sodium soy sauce?

343
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,522
- Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
- Check.

344
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:06,204
Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?

345
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:10,124
Sorry.

346
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,411
Not to worry.

347
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:12,590
I hid it.

348
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,333
Bazinga!

349
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,850
You're in my spot.

350
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:34,995
There's no time for a crossbow.
Find me an icicle.

351
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:42,276
Three months.
This is gonna be great.
