1
00:00:00,527 --> 00:00:02,109
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,112 --> 00:00:03,840
What do you desire?

3
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:05,473
I want her to choose me.

4
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:07,645
I never told you what
I want. I want you.

5
00:00:07,648 --> 00:00:10,574
So you thought I wouldn't
find out your mark is fake.

6
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:12,843
Maybe not tonight, but
I am coming for you.

7
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:15,192
Neither I nor Lucifer have the power

8
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:16,647
to get anyone into Heaven.

9
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:17,781
I'm going to Hell.

10
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:19,049
Well, I was hoping
that you might be able

11
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:20,150
to help me out again.

12
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:22,954
Any chance to get in
His good graces, I'm in.

13
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:25,382
I know you're not trying
to freak Chloe out,

14
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:26,657
but you're getting in her head.

15
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,392
- Let's elope.
- I can't marry you.

16
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:30,761
I'm sorry, Marcus.

17
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:33,064
- Oh, no ring.
- No ring.

18
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,876
Hey.

19
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:49,246
You know, I'm really glad
that you told me how you felt.

20
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,849
Oh, I don't know.

21
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,651
All that unresolved sexual tension?

22
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:55,986
It was kind of fun.

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,532
They're gonna burn the house down

24
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,367
if we don't get out there.

25
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:13,661
I made the batter, Dan.

26
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:14,805
Oh, yeah?

27
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:17,341
Well, sweet, because the
waffle king has arrived.

28
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,744
Step aside, my lady.

29
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:22,613
Good morning, Micah.

30
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,295
Thanks for your help.

31
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,933
Hey.

32
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:45,069
Are you okay?

33
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,773
Is it the same nightmare?

34
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:54,045
Except this time, you were in it.

35
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,918
So...

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,320
are you going to tell Chloe now?

37
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:04,886
Tell her what?

38
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:07,122
Uh, everything.

39
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,393
What we talked about in your penthouse

40
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,428
before she got engaged?

41
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,767
When you said, "I
want her to choose me."

42
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:18,635
Right. Yes.

43
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:20,082
No, no. No need.

44
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,773
She broke it off with Pierce, so I win.

45
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,307
Yes, I know that they broke up,

46
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,943
but just because she
didn't choose Pierce

47
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,726
doesn't mean she chose you.

48
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,614
And just because she un-chose Pierce

49
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,348
doesn't not mean she didn't choose me.

50
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,984
Point is,

51
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,152
no need to rock the boat.

52
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:36,864
I mean, we all know
how the detective gets

53
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,888
when you push her.

54
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,004
Plus, you know, she's on the rebound.

55
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:41,770
- Those are excuses.
- I think

56
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:45,496
it's best if everyone involved
just goes back to normal.

57
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,262
Easier said than done, Lucifer.

58
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:50,835
Yes, you may be right.

59
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:54,153
Maybe I should do normal

60
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:55,801
rather than just say it.

61
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:58,356
Huh? Help speed things along a little.

62
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:01,137
Ah. Another nugget.

63
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,513
Thank you, Doctor.

64
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,181
Yep.

65
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,064
Back to normal.

66
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:18,195
Is that really Forest Clay's wife?

67
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,563
Chloe.

68
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:21,577
Before you say anything,

69
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,834
I just really want to apologize for...

70
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,423
the event that should not be named.

71
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:27,991
- The what?
- The bachelorette party

72
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:29,725
from hell. I-I got caught up.

73
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:31,866
- I acted selfish. Just...
- Ella, it's fine.

74
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:34,478
- And...
- Is that someone playing piano?

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,804
I think so.

76
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:37,648
At a crime scene?

77
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:47,304
You look familiar. Have we met?

78
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:48,405
What?

79
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:51,343
Then you ask if I like to play cop.

80
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,093
And I say, "No, I like
to play in general,"

81
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,125
Detective, except you were on
the other side of the piano.

82
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:57,804
That's right, yes. That's
what we said when we first met.

83
00:03:57,807 --> 00:03:59,002
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

84
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,605
I'm reminding us both of
a life less complicated.

85
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,806
You know, before all that...

86
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:04,987
Lieutenant-shaped nonsense.

87
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,554
So we can go back to normal.

88
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:09,475
For example, I'm sure you
remember this little ditty.

89
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,517
Come on, take the top line, Detective.

90
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,551
Don't be shy.

91
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,253
Lucifer. For once,

92
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,468
I agree with you, and I
would love nothing more

93
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:19,999
than for things to go back to normal.

94
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:20,932
Oh.

95
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:24,174
As long as it means we
can get back to work.

96
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:25,795
Yes, absolutely.

97
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,624
A mystery waits to be solved.

98
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:29,299
Onwards, Detective.

99
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:31,429
Oh, anyway,

100
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:33,632
I just really want to apologize

101
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:35,522
for ruining your engagement, Chloe.

102
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,858
You know, I-I made it about me

103
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,619
when I should have been
listening to your needs.

104
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,610
You know, what I need is to move on.

105
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:43,480
Agreed. There's no point
dwelling in the past,

106
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:45,046
so let's all move on

107
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:47,866
by moving even further back, shall we?

108
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:50,264
I mean, they're not breast implants,

109
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:52,327
- but in a pinch...
- Oh, oh, oh.

110
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,120
No, no, no. No, no, no. Whoa, whoa!

111
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:55,323
- Whoa... oh!
- Oh!

112
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:56,726
No, no, no. Please
stop. Please stop that.

113
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:58,101
- Thank you.
- Why? What, they're not evidence, are they?

114
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,966
'Cause I wouldn't be the
carefree rogue of yore

115
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:00,846
if they weren't.

116
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,115
Not evidence.

117
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:05,701
- Just priceless historical artifacts.
- Ooh.

118
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:09,639
Okay, this baby right here
is from the World Series.

119
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:12,208
Everyone remembers Gibson's home run,

120
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,010
but Clay...

121
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,978
pitched a shutout in Game
2 that was like, boom!

122
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,025
Take that, bitches.

123
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,883
Hmm.

124
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:25,017
Wait, do you not know
who Forest "King" Clay is?

125
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,123
- No idea.
- Cy Young Award.

126
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,619
World Series MVP.

127
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:30,460
Beloved American legend?

128
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:32,929
Is that lock broken?

129
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:35,632
Ella, you think this
might be a home invasion?

130
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,587
Yeah, I know. I thought
that, too, but unis said

131
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,224
that it didn't look
like anything was taken.

132
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:40,859
Was Devon home alone?

133
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,938
No. Forest was here, too,

134
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:45,608
but medics took him to the
hospital for a head injury.

135
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,619
Apparently the killer
knocked him unconscious.

136
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:48,578
Boom!

137
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,712
Take that, bitches.

138
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,147
Lucifer, what are you doing?

139
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:53,816
Oh, right. You're smoking pot

140
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:56,052
because you smoked
evidence that one time

141
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,400
next to that suspect's car.

142
00:05:57,403 --> 00:05:58,736
Oh, you remember. Yes.

143
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:00,472
And the time at the teen rehab center.

144
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,866
Is it taking you back? It's
taking me, well, somewhere.

145
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:04,728
Can you...

146
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:10,433
Guys.

147
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:12,302
I've got a casing.

148
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:14,968
Oh, well, that is perfect, Detective.

149
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:17,174
My shenanigans leading
to a break in the case?

150
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,445
That is quintessential Deckerstar.

151
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,697
And the eye roll. Now you're getting it.

152
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,799
We did it, Charlotte.

153
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,570
We split up Pierce and Chloe.

154
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:30,340
Yay.

155
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,589
Sorry.

156
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,908
Truth is, I don't feel any different.

157
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,243
And if Hell is definitely based

158
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:39,928
on your own guilt,
then I'm still screwed.

159
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:41,764
Look, we did a good thing.

160
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:44,525
And it's important to
celebrate the tiny victories

161
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,902
- along the way.
- Right.

162
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,517
But how will I know when it's enough,

163
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,139
Amenadiel?

164
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,439
How will you know?

165
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:54,302
Well, we're very different, Charlotte.

166
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:55,704
I'm an angel.

167
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,081
I'll know when my wings are back.

168
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,716
What about until then?

169
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:03,487
Aren't you just as mortal as I am?

170
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:09,159
Well, I su... I suppose you're right.

171
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:13,329
If I were to die right now, I'm...

172
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:16,332
I'm not even sure that
I would go to Heaven.

173
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,368
If that's the case,

174
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,770
then there's definitely no hope for me.

175
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:23,573
That's where faith comes in, Charlotte.

176
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:26,776
Hope in the face of hopelessness.

177
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,444
But faith?

178
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:31,202
Angel or not, what I'm hearing

179
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:33,649
is that you're pretty
much as clueless as I am.

180
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:36,920
Maybe we're not so different, after all.

181
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,663
My God, it's Forest Clay.

182
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:48,731
Who's that?

183
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,791
Ah, it's just some famous athlete

184
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:52,194
whose wife was killed.

185
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,947
That's Forest Clay.

186
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,177
Oh, I didn't have you pegged

187
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,346
as a sports fan.

188
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:02,982
No, from my nightmares.

189
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,385
My Hell loop.

190
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,728
If his wife is dead, he did it.

191
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,674
He's the killer.

192
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:21,510

193
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,471
I was in the kitchen,

194
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,174
eating leftovers.

195
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,777
I saw a reflection on the fridge,

196
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,112
and I thought it was Devon.

197
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,082
But when I turned
around, all I saw was...

198
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:42,087
a gun, a-a mask before
I was hit in the head.

199
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,899
I woke up on the kitchen floor,

200
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:47,826
and I ran to Devon.

201
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,996
But she was, uh...

202
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,733
There was so much blood.

203
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,568
I-I...

204
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,388
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

205
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:00,008
You don't have to do this right now.

206
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:02,173
No, I...

207
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:04,145
I want to.

208
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:07,512
Did you see anything that
could help identify him?

209
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,047
No.

210
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,617
I don't understand who
would do this to Devon.

211
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,653
It was him. Forest killed her.

212
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,989
- Why do you believe that?
- 13 years ago,

213
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,624
I was an associate at Wheeler Law.

214
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,778
I'd only been there for
a few months when my boss,

215
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,463
Ben Sr., shows at my place
in the middle of the night.

216
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:25,891
He handed me a duffel bag.

217
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:26,927
Told me simply

218
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,299
to incinerate it.

219
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,335
He said it was for an important client:

220
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,703
Forest Clay.

221
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:32,804
Well, what was in the bag?

222
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,139
I don't know.

223
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,775
He told me not to open it
or to ask any questions.

224
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,777
And honestly, I didn't want to.

225
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,125
Here's the thing, though.

226
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:42,680
There was dried blood on
the outside of that bag.

227
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,115
I'm certain of it.

228
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,692
Yes, but it's quite a leap to thinking

229
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:48,028
Forest killed someone
then or now, Charlotte.

230
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,437
After years of working
at that firm, I know

231
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,606
how they operate.

232
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,426
Deep down,

233
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,729
I know what I helped
cover up was murder.

234
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,864
I believe her.

235
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,599
Really?

236
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,400
- Mm.
- Why?

237
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,664
Well, which quintessential
response would you like?

238
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,606
The obscure enigmatic one

239
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:07,939
or the blunt nonsensical one?

240
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,441
How about the truth.

241
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:13,391
Well, when Charlotte had her
mini-death, she went to Hell.

242
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:15,113
Forest haunted her Hell loop

243
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,748
and now is haunting her nightmares...

244
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,682
Which, sidebar,

245
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:18,789
Dan is also a part of,

246
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,203
so things are heating up there.

247
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:22,573
Oh, well, that sure is nonsense.

248
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:24,456
Oh, don't worry. The
detective won't believe me.

249
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:26,966
See? It's classic us.

250
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:29,622
Look, I know it sounds far-fetched,

251
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,230
and what Lucifer just
said is flat-out insane.

252
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,734
- Eh.
- Anyway,

253
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:36,450
if Forest killed someone 13 years ago,

254
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:39,170
the odds that he killed
again are not unrealistic.

255
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,359
Please, just look into it.

256
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,241
I will do what I always do,

257
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:47,520
which is investigate everyone involved.

258
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,648
But until I get a new lead,

259
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,364
I will start with Forest.

260
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,036
Textbook, Detective.

261
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,387
Very good.

262
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,261
Brother, what are you doing here?

263
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,539
Personally, I'm avoiding
the, uh, boring forensic part

264
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,013
of the case, like I normally do.

265
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:09,301
But you don't day drink.

266
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:11,302
Something Charlotte said made me think.

267
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:13,204
Oh.

268
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:17,075
Maybe celestial beings and humans...

269
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,644
Luci, maybe they aren't that different.

270
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:21,688
What, are we talking in bed?

271
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:23,591
'Cause we all know my
skills are preternatural.

272
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:24,749
But I suppose you, on the other hand...

273
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,231
I'm talking about the rules
of Heaven and Hell, Luci.

274
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:29,187
It's all based on humans' subconscious,

275
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,789
what they think they deserve.

276
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,325
What if that applies to us as well?

277
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,527
Right. That's enough for you, drunky.

278
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,329
No, listen.

279
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,458
When I first lost my wings,

280
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:41,028
I thought Dad was punishing me.

281
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:44,934
And then I thought that
you were somehow my test,

282
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,680
that in helping God's most
wayward soul, that I would

283
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:49,934
somehow find redemption.

284
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:52,234
But, Luci, I've just been guessing.

285
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:54,071
Dad never told me any of those things.

286
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:56,070
Since when does Dad
ever tell us anything?

287
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:58,073
That's exactly my point, brother.

288
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:00,812
What if He wants us to judge ourselves?

289
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:02,312
So my wings, your wings,

290
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:04,982
your Devil face...

291
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:07,352
Brother, what if

292
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:10,528
we're the ones who control all of it?

293
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,629
Brother,

294
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:15,164
that is absolutely absurd.

295
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,586
Dad holds the reins. End of story.

296
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,419
Because if we do have control,

297
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,711
why don't you just pop
your wings out right now?

298
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:23,562
Hmm? Excuse me.

299
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:26,466
We might need some room
here. Go on. Be an angel.

300
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:27,481
Listen, I'm not sure.

301
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:29,514
I-I still haven't figured that part out.

302
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,983
Well, I'd stop trying if I
were you. It's exhausting.

303
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:35,270
No, actually, on second thoughts,

304
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:37,919
ponder needlessly, 'cause it's
what you normally do, isn't it?

305
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,973
No financial scandals,

306
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,778
no personal accusations.

307
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:53,481
The only nefarious thing Forest
ever did was steal a base.

308
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:55,239
This guy's as squeaky
clean as they come.

309
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,408
Well, someone is

310
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,692
a dirty little liar.

311
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:59,676
I was checking out
Forest's medical report,

312
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,279
and something didn't add up.

313
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,603
He said that the killer knocked
him out with a gun, right?

314
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:04,638
Yeah.

315
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:07,125
Well, bam!

316
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:09,333
Or should I say,

317
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:11,155
no bam?

318
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,405
- Hmm?
- If a cut

319
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,514
is caused by a blunt object,

320
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:18,160
there's a presence of tissue
bridging within the wound.

321
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,730
Plus, there'd be pretty major bruising

322
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,092
if it was caused by something
that knocked him unconscious.

323
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:24,702
- But there was neither.
- So what caused the wound?

324
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,307
That right there, my
friend, is an incised cut

325
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,576
caused by something sharp.

326
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:31,295
Bottom line, Mr. Clay's nose

327
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:33,178
is as long as a Dodger Dog.

328
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:35,179
He lying.

329
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,316
Maybe Charlotte is onto something.

330
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,576
Careful, Mr. Clay.

331
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:49,294
Physical activity may not
be wise after, you know,

332
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,328
being hit on the head.

333
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,501
Detective, hi.

334
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:52,737
What's this about?

335
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,898
Well, Forensics looked
through your medical report.

336
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,701
You weren't hit with a gun.

337
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,852
Well, maybe I didn't see it right.

338
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:00,655
It happened so fast. Maybe it was...

339
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:02,694
Maybe I should just
jump to the old chestnut

340
00:14:02,697 --> 00:14:05,010
where you tell me what you desire.

341
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:12,002
I just don't want anyone to find out.

342
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:13,405
What, that you killed your wife?

343
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:15,787
No, no, no. I... Th-That
I wasn't even there.

344
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,456
Ah.

345
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,894
The night of Devon's murder...

346
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,029
I was with someone else.

347
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,631
Ooh. A mistress.

348
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,035
What was her name?

349
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:31,708
Mia Hytner.

350
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:33,737
I bartend at the West
Hills Country Club.

351
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,358
Okay. And is that how you met Forest?

352
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:39,459
Yes. He came in a lot, even
though he hardly ever drinks.

353
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,112
- Ugh.
- Anyways,

354
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,498
before I knew it, we were...

355
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:43,868
Hitting a home run?

356
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:45,183
Digging into the dugout?

357
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,704
Slamming it out of the park?

358
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,788
So you confirm that you

359
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,036
and Forest were having an affair

360
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:53,405
and that he was at your apartment

361
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:54,975
the night that Devon Clay was murdered?

362
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,428
- Yes.
- And how did he hurt

363
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:58,902
- his head?
- Things can get a little...

364
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:00,471
wild...

365
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:02,608
in bed with us sometimes.

366
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,036
That night, Forest fell

367
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,397
onto the nightstand,

368
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,006
and he shattered the lamp.

369
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:12,006
That would explain the sharp
cut that Ella described.

370
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:13,655
Yes. And furniture-breaking sex

371
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:16,347
doesn't exactly fit with
Forest's saintly image.

372
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,475
- And explain why he lied about it.
- Mm.

373
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:19,851
Try not to judge Forest

374
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:20,985
too harshly.

375
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,150
He wasn't the first

376
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:23,686
to cheat on his marriage.

377
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,514
He would never tell you this,

378
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:29,030
but Devon had been having an
affair with her CEO for years.

379
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,396
Was she, now?

380
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,399
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

381
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:00,303
Only one way to sneak up on a demon.

382
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,382
Let her think she's sneaking up on you.

383
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:04,131
You see, I knew

384
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:06,626
it was only a matter of time
before you found my new digs.

385
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:07,686
Killing me

386
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:09,224
won't send you home.

387
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,556
Keep talking.

388
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,392
The only way you can get to Hell

389
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,134
is if Lucifer flies you down.

390
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:16,098
And the only way he'll do that

391
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,630
is if we destroy his life on Earth.

392
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,986
That's why framing
Lucifer for your murder

393
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:21,689
was the perfect plan.

394
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,792
Until you weaseled your way out of it.

395
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:25,329
Well, I have a new plan. Or, rather,

396
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,065
same plan, different victim.

397
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,968
Who's the new sacrificial lamb?

398
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:30,618
God's favorite son.

399
00:16:36,398 --> 00:16:37,973
You want me to kill Amenadiel?

400
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:39,108
Not exactly.

401
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:40,811
I want you to bring him to me.

402
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:41,908
Alive but weakened.

403
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:43,146
Throw me a soft pitch.

404
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,491
I'll kill him.

405
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:46,294
You want your mark back.

406
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,654
Exactly.

407
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:49,325
There's no better way to piss off God

408
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:51,818
than killing his favorite
son. I get what I want.

409
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,763
Then we frame Lucifer,
and you get what you want.

410
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,544
- It's a win-win.
- Why do you need my help

411
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,215
if you're the one who
has to do the killing?

412
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,466
Well, Amenadiel's angelic
powers might be gone,

413
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:01,943
but he still managed to kill
me nine times when we fought.

414
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,982
Now that I'm mortal...

415
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:05,247
there's no do-overs.

416
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,567
I mean, come on, you're a demon.

417
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,669
He's an angel. This is what you do.

418
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:11,173
Unless your time on Earth
changed you more than I thought

419
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:13,511
and you're not the merciless
badass you used to be.

420
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:18,926
Nothing's changed.

421
00:17:18,928 --> 00:17:20,161
I'm in.

422
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:37,619
Devon was the heart
and soul of King Clay.

423
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:39,380
I can't tell you how hard it's been.

424
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:41,216
Emphasis on the "hard."

425
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:42,950
- Excuse me?
- We have reason to believe

426
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:45,419
that you were having an
affair with Devon Clay.

427
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:46,453
That's crazy.

428
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:47,655
Look, I get it.

429
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,113
Being with a married woman,

430
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:50,683
knowing she could
never leave her husband

431
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:52,950
because of some stupid company,

432
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:54,436
his giant face staring down

433
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:56,205
at you all day. I
mean, it can be torture

434
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,499
working side by side with somebody
that you have feelings for.

435
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:02,208
Especially if you have to deny
those feelings, squash 'em.

436
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:04,161
You know, it can be unbearable.

437
00:18:04,164 --> 00:18:05,521
Yeah.

438
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:07,029
It sounds awful.

439
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:09,432
But that was not the
situation with me and Devon.

440
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,693
We were just putting in a
lot of hours at the office.

441
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:13,796
We have to hit the shelves
before the knockoffs do.

442
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,799
Corporate espionage is a real thing.

443
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:18,269
Actually caught a spy casing
this place just the other day.

444
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:20,013
Really? Did you press charges?

445
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,435
Unfortunately, no. He ran off

446
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:23,456
- when security approached him.
- Did it occur to you

447
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,083
that he might be stalking
Devon and not your sneakers?

448
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,536
No, God. Do you think...

449
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,140
I think I'm gonna need to see
all of your security footage.

450
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,479
Yeah. Right this way.

451
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,575
Dr. Canaan.

452
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,365
Pleasure.

453
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:43,701
My office is right this way.

454
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:46,482
I really hope you
understand just how grave

455
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:49,362
the incident was. You're
in experienced hands.

456
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:52,247
The firm handles cases
like this all the time.

457
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,450
Really?

458
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:54,513
Oh, yeah.

459
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:57,380
How many cases of misdiagnosed
chlamydia are there?

460
00:18:57,383 --> 00:19:00,218
You'd be... surprised?

461
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,755
I'm not going anywhere.

462
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:03,725
- Get out of my way.
- Excuse me one moment.

463
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:05,029
Not until I talk to Wheeler!

464
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:08,013
- Ben!
- Charlotte, what-what's going on?

465
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,458
When I left this firm,

466
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:10,927
you asked me why.

467
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,095
The truth?

468
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:13,575
It's because I found out

469
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:17,514
that there are real consequences
to what you're doing here,

470
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:19,583
what we did here.

471
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:21,048
You tell yourself

472
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,884
that you're defending the innocent,

473
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:27,922
upholding some oath,
but you're pretending.

474
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:29,623
All of you.

475
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:34,128
Everything you conceal,
every lie you tell,

476
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,397
it adds up.

477
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,333
You're just as guilty

478
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:41,102
as the criminals that you represent.

479
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:42,636
Hell is real.

480
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:47,052
And, trust me, all of you are going.

481
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:50,144
You need help, Charlotte.

482
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:51,645
And so do I.

483
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,857
Where the hell is security?

484
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,259
Thank God.

485
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,930
I don't think God's on your side, Ben.

486
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,686
It may be too late for us,

487
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:03,290
but at least I'm trying to fix things.

488
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:06,185
Maybe you can try, too.

489
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:14,635
Oh.

490
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:17,238
My apologies for the
interruption, Dr. Canaan.

491
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,906
Shall we continue?

492
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:22,344
Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't
think this is the firm for me.

493
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,419
Old password still good?

494
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:32,988
Sure is.

495
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,922
Got him.

496
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:41,115
Four separate times,
as a matter of fact.

497
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:43,811
But our facial recognition
software's coming up with squat

498
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:45,729
because of his hat and sunglasses.

499
00:20:45,731 --> 00:20:47,170
Average height,

500
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:49,533
average build, no
visible scars or tattoos.

501
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,168
I mean, even his shoes are so boring.

502
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,522
Mm, no wonder he's
stealing sneaker secrets.

503
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,155
I'll go back over the footage
tonight. Maybe we missed something.

504
00:20:57,242 --> 00:20:59,242
You Dan Espinoza?

505
00:20:59,244 --> 00:21:00,744
How dare you.

506
00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:02,946
Hey, hey. Actually, uh, that's for me.

507
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:04,281
Whew.

508
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:06,826
- Ah. Well, this is like old times, isn't it?
- Thanks.

509
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:08,529
Let me guess, human head or bomb?

510
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:09,733
Wager, anyone?

511
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:10,768
Funny.

512
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,131
No. This is

513
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:14,867
for...

514
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,514
Charlotte.

515
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,225
Ta-da!

516
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:21,504
It's a waffle maker.

517
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:23,039
See,

518
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:24,776
I-I make waffles.

519
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:27,103
And hers... uh, iron is really old.

520
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:30,007
I'm, like, the waffle king?

521
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:31,842
- Is it weird?
- Very. But I'm glad

522
00:21:31,844 --> 00:21:34,544
to see you're back to your
normal douchey ways, Daniel.

523
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:37,614
Well, it's between that and...

524
00:21:37,616 --> 00:21:39,517
this.

525
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:41,852
That's pretty.

526
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,584
- It's a waffle.
- Oh.

527
00:21:43,587 --> 00:21:45,409
- That's better, right?
- It's still weird,

528
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,373
but yes, women tend to prefer jewelry

529
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:48,925
over household appliances.

530
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,727
Not really sure Lucifer's

531
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:52,963
the authority on what women want.

532
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:01,917
This is amazing. See this?

533
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,840
These are nondisclosure agreements.

534
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:05,483
Forest Clay and...

535
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:07,052
14 different women.

536
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:09,659
Spanning two decades...
The last, Mia Hytner,

537
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,148
barely a week ago.

538
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,051
Question: How does this prove
that Forest is the killer, though?

539
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:17,241
Well, 300, 400 grand a
pop... I mean, no one spends

540
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:19,321
that kind of money unless
they're trying to cover up

541
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:21,159
something really bad.

542
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,260
Wait.

543
00:22:23,262 --> 00:22:25,829
Joanne Foles.

544
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:29,306
June 22, 2005. That's
right around the time

545
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:32,040
I got rid of the duffel bag. I remember.

546
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,783
"24-year-old found
strangled in a motel."

547
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:39,001
No way the timing is coincidence.

548
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:41,163
Forest killed that
woman, and the proof of it

549
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,366
- was in that duffel bag.
- Yeah,

550
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:44,189
but not even one mention of Forest here.

551
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:45,722
Yeah, you're right.

552
00:22:45,725 --> 00:22:47,491
I may know that Forest did it,

553
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:49,867
but I still can't prove
it because of what I did.

554
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:50,853
Hey, at least

555
00:22:50,856 --> 00:22:53,439
we have the victim's name
now... Maybe that's gonna lead us

556
00:22:53,442 --> 00:22:54,806
to some other proof.

557
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:58,311
Tiny victories, remember?

558
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,494
- Hey.
- Dan.

559
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:03,993
I can come back.

560
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:05,496
No, no. I should get going.

561
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:10,308
Thank you.

562
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:14,846
Hi.

563
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:23,188
Maze.

564
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:25,759
What are you doing here? What's wrong?

565
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:31,294
Everything.

566
00:23:31,296 --> 00:23:34,030
It's all ruined.

567
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:36,399
I have no one, Amenadiel.

568
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:38,822
And I don't know how that happened.

569
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,819
Maze, I don't know what
you've been going through,

570
00:23:46,822 --> 00:23:49,400
but it is never too late

571
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:51,338
to fix things.

572
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:57,014
You can always

573
00:23:57,017 --> 00:23:59,756
be forgiven... that is in your hands.

574
00:23:59,758 --> 00:24:01,658
And, um...

575
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,894
well, for what it's worth,

576
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:06,189
I will always be here for you.

577
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,108
Hello.

578
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,409
Hi, Lucifer!

579
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:21,639
Oh, perfect... you're
exactly where you need to be.

580
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:24,247
Who is up for a classic game night, hmm?

581
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:26,349
Well, actually, it's
a school night for her,

582
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:27,915
and I was just about to go over

583
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:30,219
- the King Clay security footage.
- Remember, all work

584
00:24:30,222 --> 00:24:33,584
and no play makes the
detective... a shoe.

585
00:24:33,587 --> 00:24:35,189
- Lucifer?
- Hmm?

586
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:36,660
This is... this is a little weird.

587
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:38,528
Well, if by "weird," you
mean you're transported

588
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,731
to a simpler, happier time, then agreed.

589
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:45,935
Uh, no, no, no, I'm afraid
that won't do... you landed

590
00:24:45,938 --> 00:24:48,672
on the little question mark
last time, so come on, do over.

591
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:52,655
Mom's right, this is
weird... We can't play

592
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,278
the exact same game as
we did before, Lucifer.

593
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,813
It's not fun.

594
00:24:56,815 --> 00:24:58,267
Isn't it?

595
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,349
Sorry, but...

596
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:01,184
I should finish my book report.

597
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:03,162
Yes, and I should get back to work.

598
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:06,189
But don't you want to
paint a unicorn on my cheek?

599
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:07,233
Well, hold on, wait.

600
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:09,291
- Um...
- There we go.

601
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:12,596
- Okay. What?
- Come here. Come here.

602
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:13,630
Lucifer!

603
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:15,131
What are you doing?

604
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,420
Here we go.

605
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:21,204
Wait.

606
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:22,706
Lucifer, stop.

607
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,941
You liked this before, didn't you?

608
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:27,451
Yes. I did.

609
00:25:27,454 --> 00:25:28,778
It...

610
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,491
it meant a lot to me, actually,

611
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:34,400
which is why I don't understand
why you're doing this.

612
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:37,608
Are you making fun of us?

613
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:41,725
No. No, I'm trying to remind
us of how great we are together,

614
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:43,293
to help us get back to normal.

615
00:25:43,295 --> 00:25:44,594
Right.

616
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:48,331
Well, uh, you know, I
thought I wanted that, too,

617
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,633
but...

618
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:51,116
maybe we can't.

619
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,428
Or at least maybe I can't.

620
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:54,998
Look...

621
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:56,600
right now,

622
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:59,353
normal, it just hurts.

623
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:01,457
Detective...

624
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,581
I-I think you should go.

625
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:10,490
Hey, I got something.

626
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:11,954
- You do?
- Yeah.

627
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:13,193
Okay, I cross-referenced

628
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,124
the times the suspect went to King Clay

629
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:16,325
with Devon's schedule.

630
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:19,061
Two of the four days,
Devon wasn't even there.

631
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:20,462
But guess who was.

632
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,607
- Forest Clay?
- All four times

633
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,234
the skulker was there...
Right on Forest's heels.

634
00:26:25,236 --> 00:26:28,073
So what if Forest was the
intended target all along?

635
00:26:28,076 --> 00:26:30,698
What if, what if Devon
just got shot by mistake?

636
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:32,107
Wow.

637
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:34,109
That is a great theory.

638
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:37,123
- Yeah.
- Uh, are you okay?

639
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:38,314
Yeah.

640
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:39,615
Yeah.

641
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:42,143
Well, I... I couldn't sleep last night,

642
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:44,353
so I stayed up all night
working, and, you know,

643
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:46,689
I drank a lot of caffeine. Like, a lot.

644
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:49,021
Was it because of Pierce?

645
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:52,528
No.

646
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,096
No. I... I don't think any of this

647
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:58,233
is really about Pierce.

648
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:02,204
I think if I'm honest with myself...

649
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:05,040
all of this is about Lucifer.

650
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,409
Lucifer's the... the reason

651
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:09,411
that I said yes to Pierce, and...

652
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:12,114
he's also the reason that I said no.

653
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:15,474
Wow, again.

654
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:18,519
I'm just so sorry that I got wrapped up

655
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:21,026
in the whole idea of
beautiful "Pecker" babies

656
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:23,359
that I forgot to check in with you.

657
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:26,420
Like... like, really check in with you.

658
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:27,895
- Ella, it's okay.
- Tell me

659
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:29,631
what I can do for you right now.

660
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:32,034
Uh, you can help me focus on work.

661
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:33,448
- You got it.
- Okay.

662
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:37,971
So, if Forest was the
killer's actual target,

663
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:39,108
what's the motive?

664
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,642
I think I know.

665
00:27:40,644 --> 00:27:43,393
That's A.J. Agholor.

666
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:45,253
In 2005, he went to jail

667
00:27:45,256 --> 00:27:46,915
for the murder of Joanne Foles.

668
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,150
But A.J. didn't do it.

669
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:51,388
Forest did. A.J.'s motive was revenge.

670
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:52,890
How did you figure all of this out?

671
00:27:52,893 --> 00:27:56,357
This is a list of women that Forest
paid off for the last 20 years.

672
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,760
And look.

673
00:27:57,762 --> 00:28:02,268
Joanne signed a $300,000 NDA on June 22.

674
00:28:02,271 --> 00:28:04,233
She was killed on June 25,

675
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:06,602
- the same night I got the bag.
- Charlotte,

676
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:08,303
this could all be a
bunch of coincidences,

677
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:10,440
especially to a jury
full of Forest Clay fans.

678
00:28:10,443 --> 00:28:13,142
Yes, but a lot of
coincidences is a pattern.

679
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:14,773
And here's the kicker.

680
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,044
A.J. got out of prison
just three weeks ago.

681
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:20,010
Motive and opportunity.

682
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:21,250
It all fits.

683
00:28:21,252 --> 00:28:24,019
All right. We got to find this guy.

684
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,199
Where's Amenadiel?

685
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:39,501
I decided you were wrong.

686
00:28:39,503 --> 00:28:41,888
Killing Amenadiel won't
get your mark back.

687
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:43,396
God isn't a drive-thru...

688
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:46,007
You can't just order what you want.

689
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,810
No.

690
00:28:47,812 --> 00:28:51,256
You chickened out. Gone
soft, like I thought.

691
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:53,193
Know what? I'll do it myself.

692
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:56,881
Where do you think you're going?

693
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:05,021
How's that for soft?

694
00:29:07,698 --> 00:29:10,209
We found this in your car, A.J.

695
00:29:10,212 --> 00:29:13,547
It matches the casing that was
found next to Devon Clay's body.

696
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,123
Now, I don't think you
meant to kill Devon.

697
00:29:16,126 --> 00:29:19,693
I don't. I think that you were
following Forest for weeks,

698
00:29:19,696 --> 00:29:22,170
you broke into his house when
you knew he'd be home alone,

699
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:23,178
only he wasn't...

700
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:24,999
Devon surprised you. You panicked,

701
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:26,502
and you shot her.

702
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:28,885
You've been in prison for 13 years

703
00:29:28,888 --> 00:29:31,719
for a crime you didn't commit.

704
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:34,334
It's understandable that
you would want revenge.

705
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:36,937
Yeah. But not for me.

706
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,574
For Joanie.

707
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:42,154
We were gonna get
married. She broke it off.

708
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,823
- For Forest?
- Yeah.

709
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:46,660
Only she didn't tell me
that was his name back then.

710
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:47,762
She was too scared.

711
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:48,849
Scared?

712
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:51,786
He used to hurt her.

713
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,923
She said she was gonna leave him.

714
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:57,928
Then one night, she calls
me crying, screaming.

715
00:29:57,931 --> 00:30:01,166
Next thing I knew, I'm
going down for murder.

716
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:04,103
- When did you find out that it was Forest?
- When I got out of jail,

717
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:06,003
I went to go see Joanie's mom.

718
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:08,923
She told me that's who Joanie
was dating when she died.

719
00:30:08,926 --> 00:30:11,990
Did she, or you, have any proof?

720
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:13,193
Mm-mm.

721
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:14,607
Damn.

722
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,990
More hearsay.

723
00:30:16,993 --> 00:30:18,694
Ah, Charlotte.

724
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:24,406
Who's that?

725
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,342
He killed Devon Clay.

726
00:30:26,344 --> 00:30:27,890
Long story.

727
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:31,128
So the detective caught the bad guy.

728
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:32,396
Without me.

729
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,165
All right, thank you.

730
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:36,503
Yeah, he's not the real bad guy.

731
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:40,556
Thank you.

732
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:42,756
I know you're gonna say
there's still no proof.

733
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,560
No, I wanted to say thank you.

734
00:30:44,562 --> 00:30:46,760
Thank you for helping
me solve this case.

735
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,833
And I might have an idea
of how to solve yours.

736
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,483
Okay. Time out. Time out.

737
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:09,709
Geez. I won't go after Amenadiel.

738
00:31:09,712 --> 00:31:10,803
You won't?

739
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:13,342
You're probably right...
it wouldn't work anyway.

740
00:31:34,712 --> 00:31:37,913
I had to kill you before,
but now I just want to.

741
00:31:37,915 --> 00:31:40,670
Okay, you could kill me,
sure, but Linda would die, too.

742
00:31:40,673 --> 00:31:42,040
- You're full of it.
- Maybe I knew

743
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:43,419
you weren't gonna follow through,

744
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:44,887
so I needed a fail-safe.

745
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:45,921
Liar!

746
00:31:45,923 --> 00:31:48,810
Call her. Tell her to
look out her window.

747
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,001
Now I'm...

748
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:01,553
really gonna kill you.

749
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:17,334
Hey, get me a beer, will ya?

750
00:32:26,764 --> 00:32:27,896
Hello, Forest.

751
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:30,021
Charlotte Richards,
what are you doing here?

752
00:32:30,024 --> 00:32:31,854
Oh, I just stopped by to tell you

753
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:33,502
that I know about everything.

754
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:36,472
Everyone, actually.

755
00:32:36,474 --> 00:32:38,763
Stephanie, Diane, Jaylyn...

756
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:41,326
about every woman that you abused

757
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:42,467
and then paid off.

758
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,637
Most recently, Mia, of course.

759
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,406
She told me how you actually got

760
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:47,875
that cut on your head.

761
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:49,751
I told her how you were
getting rough again.

762
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:52,488
How you started to strangle me.

763
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,873
I tried to get you to
stop, but you wouldn't.

764
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:57,442
So I pushed you.

765
00:32:57,445 --> 00:32:59,381
And you hit your head against the lamp.

766
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:05,600
How much do you want?

767
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:06,693
Money?

768
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:07,756
Well, a pattern

769
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:10,872
of domestic abuse going
back decades is pretty bad.

770
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,834
But murder?

771
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:16,004
Whew, let's see, carry the one...

772
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:18,081
Yeah, all of it.

773
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:20,154
Murder? What are you talking about?

774
00:33:20,157 --> 00:33:23,317
Joanne Foles. Ring a bell?

775
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,921
You can stop pretending, Forest.

776
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:27,156
Cat's out of the bag.

777
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:30,503
Or rather, the bloody duffel bag.

778
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:34,797
Yeah, you remember giving
that to Ben Sr., right?

779
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,598
Well, see, hmm,

780
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,667
he gave it to his young

781
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:42,938
and hungry first-year associate: me.

782
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,854
And here's the thing, I kept it.

783
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:50,807
I thought it might
come in handy someday.

784
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,916
I'll get my check book.

785
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:57,253
Turns out I'm a pretty smart lady.

786
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,258
Not that smart.

787
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:08,172
Knock, knock. It's Lucifer.

788
00:34:08,175 --> 00:34:10,271
Come to save the day.

789
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:12,485
Everybody stay calm.

790
00:34:12,488 --> 00:34:13,820
Just get back and I mean it.

791
00:34:13,823 --> 00:34:14,822
I mean it!

792
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:16,092
Forest, let her go.

793
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:20,783
Hey, I didn't mean to kill Joanie.

794
00:34:20,785 --> 00:34:23,052
It was an accident.

795
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:25,255
I'm sick. I need your help.

796
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:27,756
Thanks for your help.

797
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:31,327
I am not gonna help you this time.

798
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:32,578
Hands up.

799
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:33,948
Let her go, Forest.

800
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:38,063
Was that enough of a
confession, Detective?

801
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:39,934
Yes. We recorded everything.

802
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:42,430
It's over, Forest.

803
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:43,672
Let her go.

804
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:51,147
Turn around.

805
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:06,829
Wow.

806
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:08,727
It's a good place to celebrate.

807
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,130
Yes, it is.

808
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:13,344
I have been coming here
ever since I realized

809
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:15,948
that this may be the closest

810
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:18,285
to Heaven that I'll ever get.

811
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:21,489
Hmm.

812
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:23,859
Me, too.

813
00:35:23,862 --> 00:35:25,995
You know, I've been telling myself

814
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,446
that I've been doing God's work.

815
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:30,519
But, uh, if I'm honest...

816
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:33,222
I think I've been
doing it all for myself.

817
00:35:33,224 --> 00:35:36,726
To get my Father to
give me my wings back.

818
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,110
But you know something,
Charlotte? I think, uh...

819
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:48,071
I think I'm the one
who took my wings away.

820
00:35:48,074 --> 00:35:50,883
Great. We're both broken.

821
00:35:52,455 --> 00:35:53,754
Yeah.

822
00:35:53,757 --> 00:35:57,826
Well, I guess angels really
are just as flawed as humans,

823
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:59,797
or at least I am.

824
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,201
Hey, at least we have each other.

825
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:05,138
Tiny victories, right?

826
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:06,655
Tiny?

827
00:36:06,657 --> 00:36:09,024
Uh, may I point out

828
00:36:09,026 --> 00:36:11,392
that you just stopped a serial abuser?

829
00:36:11,395 --> 00:36:12,575
A murderer.

830
00:36:12,578 --> 00:36:14,497
Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact

831
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:18,701
that he hurt a lot of women.

832
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:20,836
No.

833
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:24,306
But because of you...

834
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:28,680
he will never hurt anyone ever again.

835
00:36:28,683 --> 00:36:30,816
And I'm pretty sure
that you didn't do that

836
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:34,313
just for yourself, did you?

837
00:36:37,421 --> 00:36:39,743
Maybe not.

838
00:37:15,493 --> 00:37:17,160
Well done, Detective.

839
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:24,943
And, uh, point taken.

840
00:37:24,946 --> 00:37:26,802
What do you mean?

841
00:37:26,804 --> 00:37:29,506
Well, you put away not
one, but two bad guys today.

842
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:30,771
All without my help.

843
00:37:30,774 --> 00:37:34,476
So it's become very clear that you...

844
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:36,312
well, you don't need me.

845
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:37,580
That's okay, Detective,

846
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:40,249
because with that realization

847
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:41,750
came another.

848
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:43,203
Hmm.

849
00:37:43,206 --> 00:37:45,119
If you don't need me,

850
00:37:45,122 --> 00:37:47,489
then we've been working together

851
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:49,792
all this time because you want to.

852
00:37:49,794 --> 00:37:54,063
Because you choose to.

853
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:57,846
You did choose me.

854
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:59,982
You were right.

855
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:02,920
I've been trying to go
back to the way things were.

856
00:38:02,923 --> 00:38:04,709
You know, playing our greatest hits,

857
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:07,109
because I've been avoiding dealing

858
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:09,812
with things in the present like...

859
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:11,748
how I feel about you.

860
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:16,209
I was afraid.

861
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:17,987
Afraid...

862
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:22,157
that you'd want me 'cause you've
only seen certain sides of me.

863
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,360
That if you saw all of me...

864
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:29,731
knew all of me,

865
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:31,767
you would run away.

866
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:33,071
Lucifer.

867
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:35,271
- Detective, it's true.
- No.

868
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:38,209
The other side of me is... it's bad.

869
00:38:38,212 --> 00:38:41,271
It's monstrous, even.

870
00:38:41,274 --> 00:38:44,865
But you wanted the truth,
and you deserve the truth.

871
00:38:44,868 --> 00:38:46,600
Right now, I can't show it to you,

872
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:49,852
so I'm just gonna have to tell you.

873
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:51,985
Detective...

874
00:38:57,561 --> 00:39:01,157
Chloe...

875
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,946
I am the Devil.

876
00:39:07,017 --> 00:39:08,640
No, you're not.

877
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:12,642
Not to me.

878
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:28,023
Oh. Oh.

879
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:29,591
Let me turn this off.

880
00:39:29,593 --> 00:39:30,793
Right.

881
00:39:30,795 --> 00:39:32,429
Oh.

882
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:35,798
Oh, it's...

883
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,634
I'm so sorry. I have to take this.

884
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:39,438
Of course, no.

885
00:39:40,538 --> 00:39:43,739
Yeah.

886
00:39:45,813 --> 00:39:48,777
Detective, what's wrong?

887
00:39:53,484 --> 00:39:56,018
Hey, just hold on, Charlotte.

888
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,121
I'm, uh, I'm gonna get help.

889
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:03,325
I already survived death once.

890
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:07,615
I think twice is asking too... too much.

891
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:09,264
No. You're gonna be okay.

892
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:16,873
Why did you do that?

893
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:20,275
Why did you jump in
front of me like that?

894
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:23,951
It wasn't for myself,
that's for damn sure.

895
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:38,192
Will you s-stay with me?

896
00:40:38,195 --> 00:40:40,062
Yes.

897
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:42,064
Yes, I promise.

898
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,943
Let's go home.

899
