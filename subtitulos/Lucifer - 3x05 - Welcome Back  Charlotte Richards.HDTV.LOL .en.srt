1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,183
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:04,724
Someone's escaped from Hell.

3
00:00:04,726 --> 00:00:06,289
- Who has escaped Hell?
- Mum.

4
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:08,536
All I've wanted is to reunite our family.

5
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:09,843
I don't understand you.

6
00:00:09,846 --> 00:00:11,654
All right, whatever this is between us.

7
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:13,754
- I like you.
- What is she doing here?

8
00:00:13,757 --> 00:00:15,992
Charlotte Richards,
the defense attorney.

9
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,527
It appears you've been busy.

10
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:19,495
I thought I'd dive into my employment.

11
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:21,564
It's not that hard once
you read the law books.

12
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:22,599
So, what happened?

13
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:24,375
Well, I cut a hole in space and time,

14
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:26,340
Mum's light flooded through
it, then it closed up

15
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:27,403
behind her. All good.

16
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:29,205
- Mom is gone?
- Yes.

17
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:31,390
What is going on? Who are you?

18
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:33,376
Detective, are you okay?

19
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:35,578
Yeah, I'm fine. I mean,
thanks to Lieutenant Pierce.

20
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,546
He saved my life.

21
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:37,714
But don't worry, pal.

22
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:38,934
Luckily, Pierce was with her.

23
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:40,203
But I wasn't.

24
00:00:42,156 --> 00:00:46,022
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

25
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:49,526
Mmm!

26
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:53,763
Mmm, mmm. Mmm? Mmm!

27
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:57,963
Simon.

28
00:00:57,966 --> 00:00:59,132
Working late, huh?

29
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:00,801
Orders went up again.

30
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:02,038
Got to make another batch.

31
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,929
Hmm.

32
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:05,078
If you don't eat it all first, Lalo.

33
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,879
Have fun cooking.

34
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:44,280
Hello?

35
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:49,018
Somebody there?

36
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,711
Oh, hell.

37
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:15,945
Trixie.

38
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:18,781
But, Mom, I lost Wonder Woman's lasso!

39
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:20,497
No excuses.

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,818
You know the rules.

41
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,053
Ah, good morning,

42
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:26,055
- Detective.
- Child.

43
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:27,790
Your text said to meet you here.

44
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,317
Yeah, I don't think it said to
barge in like you own the place.

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,694
Anyhow,

46
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,062
Pierce called from the hospital.

47
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:34,664
Because apparently he
never stops working.

48
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,865
But we have a new case.

49
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:37,934
What, "The Case of the
Missing Bedpan"? Riveting.

50
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:39,235
No, an actual case.

51
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:40,750
So, let's get moving.

52
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:42,939
Ah. Well, hello.

53
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:45,020
"Swear Jar"?

54
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:46,209
Oh, yes.

55
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,677
Trixie's...

56
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:50,332
You give your child money
every time she swears?

57
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:52,457
Oh, bravo, Detective.

58
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,217
No, no, no. She pays

59
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,518
for every bad word she says.

60
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,387
Ah, well, then I'm even more impressed.

61
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,578
Really? Thank you, Lucifer.

62
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:02,015
Impressed that you extort
money from your offspring.

63
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:03,950
I mean, what a ridiculous idea.

64
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:04,961
"Bad" words.

65
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:07,263
Determined by a set of arbitrary rules.

66
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:08,698
Just like my Father's.

67
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,299
Here, child.

68
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:12,335
This should buy you
plenty of juicy words.

69
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:13,840
- You swear away.
- Here, Trixie.

70
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:16,839
I am trying to get her to stop swearing

71
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:18,007
and teach her accountability.

72
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,709
- Ever heard of it?
- Yes,

73
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:21,277
I have, actually, and I happen to think

74
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,780
accountability is overrated.

75
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:25,981
I mean, take your almost
getting shot at the ranch.

76
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:26,965
At first, I felt bad

77
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:28,584
I wasn't there to protect you.

78
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:30,507
Eh, what?

79
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,114
You shouldn't have felt bad.

80
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:34,190
Exactly.

81
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:35,793
Because accountability is overrated.

82
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:37,879
No, because you don't
need to protect me.

83
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,462
And it wasn't your fault to begin with.

84
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:40,530
You're right.

85
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:41,497
It was my Dad's fault.

86
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:43,281
- Oh... what?
- I mean, I'm sure

87
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:45,802
it was Him manipulating
things like He always does.

88
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,898
Try to teach me a lesson
about responsibility

89
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,500
or some nonsense like that.

90
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:51,607
Right, because that makes
more sense than someone

91
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,743
shooting at me because I
was about to arrest him.

92
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:54,777
I know!

93
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:57,013
And I am so over Him getting in my head,

94
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,881
so, as of today, I have decided

95
00:03:58,883 --> 00:04:01,884
I shall no longer be affected
by my Father's shenanigans.

96
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:04,053
Really? Why do I doubt that?

97
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:05,057
But...

98
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,792
Trixie, money in the
jar, then off to school.

99
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:11,394
Uh, child,

100
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:14,088
before you do that...

101
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:26,576
Oy vay.

102
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:28,711
Someone forgot to exfoliate.

103
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:32,448
Victim's name is Simon Fisher, 42.

104
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,991
Senior food chemist for
Performance Pudding Plus.

105
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:36,919
And apparently

106
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:38,521
a very clumsy one.

107
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:40,112
This wasn't an accident.

108
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:42,425
The irregular scuff marks,
those indicate a struggle.

109
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:44,227
Ella's working on cause of death.

110
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:46,249
Well, he obviously drowned
in this vat of semen.

111
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,830
It's pudding, Lucifer.

112
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:50,166
Sure, I've heard it called that, too.

113
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:51,710
Poor dude didn't drown.

114
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:54,136
And, aside from his
Freddy Krueger makeover,

115
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:56,172
no other wounds, so,

116
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:58,441
my money's on death by scalding.

117
00:04:58,443 --> 00:04:59,866
- Oh.
- Can't be sure, though,

118
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:01,878
until we get him
cleaned up and autopsied.

119
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,155
Well, I'm sure our resident
pudding fan must be loving this.

120
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:06,890
Don't even joke, man.

121
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:08,818
Pudding Plus is my favorite, okay?

122
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,421
Twice as much protein
as all the other brands.

123
00:05:12,423 --> 00:05:14,524
Now with twice as much dead guy.

124
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:15,825
Who found the body?

125
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,059
I feel terrible.

126
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,561
If only I hadn't been

127
00:05:18,563 --> 00:05:19,529
in the bathroom so long,

128
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:20,968
maybe I would have heard something,

129
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:22,127
seen something.

130
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,623
Maybe I could have prevented this.

131
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:26,368
Quite a lot of security
just for pudding.

132
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:27,670
It's big business.

133
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:30,206
Thanks to the secret
recipe that Simon created.

134
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,042
Can't just let anyone
peek behind the curtain.

135
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:34,744
- Right.
- Well, we need to.

136
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:37,202
So, can you give us the access
to your security footage?

137
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:38,748
That's above my pay grade.

138
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,750
You'd have to talk to
the big man upstairs.

139
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:42,451
God?

140
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:44,546
Uh, no. The company's owner.

141
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:46,956
Oh. Right.

142
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,768
His boss.

143
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,462
How can I even eat this
after what I've seen?

144
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,933
Is someone trying to tell me something?

145
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:59,802
Well, if He is, don't
let Him inside your head.

146
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:01,971
Learn from my mistakes, Daniel.

147
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,072
Lucifer.

148
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,907
- Yeah?
- Adrian Yates,

149
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,108
the CEO of Pudding Plus,

150
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,243
is in the conference room.

151
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:08,678
He brought his security tapes.

152
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,812
Oh, excellent.

153
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:12,048
Who says solving murders can't be easy?

154
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,552
Mr. Yates, thank you for coming.

155
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:19,589
Your security footage
will be incredibly helpful.

156
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:21,057
Did you bring the tapes?

157
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,592
Sorry, but no.

158
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,126
What? Why not?

159
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:26,462
Because I told him not to.

160
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:27,797
I'm Mr. Yates' attorney

161
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:31,267
and the LAPD isn't laying
a finger on those tapes.

162
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:35,377
Mum?

163
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,143


164
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:40,134
You are not crazy.

165
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:43,470
No one knows you can't
remember the last few months.

166
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:46,073
You will pretend that you do.

167
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:48,142
Own it.

168
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:53,280
You will not...

169
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:56,267
not give them a reason to
put you in a padded cell.

170
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:00,587
You look surprised to see me.

171
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,691
Charlotte,

172
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:08,064
we... just didn't expect
to see you so soon.

173
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:11,198
Thought your brush with
death might have changed you.

174
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,499
It has.

175
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:14,768
Hasn't it?

176
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,503
Back to being Charlotte Richards?

177
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:18,338
Right?

178
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,507
- Why are you here?
- Apparently,

179
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:23,577
someone was trying to speak
to my client without counsel.

180
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:26,547
I am here to inform you that
a stunt like that won't stand,

181
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,626
nor will your request
for any security footage.

182
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:31,585
We just wanted Mr. Yates' help.

183
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:33,087
A friendly conversation,

184
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,355
but this makes it seem like
you're hiding something.

185
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:36,509
Yes.

186
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:38,926
An ulterior motive for
being here, perhaps?

187
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:39,939
Excuse me?

188
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:42,196
It's awfully curious
timing, you back in my life

189
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:43,697
with everything that's happening.

190
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:48,669
This is about me, isn't it?

191
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:52,807
If this was a social visit,
you would most certainly know.

192
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,443
And what we're hiding is Pudding Plus'

193
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:58,178
proprietary recipe.

194
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,847
Releasing those tapes would reveal

195
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:01,048
how their pudding is made,

196
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,051
committing their secret
formula to public record,

197
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:06,017
which could cost the company millions.

198
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,018
Besides, the killer's not
on any of the footage anyway.

199
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,626
Mr. Yates, it's best
if I do the talking.

200
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:12,091
But all that you can see is
that there's some sort of scuffle

201
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,251
out of frame. The killer's

202
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:15,062
not visible from any of the angles.

203
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:16,530
Okay, so, see, that there.

204
00:09:16,532 --> 00:09:18,465
That's a clue. That means the killer

205
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,681
knew how to avoid the cameras.

206
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,169
This could be an inside job.

207
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:23,674
Who-who has access to the lab?

208
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:25,077
I'm assuming you're at
the top of that list.

209
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:27,307
All right, Detective,
you can stop right there.

210
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,842
Mr. Yates, not a word.

211
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:30,611
We're done here.

212
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,413
But, I'm not done with you.

213
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:36,750
Which part of my briefcase
closing do you not understand?

214
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:38,018
Uh...

215
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:41,854
Still waiting for Pudding Man's autopsy.

216
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:44,358
Cleaning that tasty treat
off a boiled corpse...

217
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,193
Tougher than you'd imagine.

218
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:48,053
I'd rather not imagine, actually.

219
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:49,329
Adrian, I'm telling...

220
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:51,932
Oh, hey,

221
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:54,162
let's go somewhere that's not here,

222
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:56,199
like... over there.

223
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:57,939
I hear over there is really nice.

224
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:02,276
Hi.

225
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:03,564
Hello.

226
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:12,197
Did you see that?

227
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:17,624
She barely even looked at me.

228
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:20,029
It's like she's a
completely different person.

229
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:22,162
Yes, very perceptive, Daniel.

230
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,498
What worries me is: Why is she here?

231
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,099
What's her angle?

232
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:30,904
Dude, I cannot deal with
your weirdness right now.

233
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:32,506
Yeah.

234
00:10:35,144 --> 00:10:37,444
First A.D.!

235
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,947
So, I found seven Pudding Plus employees

236
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:41,815
with keycard access to the lab.

237
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:45,118
Unfortunately, all seven,
including Adrian Yates,

238
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,020
- have solid alibis.
- You don't say.

239
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,456
But I did find one other
person with a keycard,

240
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,960
an old one... Adrian's former
business partner, Grace Foley.

241
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:54,795
She left the company two years ago

242
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:57,264
to start her own rival pudding company,

243
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:59,334
- Heavenly Pudding.
- Fascinating.

244
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:02,576
Yeah, they're shooting their
ad campaign here on Stage 69.

245
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,300
Should be just past the creepy flasher.

246
00:11:05,303 --> 00:11:06,467
That's nice.

247
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,108
Lucifer, I know you're
not listening to me.

248
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,843
Creepy flasher? Stage 69?

249
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:11,912
69? What... where?

250
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:14,143
I reversed the numbers
to get your attention.

251
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:15,949
And what is so important on your phone?

252
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:17,150
I'm trying to reach

253
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:19,186
Charlotte Richards. She
won't answer my calls

254
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:20,420
or respond to my texts.

255
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:22,156
Why are you so obsessed
with your stepmom?

256
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,856
I need to talk to her, get to the bottom

257
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:25,025
of why she's returned.

258
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:26,740
Well, to represent
her client. That's why.

259
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:28,261
No, no.

260
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:29,596
It has to be more than that.

261
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,118
I mean, right when I'm dealing with...

262
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,996
with complications my
Father's thrown my way?

263
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:37,410
No, her return has to be
another one of His grenades.

264
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:38,843
Well, I thought you
were done being affected

265
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,007
by your father's "shenanigans,"

266
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,503
over him "getting in your head."

267
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:43,176
You're right. I did say that, didn't I?

268
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:45,212
- Yes.
- Okay.

269
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:46,380
Okay, fine.

270
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:47,714
I am not thinking about Dad.

271
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:50,017
Not thinking about Charlotte.

272
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:51,785
It's not working. Why is it not working?

273
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,364
Maybe you need a distraction.

274
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:54,566
Something else to focus on.

275
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:56,823
Detective.

276
00:11:56,825 --> 00:12:00,127
You have never been more right.

277
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:02,108
But... No, I meant the ca...

278
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:03,563
To focus on the case.

279
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:13,040
That's it.

280
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,908
What the...?

281
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,045
Not at all accurate, but...

282
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,980
I approve.

283
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:24,518
Unless Dad has something
to do with this as well.

284
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,186
Ugh!

285
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:31,389
So conflicted, but... can't look away.

286
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:11,423
No! No, no, no, no!

287
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,891
More! More!

288
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:13,821
Oh, come on.

289
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:15,460
I need more pudding! More.

290
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,695
I want pudding everywhere.

291
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:18,697
This is a pudding commercial.

292
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,133
I can't sell the pudding
if I can't see the pudding.

293
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,267
And I want more pudding

294
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,136
in... what's her
name... Blondie's mouth.

295
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,672
I don't care if she
can't breathe. Go, now.

296
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:27,973
- Excuse me.
- Geez.

297
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,837
- Grace Foley?
- Wha... why are your clothes still on?

298
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,312
I ask myself that all the time.

299
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:35,881
LAPD. We have some questions for you.

300
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,517
How well did you know Mr. Fisher?

301
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,818
Simon?

302
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,220
I'd been trying to poach that genius

303
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:42,810
ever since I started my own company.

304
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:43,622
Then what?

305
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:45,123
You got tired of him rejecting you,

306
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,025
so you snuck into his lab and...

307
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:51,649
licked the pudding off every
inch of his beautiful...

308
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:52,598
Please.

309
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,915
You... sorry.

310
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,451
You think I killed him?

311
00:13:56,454 --> 00:13:58,669
Vengeance, corporate sabotage,
all in one fell swoop?

312
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,372
- It makes sense.
- Okay.

313
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:03,742
Even if I did kill him, which I did not,

314
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:04,907
you really think

315
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,912
I'm dumb enough to admit it?

316
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:09,305
Especially without my lawyer present?

317
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:12,508
Speaking of, let's get
her down here, shall we?

318
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,339
What?

319
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:16,053
She wants her lawyer here.

320
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,589
- So?
- So,

321
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,992
maybe you should find
out what she desires more?

322
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:21,226
Oh, you want me to...

323
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,494
- Just, yes.
- Okay, then.

324
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:23,795
Why didn't you just ask?

325
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:25,163
Ms. Foley.

326
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,799
Personal space. Ever heard of it?

327
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,935
You don't want to call
your lawyer, do you?

328
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,954
What are you doing?

329
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:33,448
Come on, tell me what you really want.

330
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,274
What's your greatest desire?

331
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:38,157
My greatest desire...

332
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,610
is to...

333
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:43,614
stop shooting this exploitative garbage.

334
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:44,983
Garbage?

335
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,785
What are you talking about?

336
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:48,215
What you're doing is art.

337
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:48,894
Is it, though?

338
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,554
Well, despite the unwelcome reminder

339
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,556
of Dad and my wings,

340
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,265
I've never wanted
pudding more in my life.

341
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,367
Exactly.

342
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,143
Because we're selling sex...

343
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,023
Which has absolutely nothing

344
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,266
to do with pudding...

345
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,035
To distract people from the fact

346
00:15:03,037 --> 00:15:05,378
that my pudding tastes like crap.

347
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,128
Ooh, that's an odd choice of flavors.

348
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:08,340
Well, even more motive for you

349
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,474
to sneak into the lab,

350
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:10,676
steal the secret recipe.

351
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,611
What? Did Simon just get in your way?

352
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:15,914
I didn't need to steal their recipe.

353
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,784
Simon offered to sell
it to me three days ago.

354
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:19,682
What?

355
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,054
But then, before I
could agree to his terms,

356
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:25,221
he was murdered and not by me.

357
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,854
More than anyone, I needed Simon alive.

358
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,869
If Simon was selling the secret recipe,

359
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,238
then this may not be
about corporate sabotage

360
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,708
as much as corporate espionage.

361
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,354
If Adrian found out, he'd
want to stop Simon and...

362
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:48,547
Hello.

363
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,589
- Hi again.
- What's your name?

364
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:52,291
Ugh.

365
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:54,161
- Really?
- Good to see you.

366
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:56,053
It suits you, that name, doesn't it?

367
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:06,565
Really? Can I?

368
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,900
Lucifer.

369
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,236
- Can you come here?
- One moment.

370
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,448
Yes?

371
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:14,672
So, I'm gonna ask Grace a follow-up.

372
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,208
Why don't you

373
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,078
take your new friend and
escort her back to her trailer?

374
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,339
Her trailer? Are you suggesting...?

375
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:25,250
Who are you and what have
you done with the detective?

376
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,252
Put this on her. She looks cold.

377
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,682
Copy that.

378
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:31,089
Darling, would you like to
take five in the trailers?

379
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:35,427
And that's really why I just
need to speak to the woman

380
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,471
whose body once housed my mother's soul.

381
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,264
I don't believe it. He's
doing it again, isn't He?

382
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,866
- Who?
- Dad.

383
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:42,134
He's in my head,

384
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:44,336
ruining this moment that
you and I could be having.

385
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,971
I do apologize.

386
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:49,167
LAPD. Don't move.

387
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,065
Let me guess. You work for Adrian Yates.

388
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:53,145
Think you've got me confused
with somebody else, lady.

389
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:54,596
I don't think I do.

390
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,190
Saw you watching us earlier.

391
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:57,593
Detective, what's happening?

392
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,316
Sometimes big corporations, they have

393
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,821
fixers on their payroll to
prevent corporate espionage.

394
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,089
Or clever detectives

395
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,425
from learning about said espionage.

396
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:08,360
I'm not saying anything
more without my lawyer.

397
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,135
Ah, wonderful.

398
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:11,538
Well, if he works for Yates,

399
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,541
that means his lawyer is
Charlotte Richards, right?

400
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:28,260
You said there was someone to see me.

401
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,716
Oh.

402
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,118
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

403
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,720
Is there something I can help you with?

404
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,356
Yeah.

405
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,891
Answers.

406
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,694
What's with the cold
shoulder, Charlotte?

407
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:45,130
Not just back at the
precinct, but my calls...

408
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,767
You haven't returned any of them.

409
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,468
I'm sorry. I've been incredibly busy.

410
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,603
All that time,

411
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:53,738
what did you think we were?

412
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:56,541
What did you think we were?

413
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,213
I have no freakin' clue.

414
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:02,681
I...

415
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:04,316
You seduce me.

416
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:05,717
You hack into my phone.

417
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,919
You become a suspect in a case.

418
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,522
You tell me I'm
your-your favorite human,

419
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,224
whatever that means.

420
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:13,471
You almost die,

421
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:15,060
and then you ghost me for weeks.

422
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:17,195
Nothing about any of that
makes any sense to me.

423
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,464
I'm sorry, Detective Espinoza.

424
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,534
Dan.

425
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,437
It doesn't make any sense to me either.

426
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,174
Whether you understand it or not,

427
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,943
you don't just pretend
like it... never happened.

428
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:35,780
You know what,

429
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,749
I'm just... I'm gonna let it go.

430
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:39,618
I'm gonna let Lucifer deal with you,

431
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,920
because he's the only
one who ever really...

432
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:44,589
I guess, understood what
you were up to anyways.

433
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,100
So, Lucifer and I were close?

434
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:50,166
Oh, in ways that I'll never understand.

435
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:59,533
Yes, I-I completely
understand, and I will

436
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,372
definitely talk to Trixie.

437
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,008
This won't happen again.

438
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,843
Thanks.

439
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:07,078
That was Trixie's school calling.

440
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,280
Apparently, she's been using

441
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,315
some very creative language today.

442
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,850
Oh. Do tell.

443
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:14,653
Well, she called her math
homework a "cluster duck"

444
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,388
and her teacher a "mother flunker."

445
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,456
Did she not call anyone a "sock sucker"?

446
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,393
What? It's just someone who sucks socks.

447
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:23,214
I can't believe you're
teaching my daughter

448
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:24,729
loophole swear words.

449
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,298
In my defense,

450
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,533
"mother flunker" was entirely
the little deviant's creation.

451
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,268
And very clever of her, I might add.

452
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,336
That's not the point.

453
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,871
I'm trying to teach my child a lesson,

454
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:35,473
and you just made my job
that much more difficult.

455
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,576
You parents, always with your lessons.

456
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,978
Or as I like to call them, mind games.

457
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,882
Well, I'm about to get to the
bottom of my Father's latest.

458
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:46,718
It's Charlotte time!

459
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,986
You're not Charlotte.

460
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:51,656
And yet people get us
confused, like, all the time.

461
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,558
Hi. Larry.

462
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,562
Charlotte is busy at the moment,
so Richards and Wheeler sent me.

463
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,361
Mother flunker.

464
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,674
Where are you going?

465
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:05,503
Well, I only came to see Charlotte.

466
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,372
Besides, having me here
would just make your job

467
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,174
"that much more difficult," wouldn't it?

468
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:25,257
Well, hello.

469
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,494
What...

470
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,330
what are you doing here?

471
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:38,303
I knew it. You are back
for a reason, aren't you?

472
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:40,905
Hmm? Hey?

473
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,407
Come on, tell me. Why are you here?

474
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,697
Mm! Mm!

475
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:02,251
What in Dad's name are you doing?!

476
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:04,751
Don't pretend you didn't like that.

477
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:07,048
- Well, I most certainly did not.
- Lucifer,

478
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:08,673
I know we were close.

479
00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:11,162
- Not that close.
- Oh, no sense in being coy.

480
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:12,957
- We're all alone here.
- Mm!

481
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:18,529
No, no, no, no, no!

482
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:21,665
No!

483
00:21:24,977 --> 00:21:26,703
I...

484
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:28,506
I don't understand.

485
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:31,175
You couldn't keep your
eyes off me at the precinct.

486
00:21:31,177 --> 00:21:35,679
Your desperate messages,
needing to see me.

487
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,317
D-Detective Espinoza...

488
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,687
heartbroken because we were close.

489
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:46,891
For the f... first time

490
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:48,592
since I woke up on
that beach, I thought,

491
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:50,394
"Finally, something that makes sense.

492
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:53,564
Of course I'm sleeping with
Mr. Tall, Dark and Handsome."

493
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:57,097
Uh... uh... But now you're saying

494
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,334
that's not... not even that's the case?

495
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:03,013
Look, I can assure you
that you and I have not

496
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:06,577
or will not ever, ever, ever...

497
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:08,245
sleep together.

498
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:11,427
Well, if not lovers, then
what were we, friends?

499
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,763
More like...

500
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:16,954
family.

501
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:21,525
I can't ta...

502
00:22:21,527 --> 00:22:23,274
can't take this anymore.

503
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:40,210
I'm...

504
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:43,347
I'm missing time.

505
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:44,949
Months...

506
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:47,518
and months of time.

507
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,712
It's like...

508
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:53,382
someone else was living my life.

509
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:55,526
Ruining it.

510
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:57,161
My work...

511
00:22:57,163 --> 00:23:00,164
my relationships, my...

512
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,266
my family.

513
00:23:05,605 --> 00:23:07,884
I have no idea...

514
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,922
why my husband got custody of the kids.

515
00:23:12,712 --> 00:23:15,112
Or why I've been...

516
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:17,414
denied visitation rights.

517
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:25,155
But ever since I woke
up on that beach...

518
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:28,058
I've been pretending...

519
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,593
like I remember it all,

520
00:23:29,595 --> 00:23:32,730
because otherwise everyone
would think that...

521
00:23:32,732 --> 00:23:34,865
that I'm crazy.

522
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:39,485
Maybe I am.

523
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:44,074
You're not crazy.

524
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,881
You're just an innocent, aren't you?

525
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:53,384
Caught up in a game not of your own.

526
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:56,353
Oh, believe me, I'm not innocent.

527
00:23:57,923 --> 00:24:00,891
But I don't think I deserve...

528
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:02,407
What?

529
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,664
In my m...

530
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:10,267
my missing time...

531
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:12,469
it feels like I was...

532
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:13,871
trapped...

533
00:24:13,873 --> 00:24:16,235
in some...

534
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:18,709
horrible nightmare,

535
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:21,111
reliving it over and over and...

536
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:23,673
over again.

537
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:26,417
It feels almost like I was in...

538
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:27,951
Hell?

539
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:33,090
Now you probably think I'm crazy, too.

540
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:36,149
Do you realize who you're talking to?

541
00:24:36,152 --> 00:24:38,594
Right. Lucifer.

542
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,732
The Devil.

543
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:43,667
Yeah, well, if you believe me,

544
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:45,430
then you're just as crazy as I am.

545
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:48,672
Or perhaps you knew
exactly where you were.

546
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:50,808
Why would I go to Hell?

547
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,210
It's not like I'm a bad person.

548
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:54,678
I work hard.

549
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,149
Pay my taxes. Don't hurt anyone.

550
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,016
Well, perhaps you feel
more guilt than you realize.

551
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:09,993
Well, on the ridiculous...

552
00:25:09,995 --> 00:25:13,664
off chance that Hell
actually is possible...

553
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:17,067
how do I make sure I never go back?

554
00:25:19,438 --> 00:25:23,107
Well, uh, this is your
second chance, correct?

555
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:25,576
So perhaps avoid doing

556
00:25:25,578 --> 00:25:28,045
devious and dastardly
things from now on.

557
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:29,962
I mean, it's boring, I know.

558
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:33,817
Does...

559
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:37,588
knowingly impeding a
homicide investigation count?

560
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:40,591
Uh...

561
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:46,839
Why does stuff like
this always happen to me?

562
00:25:46,842 --> 00:25:47,631
Because you are

563
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:51,008
a softy, Dan... it's one of the
many things I love about you.

564
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:52,669
No, what I am is a dummy.

565
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:55,219
She acts like I barely
exist, so what do I do?

566
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,438
I go to her office

567
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:58,489
to get rejected again.

568
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:00,344
You're being too hard on yourself.

569
00:26:01,514 --> 00:26:03,820
And eating your emotions?
I thought you were

570
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:05,281
giving that stuff up.

571
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:08,485
I can't just quit cold turkey, Ella.

572
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:10,120
Not at a time like this.

573
00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:12,341
Hey, it could always be worse.

574
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:14,091
You could end up like our vic here.

575
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:15,552
Guess what his autopsy found.

576
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:17,989
Couple of kidney stones
the size of golf balls.

577
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:20,042
Ouch.

578
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,499
Dude was suffering from
intense renal failure.

579
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:24,768
I mean, even he hadn't
been pudding'd alive,

580
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,205
he would have died within
days from urinary sepsis.

581
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,973
What are the odds,

582
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:32,509
two horrible ways of dying
hitting the same person

583
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:34,444
around the same time?

584
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:37,003
That's a good point.

585
00:26:37,006 --> 00:26:39,206
What are the odds?

586
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:41,919
It says here that Pudding
Plus employs you to handle

587
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:43,253
their corporate security.

588
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:45,522
And I know that Simon Fisher

589
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:47,424
compromised that
security by trying to sell

590
00:26:47,426 --> 00:26:49,281
your company's most valuable secret

591
00:26:49,284 --> 00:26:50,661
to the other side.

592
00:26:50,663 --> 00:26:52,196
- So?
- So...

593
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:54,628
would you consider Mr. Fisher "handled"?

594
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:57,434
My client doesn't need
to respond to that.

595
00:26:57,436 --> 00:26:59,305
You're right.

596
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:01,572
I guess we'll just leave it to a jury.

597
00:27:01,574 --> 00:27:03,589
There is no "other side."

598
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:06,877
Excuse me?

599
00:27:08,013 --> 00:27:09,847
I guess Grace forgot to mention,

600
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,636
as of a month ago, Pudding Plus

601
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:14,384
and Heavenly Pudding decided to merge.

602
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:16,636
Tell her.

603
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:18,888
It's true. And also

604
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:21,425
not illegal... Last time I checked.

605
00:27:21,427 --> 00:27:23,627
Richards and Wheeler are representing

606
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:25,112
the merged company.

607
00:27:25,115 --> 00:27:26,956
So whatever threat
Fisher posed by selling

608
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,867
his recipe to the "other side," gone.

609
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,768
No motive for murder.

610
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,303
Then why were you following me?

611
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:35,973
I didn't know where your
investigation was going.

612
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:38,508
Couldn't let Fisher's
death threaten the merger.

613
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:42,246
Do you know how much
money is in pudding?

614
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:43,780
Detective.

615
00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:46,283
You're needed in the conference room.

616
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:47,751
Ah.

617
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,653
Detective, look who I found.

618
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:51,237
And she comes bearing gifts.

619
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,506
The security footage

620
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,124
you requested.

621
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:55,558
Why are you handing this over now?

622
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:58,227
- You seemed so opposed to it earlier.
- Well, it's recently come

623
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,530
to my attention that I
need to make a change.

624
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:02,617
So I'm trying to do what's right.

625
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,735
If I can prove my client is innocent

626
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:06,803
and help you find your killer...

627
00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:08,589
clean conscience, here I come.

628
00:28:08,592 --> 00:28:10,292
Huh.

629
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:29,644
You can't see the killer here.

630
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:31,314
Just as my client said.

631
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:33,578
All this video shows is
what we already know...

632
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:36,609
That someone familiar with
the cameras went into this room

633
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:38,268
and pushed Simon into the vat.

634
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,175
Yeah, but everyone
with access had alibis.

635
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:41,907
Oh, you're not suggesting a murderer

636
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:43,507
actually lied about where they were?

637
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,507
Daniel.

638
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,910
We double-checked them, okay?

639
00:28:46,912 --> 00:28:48,946
They're all pretty ironclad.

640
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:52,115
Hmm.

641
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:54,952
Oh, my gosh.

642
00:28:56,155 --> 00:28:57,921
Of course.

643
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:00,133
What?

644
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:01,436
What the hell, Ella?

645
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,565
You're welcome.

646
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:03,926
I just saved your life.

647
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:04,895
Check it out.

648
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:06,797
Two other secret ingredients, right?

649
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,832
Melamine and cyanuric acid.

650
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,323
Separate, both are harmless.

651
00:29:10,326 --> 00:29:13,169
But when combined, they
create a hard-to-detect toxin

652
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:15,680
that, over time, can
cause... Drumroll, please...

653
00:29:15,683 --> 00:29:16,974
Renal failure.

654
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:18,448
The kidney stones you found.

655
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:22,206
Yeah. Looks like the
"plus" in Pudding Plus...

656
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:23,509
is poison.

657
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:39,426
Poisonous pudding? Are you kidding me?

658
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:40,891
So, Simon must have gotten sick

659
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:42,403
from his constant exposure to it?

660
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,983
Well, what kind of idiot
would intentionally put poison

661
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:47,441
- in their own product?
- These two chemicals have been known

662
00:29:47,444 --> 00:29:49,716
to fake the appearance of
a higher protein content.

663
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,590
Which is Pudding Plus'
biggest selling point.

664
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:54,156
But wouldn't people eventually
realize that it's poisonous?

665
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,700
- I mean, the company would lose everything.
- Not necessarily.

666
00:29:56,703 --> 00:29:58,426
If you have hundreds
of millions of dollars,

667
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,121
and you get sued for
a couple of million,

668
00:30:00,123 --> 00:30:02,121
you still have hundreds
of millions of dollars.

669
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:04,281
- But people die.
- Yeah, well,

670
00:30:04,284 --> 00:30:07,010
it's the same calculation
the car manufacturers make

671
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,180
when they find out they
have faulty airbags.

672
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:11,950
Which costs them less, recalling the car

673
00:30:11,953 --> 00:30:13,568
or enduring the lawsuits?

674
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,169
Yeah, but why would Simon

675
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:17,398
try to sell the formula to
Grace if it was killing him?

676
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:18,656
Unless he didn't.

677
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,341
Maybe when he found out what he created,

678
00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:21,609
he was just trying to stop it.

679
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,294
And who better to expose

680
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:24,426
Pudding Plus' dirty secret

681
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:25,928
than their biggest competitor?

682
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,106
But Simon didn't know.

683
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:28,116
The two companies were merging.

684
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,917
Soon they won't be in competition.

685
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,266
Suddenly, everyone has motive

686
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:32,434
to keep Simon quiet.

687
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:34,221
Adrian, Grace and the fixer.

688
00:30:34,224 --> 00:30:35,679
Three potential killers.

689
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:38,258
And as the merged company's counsel...

690
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,984
you represent all of them.

691
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:46,135
Charlotte, where are you going?

692
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:48,372
To join the Peace Corps
or donate my entire savings

693
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:51,572
to an orphanage or build a shelter
for blind, one-legged puppies.

694
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:53,508
Well, as long as you're
not being overdramatic.

695
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,010
I thought delivering those
tapes would help clear my ledger.

696
00:30:56,012 --> 00:30:58,545
But instead, it just revealed
that I've been defending

697
00:30:58,548 --> 00:31:00,048
three guilty people?

698
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,700
- Uh...
- If that's true,

699
00:31:01,703 --> 00:31:03,117
how guilty does that make me?

700
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:13,184
This isn't a good time.

701
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:14,919
I know how you've been treating Dan.

702
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:16,964
Okay? And I want you to
know that I got his back.

703
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:19,380
- What's that mean?
- I used to see

704
00:31:19,383 --> 00:31:21,536
a light in you.

705
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:24,205
But now, I don't know,
something's different.

706
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:26,741
All I see now...

707
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:28,390
is darkness.

708
00:31:35,578 --> 00:31:38,059
Oh, there you are.
Where'd you run off to?

709
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,054
Just needed to clear my head.

710
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:42,824
- Do you think Charlotte will be all right?
- Yeah.

711
00:31:42,826 --> 00:31:45,093
Why wouldn't she be?
That woman's like a rock.

712
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:48,114
Like a very mean, scary, hot,

713
00:31:48,117 --> 00:31:49,731
well-dressed rock.

714
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:53,201
Yes, well... you'd be
surprised, Detective.

715
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,535
Okay.

716
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,871
Well, now that we
know all three suspects

717
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,740
have the same motive... money...

718
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:01,042
I looked into the company's financials

719
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,122
to see who had the most to
lose if the merger failed.

720
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,881
And get this... It's none of our three.

721
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,716
You really think I killed Simon?

722
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,852
Lalo, we know you stood to gain hundreds

723
00:32:10,854 --> 00:32:12,844
of thousands of dollars
in vested stock options

724
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,581
once those two pudding companies merged.

725
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,424
That's a lot of money.

726
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:17,859
For you. Obviously.

727
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:19,994
But, uh, it all would have disappeared

728
00:32:19,996 --> 00:32:22,697
had Simon revealed the
truth behind his illness.

729
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:24,632
You... you mean Simon really was sick?

730
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:25,900
You knew about that?

731
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,236
Sure. He said he was gonna die.

732
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,204
But I didn't take it seriously.

733
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:32,807
- He said a lot of things that night.
- What night?

734
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:34,809
About a month ago, we went out drinking.

735
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:36,411
Simon got wasted.

736
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,846
He started going off about how Mr. Yates

737
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:40,214
wasn't listening to him,

738
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:42,417
and that people were
gonna suffer for it.

739
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,987
He said something about
how it was his own fault.

740
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:47,588
Simon said that...

741
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,324
maybe he should just end it.

742
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:51,793
End what?

743
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:52,994
His life.

744
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:54,762
Huh.

745
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,800
I had no idea what he was talking about.

746
00:32:56,803 --> 00:32:59,112
And you didn't think
to tell us this sooner?

747
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:01,334
Like when he showed up dead?

748
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:04,672
A bunch of drunken nonsense?

749
00:33:04,674 --> 00:33:06,841
It's not like he jumped

750
00:33:06,843 --> 00:33:08,276
into that vat.

751
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,311
I mean...

752
00:33:10,313 --> 00:33:12,980
boiling pudding?

753
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:15,616
There's easier ways to go.

754
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,618
But none so revealing.

755
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,886
What?

756
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:20,855
What if this was Simon's Hail Mary?

757
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:23,761
A way to expose the truth
that he felt so guilty about.

758
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:25,760
Oh, so you think the man
actually killed himself

759
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:27,428
to lead us to the toxin?

760
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,130
Well, if he did, it worked.

761
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:33,266
The suicide version's
looking more and more likely.

762
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:35,770
Day before his death,
Simon changed his will.

763
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:36,909
He donated

764
00:33:36,912 --> 00:33:39,173
all his possessions to charity.

765
00:33:39,175 --> 00:33:41,542
He even gave away his pet turtle.

766
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:43,244
Huh.

767
00:33:43,246 --> 00:33:45,580
And the scuff marks on the platform...

768
00:33:45,582 --> 00:33:48,839
He must have faked a struggle
to make it look like a homicide.

769
00:33:48,842 --> 00:33:51,777
To keep us investigating the companies.

770
00:33:52,753 --> 00:33:54,522
Hello, Charlotte Richards' office.

771
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:56,123
Charlotte, good news.

772
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,458
It was a suicide.

773
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,360
So no need to worry.

774
00:33:59,362 --> 00:34:01,164
You won't be representing any murderers.

775
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,897
Charlotte just left.

776
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:06,200
She went to meet some clients.

777
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:07,468
Why do I get the feeling

778
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,932
Charlotte's about to do
something very stupid?

779
00:34:16,331 --> 00:34:18,613
So, what's this about? Why
the last-minute meeting?

780
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:19,747
Yeah, and why here?

781
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:21,582
Didn't we agree to delay merger talk

782
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:24,852
until after the LAPD
ends their investigation?

783
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,889
We did. This meeting
is about other business.

784
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:29,924
Personal business.

785
00:34:29,926 --> 00:34:31,425
What the hell does that mean?

786
00:34:31,427 --> 00:34:33,227
No one's leaving here until I figure out

787
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:36,163
which one of you murdered Simon Fisher.

788
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,266
Um...

789
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,807
So, a funny thing happened

790
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:55,576
a couple of months ago.

791
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:58,445
I sort of died.

792
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:02,215
And apparently there's
a chance I went to Hell.

793
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:03,483
Oh, I know. I was...

794
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,519
I was as shocked as you are.

795
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:09,156
I'm feeling much better now.

796
00:35:09,158 --> 00:35:12,492
Thanks for asking.

797
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:15,546
Though there might be

798
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:18,965
a slight chance

799
00:35:18,968 --> 00:35:21,234
that I'm having a nervous breakdown

800
00:35:21,236 --> 00:35:22,913
as we speak.

801
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,149
Anyhow...

802
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:26,205
I've had some time to think,

803
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:30,010
and I'm pretty sure that my sin

804
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:31,778
was a lifetime of defending

805
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,913
known criminals and murderers.

806
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:35,881
Apparently nobody bothered to tell me

807
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,618
that all the blood that they shed

808
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,366
is on my hands, too.

809
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:44,057
Now, here I am

810
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,026
with a second chance,

811
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:47,796
and one of you...

812
00:35:47,815 --> 00:35:52,249
is screwing it up.

813
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:54,444
So, speak.

814
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:58,601
Which one of you killed Simon?

815
00:35:58,604 --> 00:36:01,072
- Charlotte, none of us did it.
- He's right.

816
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,343
No, I know that Simon was
about to blow the whistle

817
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:05,846
on your little secret.

818
00:36:05,848 --> 00:36:07,314
So one of you

819
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:08,843
must have done it.

820
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,320
Why are we still sitting here?

821
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,726
I'm done listening to this crazy bitch.

822
00:36:15,729 --> 00:36:17,396
Sit down!

823
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,731
Why don't you make me?

824
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,429
That can't be good.

825
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,466
What the hell? You could have shot me.

826
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:28,268
Very easily.

827
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,577
Now sit.

828
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:32,265
Look, lady, all I did
was intimidate Simon.

829
00:36:32,268 --> 00:36:33,607
And I stopped as soon as Adrian

830
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:36,376
called me off. I was just
doing what he paid me to do.

831
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:38,078
W-We didn't need to kill Simon.

832
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,710
- We kept him quiet.
- A-And just sped up the merger.

833
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:43,082
We were all set to make record profits

834
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:45,460
despite Simon's
nitpicky safety concerns.

835
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:48,234
Yeah. Why would we go
kill him after all of that?

836
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:49,679
Well, I don't know.

837
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:51,158
Loose ends, maybe?

838
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,927
I'm gonna make this right one way

839
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:56,196
- or another.
- Charlotte.

840
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,398
Wait.

841
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,834
- Lucifer?
- They're telling the truth.

842
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:03,704
None of these scoundrels killed Simon.

843
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:05,205
He killed himself.

844
00:37:05,207 --> 00:37:07,174
A dying man's plan to expose the company

845
00:37:07,176 --> 00:37:08,742
and its crimes.

846
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:11,645
That doesn't make any sense.

847
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,513
Charlotte...

848
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:15,273
they're innocent.

849
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,007
No.

850
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,458
No, they're not.

851
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,195
Did you not hear what I just said?

852
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:29,765
Oh, I heard. So they didn't kill Simon.

853
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:32,499
What about everybody who
eats their stupid pudding?

854
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,535
They all knew their
product was poisonous.

855
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:39,439
Innocent people are
gonna die because of them.

856
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:40,866
I've lived my life

857
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:42,296
finding loopholes,

858
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:45,257
ways of evading
responsibility for my clients.

859
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:49,149
Myself.

860
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:51,685
Turns out...

861
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:55,188
there are no loopholes.

862
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,357
If you're guilty,

863
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,273
you're guilty.

864
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,393
I understand that you want

865
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:02,829
to clear the red from your ledger.

866
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:06,398
But believe me, Charlotte,
this is not the way to do it.

867
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:08,785
Then what am I supposed to do?

868
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:10,762
I can't go...

869
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:13,632
I can't go back there.

870
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,350
Can't.

871
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:19,429
Then here's what you
need to do, Charlotte.

872
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:21,226
Trust me.

873
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,393
Thank you.

874
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,063
What about them?

875
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,565
Well...

876
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,400
whilst I was lurking in the shadows,

877
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,515
they said quite a few
incriminating things.

878
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:46,186
Detective, was that enough for
a proper perp walk of shame?

879
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:47,788
Yep, plenty.

880
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:54,890
FBI's gonna have a field day
with these recorded confessions.

881
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:56,859
You may not have pushed
Simon to his death,

882
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:58,896
but you'll pay for your
role in poisoning him.

883
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:05,007
- Nice win, partner.
- Thank you very much.

884
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:07,179
I'm just surprised you let
me enter the factory first.

885
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:09,328
Oh, I figured it was
your turn to get shot at.

886
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:12,165
- Oh.
- You know, you were right about Charlotte.

887
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:14,100
There's more to her than I thought.

888
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,870
- The things she said...
- Sounded loony?

889
00:39:16,872 --> 00:39:19,906
No. Sounded like somebody wrestling

890
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,241
with their demons.

891
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:29,416
I couldn't help but overhear
what you said back there.

892
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:31,585
Sounds like you're...

893
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:34,020
going through a lot.

894
00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:35,689
I'm sorry you're struggling.

895
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,023
You're right.

896
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:39,693
I am going through a lot.

897
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:43,543
But that's no excuse
for how I've treated you.

898
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:46,298
Well, I appreciate that.

899
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,546
Maybe we could meet for coffee sometime.

900
00:39:51,406 --> 00:39:53,473
Maybe.

901
00:39:55,377 --> 00:39:57,110
Hope I'm not interrupting
anything, Daniel.

902
00:39:57,112 --> 00:39:59,479
Charlotte, ready for that ride home?

903
00:40:07,843 --> 00:40:10,320
Trixie, can you come out here?

904
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:11,921
Hi, Mommy.

905
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,241
Monkey, I want to talk to you

906
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:18,064
about what happened today at school.

907
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:20,801
Did you tell Miss Morgan

908
00:40:20,804 --> 00:40:22,469
to "go to shell"?

909
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:25,405
I didn't technically break any rules.

910
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,978
You know what?

911
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:34,514
Lucifer was right.

912
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:37,245
The swear jar, it's... it's a dumb idea.

913
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:39,715
Mommy gave you a bunch of rules

914
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:41,788
without explaining things.

915
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,101
The real reason

916
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:45,337
that we shouldn't swear

917
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,574
is that bad words make people feel bad.

918
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:51,512
And I know you don't want to
make people feel bad, right?

919
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:54,919
'Cause the truth is if you
go looking for loopholes,

920
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:56,822
you'll always find them.

921
00:40:56,825 --> 00:41:00,407
And I can't force you
to do the right thing.

922
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:02,460
You'll just have to
learn that on your own.

923
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:05,195
So no more swear jar. Okay?

924
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:10,449
So does that mean I get my money back?

925
00:41:10,452 --> 00:41:11,952
Nice try.

926
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:19,249
Would you like to come in?

927
00:41:19,252 --> 00:41:21,234
You're not gonna pounce
on me again, are you?

928
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:23,638
Because that was a
smashing success last time.

929
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:25,507
Come in, scaredy-cat.

930
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:29,112
After today, I need wine stat.

931
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,837
This whole "being good" thing?

932
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,710
Tougher than I thought.

933
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:34,541
It's a nice place you've got.

934
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:38,078
Though, uh, could stand
to nest a bit more.

935
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,915
I don't even remember
getting this place.

936
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:44,343
I hope you like red.

937
00:41:44,346 --> 00:41:46,515
I'm a ros girl, myself.

938
00:41:46,518 --> 00:41:49,455
Apparently while I was away,

939
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,499
I bought 30 cases of Merlot.

940
00:41:51,502 --> 00:41:53,793
Yes. Sorry about that.

941
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:54,928
Why would you be sorry?

942
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,830
You're not responsible for my lost time.

943
00:41:56,832 --> 00:41:58,531
No.

944
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:00,567
Yet I can't help but feel...

945
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:05,605
somewhat accountable.

946
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,279
Is that why you're here?

947
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:10,377
Well, this strange,
inexplicable compulsion

948
00:42:10,379 --> 00:42:11,978
to make sure you're okay?

949
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,901
Very possibly.

950
00:42:13,904 --> 00:42:16,249
Dad be damned.

951
00:42:19,023 --> 00:42:21,123
You spent time with me when I...

952
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:24,027
wasn't me.

953
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:28,294
What was I like?

954
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:32,521
Well, you were...

955
00:42:32,524 --> 00:42:35,325
quite the handful, actually.

956
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:37,161
Intense.

957
00:42:37,164 --> 00:42:38,764
Jealous.

958
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,773
Hair-trigger emotions.

959
00:42:40,776 --> 00:42:44,177
Prone to making
cosmically epic mistakes.

960
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:49,068
But everything that you did...

961
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:52,539
The other you did, I...

962
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:55,777
I know that it came from a place...

963
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,160
of love.

964
00:43:02,697 --> 00:43:06,332
I will miss her.

965
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,802
More than she'll ever know.

966
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:13,940
But that isn't you, is it?

967
00:43:13,942 --> 00:43:15,842
- No. No, it's not.
- No.

968
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:17,710
Right. Well, then...

969
00:43:17,712 --> 00:43:20,099
I look forward

970
00:43:20,102 --> 00:43:21,836
to getting to know the real you.

971
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:26,081
And I you.

972
00:43:26,084 --> 00:43:28,244
Welcome back, Charlotte Richards.

973
00:43:38,295 --> 00:43:44,580
