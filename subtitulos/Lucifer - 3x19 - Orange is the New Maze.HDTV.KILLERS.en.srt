1
00:00:00,571 --> 00:00:03,101
- Previously on Lucifer...
- There's only room for one

2
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:04,813
immortal in the detective's
life, and that position's

3
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:06,132
- already been filled.
- By you?

4
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:09,153
The detective and I are a team.
There's just no room for a third.

5
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:10,630
- You're a good man.
- You deserve someone

6
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:11,595
who's gonna let you in,

7
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:13,294
and I want to do that if
you'll give me the chance.

8
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,536
Mom! Lucifer said that you were gone.

9
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,365
Do I know you? You know Lucifer.

10
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:18,699
You do know me.

11
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:19,800
And I am sick

12
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:21,786
of your Goody Two-shoes ex-wife

13
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,837
and that stupid little brat of yours.

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,515
Charlotte Richards is back.

15
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,007
I think that maybe she
deserves to know the truth.

16
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,481
She's not so easily won over.

17
00:00:29,484 --> 00:00:31,676
You are totally freaking out right now.

18
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,514
- What?
- About this coming between you and Chloe.

19
00:00:34,516 --> 00:00:36,115
Don't be preposterous.

20
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:45,357
Bloody hell!

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,493
Easy, Maze! Gah.

22
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,707
Could have taken my eye
out with that spatula.

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,598
What on earth are you looking for?

24
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,465
And... why are we meeting here, anyway?

25
00:00:53,468 --> 00:00:55,467
- I heard you moved out.
- I did.

26
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,935
I forgot my knife.

27
00:00:56,937 --> 00:00:59,543
Must have... left it here somewhere.

28
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:00,572
Oh, no,

29
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:02,975
not one of your hell-forged
blades... that is a loss.

30
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:05,036
Not a blade. A knife.

31
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:07,801
Forged in... I don't know, China.

32
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:09,547
Ah. Right, priceless.

33
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,304
I can't find it anywhere.

34
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:17,053
Green tea coconut water.

35
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,926
Worth the trip, at least.

36
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,758
You can't find this stuff in Hell.

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,826
What do you mean, Hell?

38
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:24,418
I am so done, Lucifer.

39
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:26,663
I am done with this apartment,

40
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:27,998
all humans...

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,532
Earth, in general.

42
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:34,335
I want out. Now.

43
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:35,637
I want to go home.

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,497
You...

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,943
you want me to fly you down to Hell?

46
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:42,481
For good? That's a bit rash, isn't it?

47
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:44,913
No, it's not. And I've
made up my mind, so...

48
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:46,115
get your wings out.

49
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:47,468
- No biggie.
- Wrong.

50
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:49,731
Big biggie. Huge biggie.

51
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,854
I don't know if you
remember, Maze, but last time

52
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:53,722
I took someone on a celestial Uber ride,

53
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:55,293
the detective almost died.

54
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:57,159
Seriously?

55
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:00,809
You're... saying no because
you're afraid of your daddy?

56
00:02:00,812 --> 00:02:03,981
No, I just don't want
anyone to get hurt.

57
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:07,067
Look, you-you clearly need to
blow off some steam, don't you?

58
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,569
Take your mind off Ameninda?

59
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:11,739
No. Lindadiel?

60
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:13,351
Whatever. That whole fiasco.

61
00:02:13,354 --> 00:02:16,723
How about a nice weekend in Catalina?

62
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:18,555
You went to Hell for Pierce,

63
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:20,125
a guy you don't even like,

64
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:21,928
and you won't do the same for me?

65
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,122
No.

66
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,719
I swear to you, Lucifer,

67
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:27,954
you are gonna regret this.

68
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:30,531
Are you threatening me, Mazikeen?

69
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,671
Oh, hey. Hey, guys.

70
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:36,527
What happened?

71
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,897
Don't worry, Detective.

72
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:40,632
Maze was just leaving. Weren't you?

73
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:42,034
Oh.

74
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:46,105
Wait, wait, hold on. Maze, Maze, um...

75
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:48,293
you know, I've been
trying to explain to Trixie

76
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:52,286
that there must be some reason
why you hurt her feelings.

77
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,946
You know, some misunderstanding.

78
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:56,247
Or at least, I hope.

79
00:02:56,249 --> 00:02:57,481
No.

80
00:02:57,483 --> 00:03:01,152
I just forgot some of
my stuff. That's it.

81
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:03,054
Maze.

82
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:05,889
Look, I never asked you to move out.

83
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:09,092
Can't you see that you're
doing this to yourself?

84
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:10,734
So now this is my fault?

85
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:14,598
Maze, come on.

86
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,868
Demons. Am I right?

87
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,122
Lucifer, name-calling isn't gonna help.

88
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,848
Um, maybe you should go talk to her.

89
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:24,942
You know? Like now.

90
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,308
Well, I'd rather not, Detective.

91
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,523
It seems like she needs
space. Miles of it.

92
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:30,872
Well, now's not the best time...

93
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,181
for you to...

94
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:33,182
Hey.

95
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:34,617
Lucifer.

96
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:36,018
Hello, Lieutenant.

97
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,593
What, uh... what are you doing here?

98
00:03:38,596 --> 00:03:39,895
Uh...

99
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:42,601
I mean, I suppose I knew you
two were becoming friendly...

100
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:44,731
I just didn't expect to see you here.

101
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:46,324
On a weekend.

102
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:49,395
Wearing open-toe,
non-work-related Birkis.

103
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:50,766
We were at the beach.

104
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:51,867
Yeah.

105
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:54,398
To a beach... murder.

106
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,778
There was a murder... at the beach.

107
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:58,953
New case. I-I was gonna tell you.

108
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:01,325
But I didn't because
I know how much you...

109
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,443
hate...

110
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:04,645
sand.

111
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:06,647
Right.

112
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:09,254
Body's in the ice chest, is
it? I'm sure Ms. Lopez will have

113
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:10,856
something to say about that.

114
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:12,286
Hmm.

115
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:13,767
Well, then, um...

116
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,670
best of luck with your beach murder.

117
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,958
Do you want to stay, or...?

118
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,003
Beach murder?

119
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:25,230
I'm sorry. I-I-I panicked.

120
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:28,672
'Cause he's a coworker, and,
you know, you're a coworker.

121
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:30,542
Maybe we should talk about some work...

122
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:32,355
life boundaries...
Besides, I didn't know

123
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:34,589
if you wanted everybody to
know that we were dating.

124
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:36,275
I don't care who knows.

125
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,761
You don't?

126
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:40,386
No. If you want to take
it slow, that's okay,

127
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,287
but from where I stand, I'm all in.

128
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,822
So, I was getting coffee,
minding my own business,

129
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:55,391
and a guy grabs my arm.

130
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:58,694
Really? What... kind of guy?

131
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:00,519
A tall, serious black man.

132
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:01,597
Bald.

133
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:04,900
Bald, like, in a... in a very sexy way?

134
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:06,996
Yes. You know him?

135
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,198
Uh, no. No.

136
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,159
Just, um, painting a picture.

137
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:13,172
I can... I can see it all now.

138
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:15,074
Well, he called me Mom.

139
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:17,277
Said some really strange things.

140
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,402
Sounds like a real nut bar.

141
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:21,447
It's a good thing you're
not gonna see him again.

142
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:22,715
That's the thing.

143
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:23,949
He came back.

144
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:25,885
- He did?
- Then he claimed

145
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:29,490
that he could fill in what
happened in my memory gap.

146
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:34,493
What he said then was truly bizarre.

147
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:37,329
Yeah, well, he should have
left well enough alone.

148
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:39,298
Whoever he is.

149
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,700
Maybe you should just forget about it,

150
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:45,135
keep moving forward,
like you've been doing.

151
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,970
You have to hear how crazy it was.

152
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,301
He said Lucifer was his brother.

153
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:52,506
Which I guess is possible
if one of them were adopted.

154
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:54,675
And raised with a different accent.

155
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:56,347
- Yeah, it's...
- Then he said

156
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:59,058
I was his stepmom. But he's a grown man.

157
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:01,084
I mean, his father
would have to be ancient.

158
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:02,686
Oh, right. I...

159
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:05,917
I mean, as if I would go
running around marrying old men

160
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,724
and then forgetting all about it.

161
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:09,526
Would I?

162
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:12,128
Charlotte, I don't think this man,

163
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,664
whoever he is...

164
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,366
has your best interests at heart.

165
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:19,301
That's the thing.

166
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:22,037
He seemed to really care about me.

167
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,542
At least... who I was then.

168
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:27,175
This man wasn't lying.

169
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:29,911
At least he believed...

170
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:31,680
he was telling the truth.

171
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,883
Which means...

172
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:39,954
I should dig a little
deeper into his story. Right?

173
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:41,222
Right.

174
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,977
She's being really self-destructive.

175
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,779
I mean, she's losing all of her friends.

176
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:53,615
Maze is definitely
spiraling out of control...

177
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:54,784
I'm worried about her.

178
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:56,441
She gets like this sometimes.

179
00:06:56,444 --> 00:06:58,534
Maze just needs to blow
off some steam, that's all.

180
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:01,905
I told her so myself, and I'm
quite sure she'll see sense.

181
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:02,872
Thanks.

182
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:05,341
Hey, Ella. What do we have?

183
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:08,711
Mid-30s, male, multiple stab wounds.

184
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:11,761
No ID, so... I'm gonna run
his prints through IBIS.

185
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,281
Right. Detective, do you think

186
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:15,751
- this might be related to your beach murder?
- Ugh.

187
00:07:15,753 --> 00:07:17,419
I hate beach murders.

188
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:20,178
So mean. It's, like,
just let people swim.

189
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:21,194
Mm.

190
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:23,325
Um, there was no beach murder.

191
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:27,194
Ah. So what was Pierce
doing at your house, then?

192
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,396
We had a date.

193
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:31,302
Right.

194
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:33,271
Right. I thought as much.

195
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:35,503
Bully for you, Detective.

196
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:38,405
Uh, did I mention the
Vic was male? And, uh,

197
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:39,707
would you look at those earlobes?

198
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,308
So big. Huge. Huge earlobes.

199
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,777
Which tells me absolutely
nothing. But I can keep going.

200
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,546
And the gunsho... Ooh,
look! Oh, wait, looky there.

201
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:49,650
Oh. Security camera. Okay.

202
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:52,052
I'll see if there's,
uh, footage of the crime.

203
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:57,323
Oh, let it out, buddy. Even
though Pierce and Decker

204
00:07:57,325 --> 00:07:59,725
are totally hot together,
I know change is rough.

205
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:01,593
Ms. Lopez, please. Enough.

206
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:03,262
- Thank you.
- Lucifer...

207
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:04,787
okay, you and Chloe

208
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,231
have this undefined
something or other, okay,

209
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:08,780
that I never really understood.

210
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:11,369
It's-it's on a... a whole other plane.

211
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:13,438
Even though Pierce and Decker, I mean,

212
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,508
whoo-ee, what gorgeous babies those
two would have, or die trying...

213
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,378
But I'm sorry this is rough for you.

214
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,846
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

215
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,381
I'm more than fine, actually.

216
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:25,016
I mean, those two dating

217
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:26,959
was practically my idea, so...

218
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:28,128
Can we...?

219
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,330
Uh, yeah, so...

220
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,733
Guys.

221
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:31,868
We got something.

222
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:34,623
Yeah.

223
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:44,501
Oh, no.

224
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:46,937
That isn't...

225
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:58,647
You told her to blow off some steam?

226
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:01,717
Well, I was really hoping
she'd choose Catalina.

227
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:08,923

228
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,351
There's no sign of Maze
at any of the usual spots.

229
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:20,886
And she's not answering my calls.

230
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:22,788
Most definitely the actions
of an innocent woman.

231
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,356
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

232
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:25,962
It's not like the video shows her

233
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,431
actually stabbing our Vic.

234
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,735
No. Merely plucking

235
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,629
her knife out of his chest.

236
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:32,392
Do you really think she did this?

237
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:34,532
I mean, yes, Maze is rash...

238
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:35,712
Or nuclear, more like.

239
00:09:35,715 --> 00:09:37,314
There's got to be another explanation.

240
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:38,937
There is. It's about me.

241
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:41,605
Maze asked me to take
her home, and I said no,

242
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:43,041
at which point she flew into a rage

243
00:09:43,044 --> 00:09:44,542
and threatened to make me sorry.

244
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,944
So she's clearly acting out.

245
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:47,878
But if she thinks she can manipulate me

246
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,047
into changing my mind,
then she's sorely mistaken.

247
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,082
So you didn't give her
a ride home one night.

248
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:54,338
I mean, call me crazy, but
that doesn't make someone kill.

249
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:56,453
Hey.

250
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:58,255
Hey there, Lieutenant.

251
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:00,662
Um... any updates?

252
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:02,792
Mm-hmm. Our Vic is an ex-con

253
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:03,994
named Mike Biltz.

254
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:06,028
Hmm. An active bounty of Mazikeen Smith.

255
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,196
- Hmm.
- Well, Maze bounties

256
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:08,397
a lot of people, you know.

257
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,908
She's a overachiever, that Maze.

258
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:11,244
She's had a prior run-in with him.

259
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:13,001
It says she brought him in once before.

260
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:14,978
So she knows him... It
doesn't mean anything.

261
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,372
Or one very obvious thing... Guilty.

262
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,508
Chloe, is this case
too personal for you?

263
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,674
Maybe your roommate isn't
who you think she is.

264
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:23,810
- Ex-roommate. I'm just saying.
- All right,

265
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,284
well, I'll need you to stay impartial.

266
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:27,486
Copy that. I'll keep it
completely professional.

267
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:28,922
Where as I, on the other hand,

268
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:30,625
will keep things entirely personal.

269
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:33,487
I will not rest until we track
down that manipulative demon.

270
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,890
In fact, I'm gonna go and
look for Maze again now.

271
00:10:35,892 --> 00:10:37,658
All right. Great. I'm
gonna check out a lead

272
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,806
on our Vic's last place of
employment... some winery

273
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,109
called Monte De Oro. I'll go with you.

274
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:43,144
Okay.

275
00:10:43,147 --> 00:10:45,230
Uh, no need, Lieutenant.

276
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:46,399
Actually, on second thought,

277
00:10:46,402 --> 00:10:47,998
I think I should make 100% certain

278
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:50,978
of Maze's guilt before
I find and punish her.

279
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:52,313
Come on, partner.

280
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:54,116
Okay.

281
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,377
Hmm. We'll take my car, shall we?

282
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:10,390
So romantic, the California
coastline, isn't it?

283
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:13,092
- Yeah. Yeah, it really is.
- Mm.

284
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:14,983
Speaking of...

285
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:17,496
That beach date that
you went on with Pierce,

286
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:19,431
was it a date date?

287
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:21,416
Um, it was just a regular date.

288
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,427
Ah.

289
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,902
Well, you're free to spend your...

290
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:25,904
your spare time with
whomever you choose.

291
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:27,972
I mean, I'm not one for
gorilla-sized ham hands

292
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:31,675
or stale alcohol breath or,
yeah, just the general blokes,

293
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:34,521
but I suppose there's no
accounting for taste, is there?

294
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:36,312
No. No, there's not.

295
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:37,848
No... also, I-I'm surprised

296
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,451
that you'd date someone so on in years.

297
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:42,553
Huh? What are you talking about?

298
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:44,422
Oh, believe me, Pierce is, uh,

299
00:11:44,424 --> 00:11:46,623
well, he's much older than he looks.

300
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,092
And we all know that dating
older men has its downsides:

301
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:51,245
performance, stamina, you
know, the important bits.

302
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:52,211
Okay, Lucifer...

303
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:54,531
Well, I just hate to see
you unsatisfied, that's all.

304
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:57,143
Lucifer, I'm not
discussing this with you.

305
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:58,568
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

306
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,803
Besides, Pierce and I,
we're not even sleeping to...

307
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,638
You know, we're not...

308
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,207
We're not, and never mind,
and it's none of your business.

309
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,875
So, how far are we? Are we there?

310
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,748
Uh, we're nearly there.

311
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:10,551
Okay.

312
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:15,417
Thank you for talking
with us, Mrs. Channing.

313
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:18,220
Please, call me Margo.

314
00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:20,689
Tragic news.

315
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:22,756
We want to help any way we can.

316
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,013
Great. Um, well, what can
you tell us about Mike?

317
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:26,545
Well, Zack would know better.

318
00:12:26,548 --> 00:12:29,596
He's the winery foreman
and Mike's supervisor.

319
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,432
- Okay.
- He was a good worker.

320
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:33,000
Quiet. Never gave us any trouble.

321
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,536
Mm-hmm. And did you all
know he had a criminal record

322
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,071
and that he was currently out on bail?

323
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:38,706
No, I wasn't.

324
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,407
It's always the quiet ones, isn't it?

325
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:42,041
The truth is,

326
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:44,311
if we looked too closely
at all our workers,

327
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:45,979
there'd be no one left
to tend the grapes.

328
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,947
Way I saw it, Mike was a good guy.

329
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:49,516
He deserved better.

330
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,951
And did you notice anything
strange in the last few weeks?

331
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:52,939
Uh, any fights

332
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:55,193
that he got in or money
troubles? Anything like that?

333
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:56,869
Well, there was something the other day.

334
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:58,104
Someone came looking for him.

335
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:00,993
Ah, was it a... a hot woman, perhaps?

336
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:02,995
Angry? Leather? Lots of knives?

337
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:04,721
Or someone completely different?

338
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:07,393
- Like a dude? Like a fat, happy dude?
- No.

339
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:08,834
What he said.

340
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:10,969
A pretty woman in black
leather came looking for Mike.

341
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:13,671
Right. Well, Morningstar,
one, Decker, nil.

342
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:15,706
- Not that I'm counting.
- Anyhow, carry on.

343
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,408
Uh, Mike was out at the time,

344
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,910
so she hung around his
trailer, then took off.

345
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:22,547
When I told him, he kind
of freaked out about it.

346
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,715
Then I forgot all about it.

347
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:27,334
Uh, could we get a look at that trailer?

348
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:32,789
Oh. Oh, this is lovely, isn't it?

349
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,558
Aha!

350
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,461
Her favorite beverage.

351
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:40,130
Well, surely this is
evidence that Maze is guilty.

352
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:41,931
And well hydrated.

353
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:44,468
Well, let's just wait and
see what the lab has to say.

354
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,236
I'm sure lots of people
drink green tea coconut water.

355
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:48,971
Right.

356
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,737
I told you not to talk to Charlotte,

357
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,479
and you literally did the
exact opposite of what I said.

358
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:58,781
Why bother asking for my advice at all?

359
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:00,949
I couldn't help it, Linda, all right?

360
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:02,285
I'm sorry.

361
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:04,019
She's not your mother anymore.

362
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:05,979
She's a human woman in pain

363
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:07,889
who isn't ready to hear
what you have to say.

364
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:09,558
Well, I disagree.

365
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,893
She's in pain because she
doesn't know the full story.

366
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:15,357
Whether or not she's my mother,
Linda, I owe her the truth.

367
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,557
At least some of the truth.

368
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,631
I didn't go into the celestial details.

369
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:22,752
And she can tell you're holding back.

370
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,839
And now she has more questions.

371
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:26,674
I really thought we decided

372
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:28,041
we weren't gonna do this.

373
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:29,410
You mean you decided.

374
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:31,945
You decided, Linda.

375
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:34,648
Just like how you
decided that we were over.

376
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,418
Point taken.

377
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,078
But Amenadiel, please, ask yourself...

378
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,815
are you doing this

379
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:46,892
because you think it's
what's best for Charlotte,

380
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:49,262
or what's best for you?

381
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,100
Oh, my God.

382
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,136
You guys are so adorable.

383
00:14:58,138 --> 00:14:59,397
I can't even stand it.

384
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,932
Looks like you caught us, Lopez.

385
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:03,275
Uh, hey. Did you get anything
back on the coconut water?

386
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,745
Uh, no, but they are rushing the order.

387
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:08,380
Chloe.

388
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,515
- Hey.
- Pierce.

389
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,083
I, uh, looked into

390
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,511
other known associates of the victim.

391
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,120
Surviving family members, etcetera.

392
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:18,456
- So far, no leads.
- Okay.

393
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,280
Oh.

394
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:21,850
Here, have a seat.

395
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:25,763
- Ah, lovely. Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

396
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:27,164
It's not like there's 20 other chairs.

397
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,165
Ooh!

398
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,466
All warmed up for me.

399
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:31,334
So, any news on our murderous friend?

400
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:32,651
Listen, guys, if Maze did this,

401
00:15:32,654 --> 00:15:34,837
would any of you really be shocked?

402
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:35,838
- Yeah.
- I would.

403
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,240
- No, not at all.
- There's no way.

404
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:39,376
Let me settle it for you.

405
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,412
I did it.

406
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,037
What are you all waiting for?

407
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,188
I just said I did it.

408
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,359
Maze, hold on.

409
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:53,857
You have the right to remain silent.

410
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,912
Anything you say

411
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:56,802
can and will be used against you...

412
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:58,328
Don't have time for all of that.

413
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,231
I'm the big, bad killer,
so let's move it along.

414
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,906
Agreed. Let's book her.

415
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:04,401
Lucifer, it's called due process.

416
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:05,633
She doesn't have to do this.

417
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:07,337
The evidence against
her is circumstantial.

418
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,472
Well, let me help you with that.

419
00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:12,075
Murder weapon should do it.

420
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:14,277
Put it down. Now.

421
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:16,854
All yours.

422
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,250
Come on, boys.

423
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:22,686
You know you want to.

424
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:26,088
- Stand up.
- Oh.

425
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,355
Stand up.

426
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:35,711
I know this looks bad.

427
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:37,199
We have a video,

428
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,858
a murder weapon, and a full confession.

429
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:40,528
I know. It just...

430
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:41,936
It doesn't feel like her.

431
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:43,304
I thought you said you
weren't gonna let your feelings

432
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:44,672
get in the way of this case.

433
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:46,486
- And I'm not.
- Just like you're not letting

434
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,622
your feelings for Lucifer
get between you and me?

435
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,144
W-What?

436
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:51,779
Is there something going on...

437
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:53,647
between you and Lucifer?

438
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,583
No. No.

439
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:59,020
Lucifer and I, we-we're partners.

440
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:00,263
We're friends.

441
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:03,459
Do all your friends give you jewelry?

442
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:05,825
This?

443
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:07,928
Lucifer gave me this as a joke.

444
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,462
It's a funny story, actually.

445
00:17:09,464 --> 00:17:11,932
He says it was the closest I ever came

446
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:13,638
to penetrating him.

447
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:14,773
Which, see,

448
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:17,310
we've never actually had sex.

449
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:18,700
- Oh.
- Never mind.

450
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:20,272
It just... It was funny at the time.

451
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:21,707
Well, we're gonna book Maze.

452
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,879
If you really believe she's innocent,

453
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,482
you're gonna have to
bring in the real killer.

454
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:27,213
I'll start by talking to her.

455
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:30,969
More talking?

456
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:32,372
Less of a conversation,

457
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,219
really, more of a "j'accuse."

458
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,172
We just want to have a chat...

459
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:37,474
As friends,

460
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:39,724
- because that's what we are.
- Are we?

461
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,895
Let's talk motive,

462
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:43,361
because I cannot think
of a single reason

463
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,029
why you would want to kill that man.

464
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,631
Who needs a reason?

465
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,332
I'm just evil.

466
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,153
I mean, that's what
you all think, right?

467
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,468
- No.
- Right.

468
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,928
Look, I've told you already, Detective,

469
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,105
she is doing this to manipulate me.

470
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,273
Well, newsflash, Mazikeen.

471
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,054
I am not taking you home.

472
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,091
Yeah, I heard you the first
time, and I don't care.

473
00:18:00,094 --> 00:18:02,499
This way, I'll end up in women's prison.

474
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:05,036
I heard it's hell on
earth, so close enough.

475
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,856
Right. Well, maybe
orange is the new Maze.

476
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:09,145
Perhaps some time in the clink

477
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:11,308
might actually make you sorry
for trying to control me.

478
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,509
What are you talking about?

479
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:13,997
She could get life in prison.

480
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,891
That's a mere time-out in her lifespan.

481
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,016
All right, let's talk
about the actual crime.

482
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,218
Maze, tell me what happened.

483
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,719
I stabbed a guy.

484
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,353
See?

485
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:26,088
How many times?

486
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,456
Two or three.

487
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:29,392
Or four?

488
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:30,459
You're not even close.

489
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,194
The victim was stabbed ten times.

490
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,195
Right, well,

491
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,330
I was mad,

492
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:36,013
so guess I forgot to count.

493
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,500
Did you happen to follow
the victim to a winery?

494
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:41,114
- Sure.
- Drink anything while you were there?

495
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:42,483
Wine.

496
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:50,245
- Now do you believe me?
- I believe you.

497
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:51,849
- Yes. I knew she didn't do it.
- Yes.

498
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:53,575
You know what this means, Detective.

499
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:54,816
We need to bust Maze out.

500
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:57,294
Let's smuggle her something
she can use to escape.

501
00:18:57,297 --> 00:19:00,794
What happened to "a mere
time-out" in women's prison?

502
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:02,883
Well, we can't punish the innocent,

503
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:05,580
or even the usually guilty
but innocent this one time.

504
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,689
It's the principle of the matter.

505
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:07,939
We have to find the real killer.

506
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:09,963
It's the only way to
keep Maze out of jail.

507
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,265
I hear someone's

508
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,219
headed for jail? I'm ready to draw up

509
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:14,754
the arrest warrant for Mazikeen Smith.

510
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:16,857
Hey, hang on. I'll grab my paperwork.

511
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,305
I'd love to chat with you, Lucifer.

512
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,707
Well, I'm terribly busy,
Charlotte. I'm sorry.

513
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:23,042
It's important.

514
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:26,367
Maybe somewhere a little more private?

515
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,946
Look, I-I really am in a
bit of a rush, Charlotte.

516
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:29,797
Of course.

517
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,199
I just wanted to mention I
met your brother, Amenadiel.

518
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:33,702
Oh, dearie me.

519
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,078
I bet that was a snooze.

520
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:37,521
So you confirm that he's your brother?

521
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:38,781
Well, yes, of course.

522
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:40,574
Well, he had some
interesting things to say,

523
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:42,210
things that you never mentioned.

524
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:44,047
For starters, would've been nice

525
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,650
to know that you were my stepson
before I kissed you that night.

526
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,053
"Stepson"?

527
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,250
- Right.
- Yeah.

528
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,052
That would've been
far preferable, Mum...

529
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:52,355
Mum...

530
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,492
- my dear Charlotte.
- You said "Mum."

531
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,444
Did I?

532
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:56,630
So I was...

533
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,609
I was your stepmom?

534
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:00,011
Well, not anymore.

535
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:01,868
Look, it... it's complicated, Charlotte,

536
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:03,844
and I am horribly
crunched for time, so...

537
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:06,181
Tell me what you know,
and don't lie to me.

538
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:10,853
Please, Lucifer. I feel
like I'm going crazy.

539
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:13,356
Fine.

540
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:16,359
Fine, I suppose you do
deserve to know the truth.

541
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:18,648
Okay, then.

542
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,652
No sense dillydallying.

543
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,564
I really am the Devil.

544
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,375
My brother Amenadiel is a former angel.

545
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:27,011
That time you thought you survived

546
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:29,470
being stabbed by your
junior associate, you didn't.

547
00:20:29,473 --> 00:20:31,539
You died, and your soul
went straight to Hell.

548
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:33,172
Your empty body became a-a vessel

549
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:35,484
for my real mum, the
goddess of all creation,

550
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:36,787
until her celestial light

551
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,423
started bursting out of your midsection.

552
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:40,072
Naturally, I sent her
to another universe

553
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:41,392
so she wouldn't destroy this one.

554
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:42,861
Once she vacated your body,

555
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:44,764
you, Charlotte, came back to life.

556
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:47,167
All right? There we are. All caught up.

557
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:52,151
You wanted the truth?

558
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,552
Well, there it is.

559
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:55,609
Now, I really,

560
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:58,456
really must be going, because
I have an innocent demon

561
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,458
in the clink, but...

562
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,393
if you have any follow-up questions,

563
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,362
please, do feel free to...

564
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,031
ask Amenadiel.

565
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,571
Maze.

566
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:17,440
How you holding up?

567
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,343
Never better.

568
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,577
What do you want?

569
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,146
I'm here to support you.

570
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,028
Okay, I-I will never, ever forget

571
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:26,450
how you helped my brother,

572
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,319
so if there's anything you need,

573
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,854
anything at all, I'm your girl.

574
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,187
Even if I'm guilty?

575
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,890
Well, I don't think that you are.

576
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,450
Even though there isn't

577
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:37,693
one shred of evidence
that exonerates you.

578
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:39,128
Like, nothing. I mean, honestly,

579
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,931
I've never even seen
someone look more guilty.

580
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,867
But...

581
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,801
I have faith in you anyway.

582
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:52,307
Well, there is one thing
that you could do for me.

583
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:53,608
Yeah. Name it.

584
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,611
I could use a hug.

585
00:21:56,613 --> 00:21:59,414
Like you even need to ask.

586
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,383
Bring it in!

587
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:04,152
Mm.

588
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:06,448
Oh!

589
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,070
I was just on my way to find you guys.

590
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:10,388
Got the lab results back from
the green tea coconut water.

591
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:12,693
No match on the DNA,
unfortunately. It was...

592
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:14,828
- Demonic?
- Inconclusive.

593
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,856
But I did find a set of prints.

594
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:19,066
They were yours.

595
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:20,868
Well, if your prints are on that can,

596
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,786
that means someone must've
broke into your house

597
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:24,470
and stolen it from your wheelie bins.

598
00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:26,533
What? Your trash.

599
00:22:26,536 --> 00:22:28,763
I assume you're the one
who throws 'em out for her.

600
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:30,277
And whoever stole the can

601
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,664
could've also stolen
Maze's knife. Which means

602
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,512
- someone's framing Maze.
- Someone's framing Maze.

603
00:22:34,514 --> 00:22:36,481
You guys, I'm really worried about her.

604
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:38,856
She's hurting. When
I hugged her just now,

605
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,085
she hugged me back.

606
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:41,620
She...

607
00:22:41,622 --> 00:22:43,755
she hugged you?

608
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:02,440
Excuse me.

609
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:03,707
You supposed to be here, ma'am?

610
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:11,331
Ms. Lopez! I've heard so much about you.

611
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:13,466
Only been here a couple
weeks, and everyone says

612
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:15,718
you're just an absolute ray of sunshine.

613
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,719
Yeah, that's me.

614
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:18,355
Rainbows, science, God.

615
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:21,028
Oh, uh, uh, just need
your old, uh, John Hancock

616
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:23,769
and your security PIN, uh, to
sign out that file, you know?

617
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:25,005
Protocol.

618
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:27,597
How 'bout a hug instead?

619
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,666
- A Lopez hug?
- Mm-hmm.

620
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,364
Oh, I've heard about those, too.

621
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,802
Must-must be my lucky day. Uh...

622
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:35,972
Oh! Oh, okay.

623
00:23:35,974 --> 00:23:38,013
Um, getting kind of dizzy here.

624
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,576
Um, okay.

625
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,255
Pleasure to really meet you.

626
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:49,234
That other Ella was mean.

627
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:52,070
I can't believe Maze used me.

628
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:53,905
She ruined hugging.

629
00:23:53,907 --> 00:23:55,340
Uh, I'll-I'll take that.

630
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:57,441
Thank you. Lovely.

631
00:23:57,443 --> 00:24:00,500
Go easy on Maze, Ms. Lopez.

632
00:24:00,503 --> 00:24:02,079
What, like you did?

633
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:04,814
Uh, look, yes, I admit
I was a bit miffed.

634
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:07,317
But that's because I thought
Maze was manipulating me.

635
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,078
Now it's clear she
didn't kill that fellow,

636
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,522
it's obvious someone
is manipulating her.

637
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:13,723
Which is a terrible feeling, by the way.

638
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,624
We need to help her.

639
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:16,759
Excuse me,

640
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:19,062
do you know what she
was looking for in here?

641
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:20,805
Maze wanted us to lock her up.

642
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:22,063
- Chloe...
- She's innocent.

643
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,666
The lab results from
the coconut water prove

644
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:24,900
that she's being framed.

645
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:26,239
Then why did she turn herself in?

646
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:29,305
Because she needed
something from this file.

647
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:32,006
The booking sheet from
the Vic's recent arrest.

648
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:33,542
Why is the corner missing?

649
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:35,575
Because that's where
the bail bondsman's name

650
00:24:35,578 --> 00:24:37,612
and address was. A guy named Barry Hill.

651
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:39,448
He's the one who posted the Vic's bail.

652
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,450
- What does she want with him?
- Okay, in order

653
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,118
to frame Maze, someone
had to convince her

654
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,153
to go to the crime scene,
you know, make her think

655
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:47,000
that she was tracking a normal bounty.

656
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:49,522
That's where she found Mike Biltz dead,

657
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:50,991
- with a knife in his chest.
- Yeah.

658
00:24:50,993 --> 00:24:52,159
And pulled it out.

659
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:53,476
That's a pretty good frame job.

660
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:55,770
And since Barry the bondsman
hired Maze to find Mike,

661
00:24:55,773 --> 00:24:57,698
he's probably the one who set her up

662
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,492
or he probably knows who.

663
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:01,067
Wow.

664
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,803
Not bad, Decker.

665
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,805
Thanks.

666
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,172
Are we okay?

667
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:08,489
Yeah. Yeah, we're okay.

668
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:11,043
Uh, look, we'll talk about
it later. But I have to go.

669
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:13,895
Oh.

670
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:17,341
Sorry. Hate to interrupt the canoodling.

671
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:19,419
Which I am so okay with.

672
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:21,114
It doesn't fill me with mistrust at all.

673
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:22,821
But duty calls, Detective.

674
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:25,657
Can't have Maze taking justice
into her own hands now, can we?

675
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:28,527
- Mm-mm.
- No.

676
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,961
Okay.

677
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,991
Hey! What's your problem?!

678
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:06,958
Hey! Which one of you
mid-life crises is Barry Hill?

679
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:08,598
Get out of the lane, lady!

680
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,100
You're blocking the way of the
two-time league champs here.

681
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,070
You must be Barry.

682
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:16,559
You're coming with me.

683
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:18,174
Need to ask you a few questions.

684
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,544
Oh, well, you know,

685
00:26:19,547 --> 00:26:21,644
I'll give you everything you need.

686
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:22,844
After I roll.

687
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:23,976
So do me a favor, honey.

688
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:25,914
Just stay there and
look pretty, all right?

689
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:36,857
What gives?

690
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,527
7-10 split.

691
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:45,032
Gonna be hard to pick that
up with your face caved in.

692
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:50,770
Now, just stay there and look pretty.

693
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:52,622
Okay! Okay, okay!

694
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:55,141
I'll tell you everything you
need to know! Ju-Just let me up!

695
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:57,777
Just let me up!

696
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,923
Lucifer told me... everything.

697
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:02,426
As in everything?

698
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:05,106
As in the whole freakin' enchilada.

699
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:08,310
As in I was possessed by
the goddess of all creation.

700
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,090
But it's all good.

701
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:13,601
Because she's in another universe.

702
00:27:13,604 --> 00:27:14,636
And you believed him?

703
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:15,960
No.

704
00:27:15,963 --> 00:27:18,431
Yes.

705
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:20,833
I don't want to.

706
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:24,200
I was hoping that you
could help clear things up

707
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:26,705
with one simple question.

708
00:27:26,707 --> 00:27:28,373
What's my husband's name?

709
00:27:29,922 --> 00:27:31,776
Um...

710
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:33,511
God.

711
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:34,906
Frey.

712
00:27:35,982 --> 00:27:37,181
Godfrey.

713
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:39,450
- You're lying.
- Charlotte,

714
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:41,590
I don't know what you
want me to say here.

715
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,195
Um, the truth.

716
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:45,590
But a truth that makes sense.

717
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:48,508
Because right now, the only
thing that feels real to me

718
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:50,193
is that I was in Hell.

719
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:51,629
And that's insane!

720
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:53,226
I mean,

721
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:55,465
you can't actually be an angel

722
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,965
and Lucifer can't actually be the Devil.

723
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,637
Because if I believed that, then...

724
00:28:03,406 --> 00:28:05,275
then it would mean that I'm insane.

725
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:16,051
Easy, lady!

726
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:17,486
Okay, what's this all about?

727
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:18,520
Don't play dumb.

728
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:21,200
You called me to bounty Mike Biltz.

729
00:28:21,203 --> 00:28:23,940
And funny thing when I
found him: he was dead.

730
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:25,801
Stabbed with one of my knives.

731
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:29,481
Security camera was a nice
touch though. Made me smile.

732
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:31,434
So why'd you set me up?

733
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:33,534
Okay, yeah. Okay,
someone-someone paid me

734
00:28:33,536 --> 00:28:35,369
to call you, but I don't
know nothin' about any kni...

735
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:37,104
Who paid you?!

736
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:39,762
Some corporate guy called
me. I-I don't know who he was.

737
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:43,047
He said he worked for some
place called, um, Sebastian Corp.

738
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,320
Sebastian Corp?

739
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,601
What's that?

740
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,685
Well, I didn't see that coming.

741
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:56,452
Long-range round, large caliber.

742
00:28:56,454 --> 00:28:58,453
Barry here died from a sniper hit.

743
00:28:58,455 --> 00:29:00,188
Ah, it's definitely not Maze's style.

744
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,258
She prefers her violence up
close and personal, believe me.

745
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,659
Guesstimating the bullet's

746
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:07,329
trajectory, I'd say the killer shot

747
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:10,265
from across the street.

748
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:11,914
Well, an entire bowling team

749
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,367
saw "that crazy hottie"

750
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,062
leave this office right
after the shooting.

751
00:29:15,065 --> 00:29:16,770
Which means she wasn't across
the street when the shots

752
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:18,445
- were fired... she was here.
- Yeah.

753
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:20,441
She couldn't have taken those shots.

754
00:29:20,444 --> 00:29:22,643
But I'm still mad about the hug.

755
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:26,093
Well, if Maze didn't kill the
Big Lebowski here, who did?

756
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:27,652
Maybe somebody who framed her

757
00:29:27,655 --> 00:29:28,821
was tying up loose ends.

758
00:29:28,824 --> 00:29:30,218
But who has beef with Maze?

759
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:32,270
- My money's on someone she bounty-hunted.
- Yeah.

760
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:34,161
Someone she caught
and brought to justice.

761
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:36,340
Surely those miscreants
have the biggest grudge.

762
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:39,047
Well, time to interview
Maze's ex-bounties.

763
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,061
Oh. Fun and games.

764
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,859
Hello.

765
00:29:48,862 --> 00:29:50,694
Tell us how you know Mazikeen Smith.

766
00:29:50,697 --> 00:29:52,831
She hunted me down like a dog.

767
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,774
She came from nowhere.

768
00:29:55,776 --> 00:29:58,243
S-So, what did she do to you?

769
00:29:58,245 --> 00:30:01,913
She ate my goldfish.

770
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:05,406
Then a rain of many sharp knives.

771
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:06,641
And did she do that?

772
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:08,422
No, she did this.

773
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:11,815
Oh, dear. Would you like some Advil?

774
00:30:13,254 --> 00:30:15,493
What?

775
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:17,962
- She...
- Sorry, Detective.

776
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:19,330
Fish caught my tongue.

777
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,205
He tried to tell her he already
paid his parking tickets.

778
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:30,086
You must have been upset
that Maze caught you.

779
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:31,741
Mm. Perhaps you hated her.

780
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:33,734
Hated her enough to frame her.

781
00:30:33,737 --> 00:30:35,971
No. Maze is all right.

782
00:30:35,974 --> 00:30:39,015
After she got me, she bought me a beer.

783
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,688
She taught me how to make a shiv

784
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,923
out of a toothbrush.

785
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:52,297
And you better believe it came in handy.

786
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,028
The nice thing about Maze...

787
00:30:54,031 --> 00:30:55,851
she doesn't judge.

788
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,420
She's a nice lady.

789
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:02,841
Lucifer's always gonna
be in the way, isn't he?

790
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:05,539
All I know is that they
have a real connection.

791
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:07,408
They're a package deal now.

792
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,593
It's like...

793
00:31:09,596 --> 00:31:12,797
Say you fall in love with
a woman who has a cat.

794
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,465
What are you gonna do?

795
00:31:14,468 --> 00:31:16,102
You accept the cat.

796
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:17,604
Because she's worth it.

797
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,851
Lucifer's the cat.

798
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,557
I'd just get rid of the cat.

799
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,025
Come on.

800
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:31,862
We have one more.

801
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:33,965
Bloody hell. Let's cut
to the chase, shall we?

802
00:31:33,968 --> 00:31:36,769
- Mm-hmm.
- Hello. Do you hold a mortal grudge

803
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,968
against bounty hunter Mazikeen Smith?

804
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:41,523
Nah. I should, but no.

805
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:43,460
Maze changed my life.

806
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:44,773
She scared me straight.

807
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:46,117
Oh. Really?

808
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,119
What, bank job? Mob hit?

809
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:49,922
No. Winery gig.

810
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:51,516
Way overpaid.

811
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:53,051
Definitely fishy.

812
00:31:53,053 --> 00:31:57,255
Maze taught me if it's too
good to be true, stay away.

813
00:31:57,257 --> 00:31:58,867
Uh, what winery?

814
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,836
Monte De Oro Winery.

815
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,973
Gorgeous drive.

816
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:04,775
Very romantic.

817
00:32:04,778 --> 00:32:06,929
Lucifer, Margo and Zack are behind this.

818
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:08,098
We got to get to that winery.

819
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,533
You really think that they framed Maze

820
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:10,865
- and killed those two people?
- Yes.

821
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:12,055
And I bet Maze knows why.

822
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:13,692
- Thank you.
- Right. Looks like we'll have to stop her

823
00:32:13,694 --> 00:32:16,828
from actually killing
someone this time. Thank you.

824
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,108
Found you.

825
00:32:37,575 --> 00:32:40,387
Lady, you framed the wrong demon.

826
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,121
"Sebastian Corp"?

827
00:32:57,124 --> 00:32:59,653
Really?

828
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:01,484
It took me a second
after Barry mentioned it,

829
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:03,053
but then I remembered.

830
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:07,157
Four months ago, I tracked
down a bounty named Sebastian.

831
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:09,392
Yeah, real dirt bag.

832
00:33:09,394 --> 00:33:10,894
Drove drunk, killed a girl,

833
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:13,263
and then fled the charges
when his rich mommy

834
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:15,532
and fancy lawyers couldn't save him.

835
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:18,231
Turns out that rich mommy...

836
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:23,973
was you.

837
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:25,843
So why'd ya do it, lady?

838
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:27,576
Sebastian put you up to this?

839
00:33:27,578 --> 00:33:30,747
Prison not agreeing
with Momma's little boy?

840
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:34,216
Sebastian is dead!

841
00:33:34,218 --> 00:33:36,051
Killed in a prison fight,

842
00:33:36,053 --> 00:33:38,676
the prison you put him in.

843
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,520
I had you framed because I wanted you

844
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:42,057
to suffer like he did.

845
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:45,160
My boy is dead because of you.

846
00:33:45,162 --> 00:33:47,474
You blame me?

847
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,099
Sure, why not?

848
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:53,989
Sebastian's a saint.

849
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,809
You're the perfect mom.

850
00:33:55,812 --> 00:34:00,301
And I'm just the big, bad, evil demon.

851
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:04,809
And what would someone truly evil do

852
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:08,912
to the one who framed her?

853
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:26,698
Best help money can buy.

854
00:34:32,285 --> 00:34:36,708
Yeah, I've always wanted to do that.

855
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,545
Done that before.

856
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:44,215
Maze, no!

857
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:46,383
Maze, stop!

858
00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:51,322
Drop the knife. This isn't you.

859
00:34:51,324 --> 00:34:53,490
Isn't it, though?

860
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,226
I destroy things, Chloe.

861
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:57,228
It's what I do.

862
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,461
Friendships,

863
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,264
relationships, apartment walls.

864
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,301
And, apparently, I
killed this lady's son.

865
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:08,790
Maze, I know you didn't kill Mike Biltz,

866
00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:10,606
and you didn't kill Barry.

867
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,204
And her son isn't your fault, either.

868
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:16,566
We're all responsible
for our own choices.

869
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:17,697
And right now,

870
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,598
you have to make one.

871
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:23,303
Maze, you don't destroy everything.

872
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:26,072
Trixie loves you.

873
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:30,491
You're the best babysitter
she has ever had.

874
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:33,361
Other than the time you let
that rock band spend the night,

875
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:36,142
and when you sent her to
school with the pot brownies.

876
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:37,798
But the point is,

877
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,168
no one's perfect.

878
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,569
But what matters most

879
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:43,804
is that you're such a good friend...

880
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:48,076
to Trixie, to me.

881
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:50,878
And I don't know what
you're going through, Maze.

882
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,147
I wish you would talk
to me, but, please,

883
00:35:54,149 --> 00:35:57,251
please put down the knife.

884
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:59,119
Let me help you.

885
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:03,490
Help?

886
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:06,225
You're the reason he won't take me home.

887
00:36:06,227 --> 00:36:08,194
What?

888
00:36:08,196 --> 00:36:10,140
You want a knife, Chloe?

889
00:36:10,143 --> 00:36:11,443
Maze!

890
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:25,129
Brother, are you sure?
I mean, the old you

891
00:36:25,132 --> 00:36:28,133
would never have been okay with this.

892
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:30,569
I don't think we have much of a choice.

893
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,853
Charlotte.

894
00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:37,755
Do you have a minute?

895
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:39,690
Sure.

896
00:36:39,692 --> 00:36:44,094
Just getting ready to check
myself into the loony bin.

897
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:46,563
Charlotte, listen. I owe you an apology.

898
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:50,034
I shouldn't have told you what I did.

899
00:36:50,036 --> 00:36:53,626
Yes. And, well, I suppose

900
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:56,106
that I didn't help things either.

901
00:36:56,108 --> 00:36:58,152
So we are here to make things right.

902
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:00,022
Now, we can't undo
what we've already done,

903
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:01,725
but maybe we can help you move forward.

904
00:37:07,645 --> 00:37:10,056
Last chance to change
your mind, brother.

905
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:12,755
Going once, going twice...

906
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:15,786
Fair enough.

907
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:18,426
You, um, you may want to sit down.

908
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:22,164
Nah. At this point, things
can't get any crazier.

909
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,121
You'd think.

910
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:27,548
Okay.

911
00:37:39,028 --> 00:37:40,781
Oh, no, Luci.

912
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:42,415
We've broken her.

913
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:44,366
Charlotte.

914
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,888
Are you okay?

915
00:37:51,994 --> 00:37:55,795
It's... it's real.

916
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:04,037
Then that means I'm...

917
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:08,173
I'm not crazy.

918
00:38:17,216 --> 00:38:18,816
Hey.

919
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:20,552
Hey.

920
00:38:20,554 --> 00:38:23,988
I've, uh, I've been thinking
a lot about what you said.

921
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,704
About Lucifer, and, um...

922
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:29,894
You know, I need you to know that...

923
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:33,509
he... he and I, we're...

924
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,799
we're good partners,

925
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:38,660
and... we're good friends.

926
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:41,196
And I... you know, I
don't want to lose that.

927
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,439
It wasn't a fair ask.

928
00:38:42,442 --> 00:38:43,907
No. It's-it's...

929
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:46,392
it's also unfair of me

930
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:49,480
to ask you to deal with this, you know?

931
00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:01,990
You want to take me home?

932
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:04,160
I'll take you anywhere.

933
00:39:10,637 --> 00:39:13,464
It's okay. You don't
have to ride with me.

934
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,446
I know. I want to.

935
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,774
I'm here. What do you want?

936
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:58,344
To apologize.

937
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:01,118
Look, I thought you
were manipulating me,

938
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:02,915
but, well,

939
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:05,903
I'm a big enough devil
to admit when I'm wrong.

940
00:40:07,269 --> 00:40:09,736
Anyway, killer caught.

941
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:11,823
Demon exonerated.

942
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:13,720
All good now?

943
00:40:13,723 --> 00:40:16,161
No.

944
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,986
Everything that happened

945
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:20,165
showed me exactly why I need to go back.

946
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,061
I don't understand.

947
00:40:22,064 --> 00:40:23,664
It's all so

948
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,900
complicated here, Lucifer.

949
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:29,731
I mean, caring about
humans always goes wrong.

950
00:40:29,734 --> 00:40:32,235
Feelings suck.

951
00:40:32,238 --> 00:40:34,442
I am not the one who's
supposed to be tortured.

952
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:36,510
You're the one who does the torturing.

953
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:38,114
Yes.

954
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:40,350
So please, just...

955
00:40:40,353 --> 00:40:42,448
take me home.

956
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:45,652
I can't. And not

957
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:48,354
just 'cause of possible
repercussions with Dad.

958
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:50,613
I...

959
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,509
I can't lose you,

960
00:40:52,512 --> 00:40:55,061
Maze.

961
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:56,795
Not you, too.

962
00:40:56,797 --> 00:40:59,030
Oh.

963
00:40:59,032 --> 00:41:01,366
What do you mean, "not me, too"?

964
00:41:01,368 --> 00:41:04,803
The detective.

965
00:41:04,805 --> 00:41:07,372
- Right.
- I just saw her

966
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:09,775
ride off with Pierce.

967
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:13,043
She looked so happy.

968
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:15,980
That's what I want, I suppose,
isn't it, her happiness?

969
00:41:17,984 --> 00:41:20,965
I just wish I knew that
Pierce's intentions were pure.

970
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:27,757
Anyway, point is, you're right.

971
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,461
Feelings and humans suck.

972
00:41:31,463 --> 00:41:33,630
So...

973
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:36,601
at least we have each other.

974
00:41:38,102 --> 00:41:42,371
I'm always gonna be the
consolation prize for you.

975
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,602
You only care about me

976
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:48,039
when you don't have Chloe.

977
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:50,775
- Maze, now hold on. That's..
- No.

978
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:54,216
No one puts me first.

979
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:55,885
Least of all you.

980
00:42:01,726 --> 00:42:03,410
None of you deserve me.

981
00:42:24,246 --> 00:42:26,254
Leaving town?

982
00:42:28,316 --> 00:42:30,751
What are you doing here?

983
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:34,655
You're angry the people
you trust let you down.

984
00:42:34,657 --> 00:42:36,990
Hmm.

985
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:40,993
Which is why we should
work together for a change.

986
00:42:40,995 --> 00:42:42,728
Why would I do that?

987
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,496
I don't even like you.

988
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:47,489
I don't like you either.

989
00:42:47,492 --> 00:42:49,697
But at least I won't
pretend to be your friend,

990
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,282
like everyone else does.

991
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:55,189
Like I said, why would
I do anything for you?

992
00:42:55,192 --> 00:42:57,008
Because...

993
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,811
I can help us both get what we want.
