1
00:00:01,942 --> 00:00:08,027
Well, I must say, Leonard... when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was skeptical.

2
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:14,132
I can't blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.

3
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:23,075
Oh, no, I was wrong. The-the looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber... does add a certain spice.

4
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,048
I've never felt so alive.

5
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:34,776
Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night's recordings.

6
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:35,757
What recordings?

7
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:38,507
Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep?

8
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:42,761
Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it's probably pure gold.

9
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:50,501
So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through 8 hours of what I like to call "Sheldon After Dark."

10
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:53,499
- Hey, Leonard.
- Hey.

11
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:55,268
Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.

12
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,414
Oh, I know. I'm the one who had to buy him the helmet.

13
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:01,043
So, do you have any plans this weekend?

14
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:04,846
Well, most of Saturday's gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we're done.

15
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:06,442
How about you?

16
00:01:06,836 --> 00:01:10,221
Oh, I'm gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time.

17
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,183
Ooh.

18
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:14,486
That's his take on John Wheeler's quantum foam. That should be great.

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,129
Well, if you want, you can come with me.

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,840
Ah, I'd love to, but I'm supposed to hang out with Penny.

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,854
Well, bring her.

22
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:22,375
Well, she's not really into that kind of stuff.

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,851
Yeah, Okay.

24
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:27,579
Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or...

25
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:29,618
you know, over dinner sometime.

26
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,040
What?

27
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,028
Je-Jenga, I win!

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

29
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:09,896
Oh, come on, that can't be true.

30
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:11,479
I did the research.

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,152
Tony the Tiger, Dig'em the Frog, Cap'n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula...

32
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:18,652
Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop.

33
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:22,133
Not one cereal mascot is a girl.

34
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,039
It's a total breakfast sausage fest.

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,203
Are we done with this?

36
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:35,818
Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.

37
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:38,355
Terrific.

38
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,466
Something weird happened and I don't know what to do about it.

39
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,461
What's going on?

40
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:43,995
Sheldon's assistant asked me on a date last night.

41
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,693
How could you do that to me?! You know I've been working it with Alex for weeks.

42
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:50,743
Working it? You can't even talk to her.

43
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,579
I talk with my eyes.

44
00:02:59,684 --> 00:03:02,568
You look like my little cousin when he's dropping one in his diaper.

45
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,831
She knows I have a girlfriend.

46
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:07,292
It's so weird.

47
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,735
Oh, my God. You're loving this.

48
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:10,981
To my bones.

49
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:17,863
I mean, I'm not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It's just nice to have a young, attractive woman...

50
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:19,220
sniffing around the goods.

51
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,479
I both hate you and want to be you.

52
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,155
This is Ryan Gosling all over again.

53
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,841
Aw, gentlemen.

54
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,593
What is on the conversational menu this morning?

55
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,699
Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only 6 to 8 months away from making my move.

56
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:38,081
I didn't steal anyone.

57
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:41,282
Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.

58
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,475
Ye-- Well, that's not acceptable. See, I'm her boss.

59
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:51,603
She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.

60
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:55,899
I'm androgynous?

61
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,492
Ye-- Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.

62
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,679
What do you guys think I should do?

63
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:05,736
I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny...

64
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,679
I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.

65
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:16,695
Oh, I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice.

66
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:21,253
Uh, in the past, I've reached out to each of you individually, but...

67
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:26,398
I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group...

68
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,825
ye-- which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts...

69
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:33,966
I have dubbed, uh... Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies.

70
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:38,417
What is happening?

71
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:44,463
I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation.

72
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:48,175
Uh, to protect those involved, I'll be changing their names.

73
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:49,714
Hmm, who's involved?

74
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:56,641
Well, it-- Uh, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine... uh, who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate.

75
00:04:56,781 --> 00:05:00,839
Uh... Le-let's call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.

76
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,914
You're talking about Leonard.

77
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:07,824
You wha-- No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair...

78
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:10,841
and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy.

79
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:17,796
Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend...

80
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:23,619
Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.

81
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:25,370
It's your assistant Alex, isn't it?

82
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:26,312
Ye-- Wha-- No.

83
00:05:27,554 --> 00:05:28,365
No.

84
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,158
No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.

85
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,139
Wait, what the hell's going on with Leonard and Alex?

86
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,960
Yo-- I-- No, I'm sorry. Who's talking about Leonard and Alex?

87
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:38,537
W--

88
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:41,897
Fine. It's Ricardo and Tondelaya!

89
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:47,403
Wait, Okay, look, it's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really... about her boss...

90
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:51,652
who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice...

91
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:55,698
which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm...

92
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,794
He's usually pretty smart about these things.

93
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:02,198
Ugh! I'm gonna kill her.

94
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:05,313
I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.

95
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:06,414
She's right.

96
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:10,460
But say the word. I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose.

97
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,701
One of them could end up in the backseat of her car.

98
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,250
Or her shower.

99
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:23,753
Okay, Ladies, ladies, please. We're not here to talk about Penny. They're here to talk about me.

100
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:26,842
D'uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainst-- Oh, darn it!

101
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:29,305
All right, I guess the cat's out of the bag.

102
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:31,395
Let me explain what's going on.

103
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:35,029
- Ricardo is really Leonard--
- We know what's going on, Sheldon!

104
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,795
Well, what should I do?

105
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:43,331
Well, Alex is your employee. If she's doing something that's making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.

106
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:45,371
D'oh, no, he's not uncomfortable at all.

107
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:48,840
No, he's loving it. Yeah, w-- He's strutting around like he's 5-foot-6.

108
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,161
What? He's loving it?!

109
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,588
Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.

110
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,800
Talk to her? Well, that's all you've got?

111
00:06:56,802 --> 00:07:01,008
Ye-- With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies, I really expected more.

112
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:03,239
Give me back the T-shirts.

113
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:16,805
Alex.

114
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,073
Check my schedule. What's-- What does my afternoon look like?

115
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:21,592
I think it's pretty wide open.

116
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,041
Oh, wait. Here's something at 4:00.

117
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:26,719
"Give Alex a talking to"?

118
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,891
W-well, that snuck up on us, didn't it?

119
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:32,863
Is there a problem?

120
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:35,279
You get me wrong. Let's not call it a problem.

121
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,417
Let-let's call it an opportunity.

122
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:39,559
To solve a serious problem.

123
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:41,905
What did I do?

124
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,692
W-- You don't know? Oh, you poor dear.

125
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:48,665
But, your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don't even know which way is up.

126
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:56,845
You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.

127
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,499
What? I didn't make a sexual advance on anybody.

128
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,961
You-- Now, there's no need to get defensive.

129
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:05,249
Look, I'm not unsympathetic to your plight.

130
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,596
You-- My father used to say...

131
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:12,833
that a woman... is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.

132
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:16,216
What?

133
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,998
Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.

134
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,828
This conversation is making me uncomfortable.

135
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:26,905
Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now...

136
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:34,036
please understand 'f-- I don't hold you responsible for your behavior...

137
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:36,496
if you see, from an evolutionary standpoint...

138
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:39,477
you're a slave to your desire to reproduce.

139
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:40,882
But during the work day...

140
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,330
when you feel possessed by amorous intent...

141
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:46,366
may I suggest that you suppress it...

142
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:51,369
by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases?

143
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,635
Oh, let's see here. Oh, yes. Uh, check out this oozy doozy.

144
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,026
I have to go.

145
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:03,567
Yeah, what, now, so does this fellow, but he can't without it burning like hot soup.

146
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:11,551
Hey, pretty lady.

147
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:15,100
Oh, you seem extra happy.

148
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:16,201
Uh, I guess I am.

149
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:17,924
Any particular reason why?

150
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,647
Mm, I don't know, just having a good day.

151
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:24,215
This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy. Huh-huh.

152
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:27,312
Mm-hmm. Anything else?

153
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:28,120
Mm...

154
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:32,842
I found this quiz online called "Which Star Trek Character Are You?" and it only took me 4 tries to get Captain Kirk.

155
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:35,535
That's great.

156
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:37,650
Oh. It... was.

157
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:40,393
Hmm.

158
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:42,451
- Well, I'm glad you're having such a great day.
- Yeah.

159
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:46,986
And the one thing that could make it even better... is an evening with my special girl.

160
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:48,306
Oh, and who's that?

161
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,267
What do you mean?

162
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:52,729
Oh, I just didn't know if you meant me or Alex.

163
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:54,744
Um-- Why would I mean Alex?

164
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:57,571
Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it!

165
00:09:58,418 --> 00:09:59,648
Wha--?

166
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,557
Don't play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!

167
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,110
I'm missing something.

168
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,644
Did you say something to Penny about Alex?

169
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:20,663
Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me.

170
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,394
All she did was get mad at you.

171
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,942
Why would you do that?

172
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:29,145
Well, I needed advice about a woman.

173
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:32,734
Well, I would've asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything...

174
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:34,932
it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle.

175
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,114
At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.

176
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:42,768
Yeah? I-- Good to know.

177
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:46,634
You know, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.

178
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:47,848
Hello.

179
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,060
I see.

180
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,041
Y-- W-what time?

181
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:55,089
Oh, very well, then.

182
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,516
Huh.

183
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:59,463
That was the Human Resources Department at the university.

184
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,733
Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint...

185
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,829
accusing me of inappropriate behavior in the workplace.

186
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:08,916
Oh, my God, what did you do?

187
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,069
Hmm, let me think.

188
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:14,938
Nothing. I'm a delight.

189
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,657
Human Resources Department.

190
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:30,060
Human Resources Department.

191
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:32,115
Human Resources Department.

192
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,111
Come in.

193
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,930
Hello.

194
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:39,122
Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.

195
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:39,929
Thank you.

196
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:45,276
Uh, I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.

197
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,638
So I've been told. But I can't understand what she has to complain about.

198
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:53,180
I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history.

199
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:56,757
But there's string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that's for anyone.

200
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:57,695
Yeah.

201
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:02,868
Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity...

202
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:06,118
by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.

203
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:14,314
Cancel my next appointment.

204
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:16,524
This is gonna take a while.

205
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,728
Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.

206
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:24,112
Like what?

207
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:32,929
Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an "egg salad sandwich."

208
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,493
I don't even know what that means, but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it.

209
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:45,689
Yo-- Oh! I see the confusion here.

210
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,939
No, no, A-Alex thought I was singling her out. No.

211
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,860
I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know?

212
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,092
Uh, even you.

213
00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:58,854
You're a slave.

214
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:04,518
I'm a what?

215
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,120
Well, y-you-- I-I'm just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle--

216
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,439
Whuh-ah! Ow!

217
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,394
You can't talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper.

218
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:19,242
Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I'm gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now!

219
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:22,575
Ye-- Wha-- I d-I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here.

220
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:27,850
'Chieve I-- Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen.

221
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:34,738
You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent 2 years using university resources building a 6-breasted sex robot.

222
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:41,757
You know, and-and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as "Brown Sugar."

223
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:46,757
Hofstadter.

224
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:50,409
Wolowitz and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?

225
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,141
Yes.

226
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:55,578
You-- No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn't racist. It-- He's also brown.

227
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:07,518
# I'm sorry Alex hit on me #

228
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:11,806
# Hit on me, hit on me #

229
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:16,682
# Sorry Alex hit on me, I'd no idea I'm cute #

230
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,349
Oh, damn it, you are.

231
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:27,388
Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.

232
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:29,080
I don't care about Alex.

233
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:30,446
Fine, I care.

234
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,039
Okay, I hate that bitch.

235
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:37,206
But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?

236
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:39,211
Of course not. No. Why?

237
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,619
Because... she is pretty and smart, and...

238
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:45,738
when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.

239
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:48,380
- You do that?
- No.

240
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,108
Hang on.

241
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:57,647
Are you feeling insecure? Because that's my thing, and if you take it away, I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship.

242
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,992
Yes, Leonard, I am insecure.

243
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:01,817
Happy?

244
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,779
No, not happy.

245
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:10,286
Why are you smiling?

246
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:14,109
I'm just sorry. I'm ye-- Just... never think of you having feelings like that.

247
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:15,785
- Well, I do.
- Why?

248
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:18,827
Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.

249
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:20,289
Good.

250
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,295
Come here.

251
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,120
I'll tell you a secret?

252
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,159
What's that?

253
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:31,726
With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.

254
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:34,864
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Sure.

255
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:38,405
Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we're all gonna stop.

256
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:41,889
Message... received.

257
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,952
Excuse me.

258
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,006
Hello.

259
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,237
This is Dr. Hofstadter.

260
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:55,608
Okay.

261
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,156
All right, thank you.

262
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:01,431
That's weird.

263
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:03,451
Getting called in to Human Resources.

264
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:06,980
What did you do?

265
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,326
I don't know.

266
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,849
Huh.

267
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:13,657
I just got called in to Human Resources.

268
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,567
Why?

269
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:16,663
I don't know.

270
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:20,222
Huh. That is so strange.

271
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,660
Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.

272
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:25,114
Could you stop licking your ass for 2 minutes?! I have a problem here!

273
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,262
Do you really think you should be drinking right now?

274
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:42,335
How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?

275
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,094
I don't know. You'd seek professional help?

276
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:49,849
I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.

277
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:55,681
Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?

278
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:57,965
- Sheldon threw us all under the bus.
- Oh.

279
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:00,504
I feel like I've been called down to the principal's office.

280
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:03,186
Although I wouldn't mind if Brown Sugar suspended me.

281
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,727
From a sex swing!

282
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,209
This may've been a mistake.

283
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:18,276
Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. Yeah, before I met Bernadette I was... in here every other day.

284
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:23,267
Uh, little tip. Turn off your "I Like Big Butts" ringtone before you go in.

285
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,497
What-- This is all your fault.

286
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:28,628
How is this my fault?

287
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:31,239
If you weren't screwing around with Sheldon's assistant, none of this would be happening!

288
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:33,089
I wasn't screwing around with anyone.

289
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,568
Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.

290
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:42,484
Ah... Mr. Wolowitz, it's been a while.

291
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:43,948
Hey, Janine. Huh.

292
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:45,357
How are Tom and the kids?

293
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:47,685
- Fine.
- Hm.

294
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,531
You must be Dr. Hofstadter.

295
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:52,267
Yes, but I-I think this is all a big misunderstanding.

296
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:54,694
Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn't do anything.

297
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,560
Is that alcohol on your breath?

298
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:57,998
Howard built a sex robot.

299
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:06,584
That is not true. All I did was build a robot.

300
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:08,111
Did it have 6 breasts?

301
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,012
I'm sorry, I'm a feminist. Heh.

302
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,435
I don't notice things like how many breasts a robot has.

303
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,741
Well, hello.

304
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:19,107
What are you doing here?

305
00:18:19,184 --> 00:18:21,261
Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.

306
00:18:21,262 --> 00:18:22,683
And I'm a little busy right now.

307
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,631
D-- But I came to file a complaint.

308
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:28,110
Yeah, somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace...

309
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:31,296
by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.

310
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:32,334
And who was that?

311
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:33,720
Well, you, you dirty birdie.

312
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:40,216
I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I'm deeply offended.

313
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:42,774
Ye-- Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.

314
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:46,428
That's it. All of you, in my office now!

315
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:53,443
And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you're menstruating.

316
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:59,265
And based on your behavior, I don't have to.

317
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:05,369
It has been pointed out to me...

318
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:11,445
that... some of the things I said to you could be construed as... offensive...

319
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:16,875
and... I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.

320
00:19:17,202 --> 00:19:18,510
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

321
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:26,593
Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar...

322
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,378
so... this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future.

323
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:30,760
- Okay.
- Yeah.

324
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:32,432
Now, unfortunately...

325
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:37,625
uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this.

326
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:39,514
So... um...

327
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,298
I'm gonna need you to take it for me.

328
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:47,603
Yo-- Oh! And, uh, you'd better ace it. They're pretty mad.

329
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,520
So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.

330
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,306
Oh, would you stop worrying about that?

331
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:05,061
Uh-huh. I can't help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure...

332
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:06,606
or I could do something about it.

333
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:10,529
So I got a course catalog at school and looked at some of the science classes.

334
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:11,817
That's great.

335
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:15,772
No, it isn't. They are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day?

336
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:22,021
Anyway, I decided I don't need to be a scientist, I could just look like one.

337
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:23,002
So I bought these.

338
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,008
- Glasses?
- Mm-hmm.

339
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:29,855
I really don't think that's gonna change-- Oh, my God, you look so smart and hot!

340
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:33,070
I know, right? Watch this.

341
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,111
Molecules.

342
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,833
Okay, come with me.

343
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:44,991
Where are we going?

344
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:47,595
To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses...

345
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:50,402
and maybe the boots.

346
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,132
