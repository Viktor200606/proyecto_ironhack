1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:01,793
Previously, on Lucifer...

2
00:00:01,796 --> 00:00:04,266
Someone is forcing those wings on me.

3
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:06,102
I'm sure it's all a part of God's plan.

4
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:07,549
If you mean His plan to continually

5
00:00:07,552 --> 00:00:09,578
manipulate and control me, then agreed.

6
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:12,255
I really appreciate how
you handled the whole

7
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:14,812
"me not wanting you and
Amenadiel to bone" thing.

8
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,117
I do really like you.

9
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:21,041
You can't die, I know.
But I promise you,

10
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:22,464
I will find a way to end

11
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:23,629
your infinite misery

12
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:25,801
if it's the last thing I do.

13
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:27,796
Thank you for your help, mate.

14
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:30,105
No worries. This actually gives me time

15
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:32,440
to brainstorm a little
problem of my own.

16
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:34,043
Aah!

17
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:36,145
I don't understand.
How does this not work?

18
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:37,879
You still have no idea how to kill me.

19
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:45,352
Lucifer, I'm here.

20
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:48,355
Are you ready?

21
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,758
Lucifer?

22
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:56,863
Why is it so dark in here?

23
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:58,165
Wha...?

24
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:01,702
Lucifer?

25
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:06,539
Lucifer?

26
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,869
Detective.

27
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:11,711
There's been a change
of plan. I'm not going.

28
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:13,979
What? But we have a case.

29
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:16,849
Something's happened. Please leave.

30
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:19,251
Wait, what's happened? Are you okay?

31
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:20,586
I can't...

32
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:23,756
I can't make them go away.

33
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:25,791
Wha...?

34
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:27,151
Lucifer,

35
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,061
- what's on your back?
- Detective,

36
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:32,330
I said leave!

37
00:01:32,332 --> 00:01:34,599
What's going on?

38
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:37,435
I can't...

39
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:40,438
I can't control them.

40
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:44,865
No! Detective!

41
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,099
Detective!

42
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:52,146
Detective, grab my hand!

43
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:54,618
Detective!

44
00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:57,988
No!

45
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,763
No...

46
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:02,058
No!

47
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,960
And then I woke up.

48
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:07,029
And it's not the sort
of dream I'm used to.

49
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:08,464
A lot less nudity.

50
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,832
So what do you think it means?

51
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:11,200
Well, I think it's pretty obvious

52
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:12,468
what it means, Lucifer.

53
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,372
That I need sturdier guardrails?

54
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,552
Or, maybe there's some
symbolism in there.

55
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,458
- You mean my wings, don't you?
- Yes.

56
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:20,861
Well, clearly, you have issues.

57
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:21,982
Well, you would, too,

58
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:23,178
if your father slapped

59
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,013
a pair on your back.

60
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:28,159
Took away your Devil face,
took away who you are.

61
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:32,120
I mean, who knows what
else He'll take from me.

62
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:35,213
Lux? My... job with the LAPD?

63
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:36,556
Or Chloe.

64
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:42,362
Well, she may be part of
it, but this isn't about her.

65
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:43,964
This is about me.

66
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:46,854
So can we please just focus
on what truly matters here?

67
00:02:46,857 --> 00:02:49,103
- Which is?
- Showing my Father

68
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:50,771
that He can't control me.

69
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:52,838
And He's not as powerful as he thinks.

70
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,473
And how are you going to do that?

71
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,342
By defying Him.

72
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,544
I'm gonna remove Pierce's immortal curse

73
00:02:58,546 --> 00:02:59,958
so he can finally die.

74
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:04,671
There's just one problem, though.

75
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:05,807
Just one?

76
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,010
Everything that I've come up with,

77
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:09,789
Pierce has already tried.

78
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,877
I'm completely out of ideas.

79
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,427
My well is dry, and
that is why I'm here.

80
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,929
Yeah, well.

81
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,597
Not sure I know how to
remove an immortal's curse.

82
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,799
No.

83
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,900
I need you to remove my mental block.

84
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,970
Hypnotize me, or something.

85
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,573
I hear it works with
smoking and insomnia, so...

86
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:32,510
Unfortunately, that's
not how it works, Lucifer.

87
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,313
There's no easy fix for a lack of ideas.

88
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,081
No?

89
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,249
No.

90
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,907
You just have to be patient.

91
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,479
You never know when or where
inspiration will strike.

92
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:45,743
Well, thank you, Doctor.

93
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:49,081
For being completely unhelpful today.

94
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:02,871
Ah.

95
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:05,274
Hi, Amenadiel.

96
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:13,034
Hey, Ella?

97
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:14,603
Um...

98
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:16,839
Uh, listen, about tonight?

99
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:19,155
- I'm gonna have to...
- No!

100
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,737
No.

101
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,687
You better not be
cancelling on me again.

102
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,690
I know, I'm so sorry.

103
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:26,966
It's just, I have so much work to do.

104
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:27,987
Can't you play hooky?

105
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,295
Not if I want to be

106
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:30,513
a responsible adult.

107
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,098
Right.

108
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,500
But...

109
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:35,434
What if...

110
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:38,333
you weren't a responsible adult?

111
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:42,534
Just this once.

112
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:44,376
Come on!

113
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:45,877
Chloe,

114
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,290
I mean, don't you ever
miss just having stupid fun

115
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:49,659
like when you were a kid?

116
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:52,883
I was a pretty grown-up kid, actually.

117
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:56,587
Well, never too late to start.

118
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,990
I know. I'm sorry, babe, I can't.

119
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:02,660
Can we do a neon party rain check?

120
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:07,467
Decker, one of these days,

121
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,494
you're gonna realize
what you've been missing.

122
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,435
It looked so cute on you.

123
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,347
This is the longest you've
ever gone without talking.

124
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:31,916
Ever. Is something on your mind?

125
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:33,217
Nothing.

126
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,819
That's the problem.

127
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,187
Uh, how so?

128
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:38,208
Well, I...

129
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:41,224
I have this puzzle that I need to solve,

130
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:42,861
but I've hit a mental block.

131
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:44,138
- Okay.
- Have you ever just

132
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:45,591
ran out of ideas when working

133
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,630
a particularly difficult case?

134
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,733
I mean, before I came along, of course.

135
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:51,341
Right.

136
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:54,370
Um... not really.

137
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:55,982
I-I mean, I've hit dead ends

138
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:57,524
from lack of evidence,

139
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:00,976
but no, because there's
always a new angle to consider.

140
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:03,379
Braggart.

141
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:10,495
Our victim's name was Kathleen Pike, 33.

142
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:12,120
She's the author of a best-selling

143
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,505
futuristic Y.A. series

144
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:15,808
called Class of 3001.

145
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:17,659
She was found with her head bashed in

146
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:19,528
by her own vintage typewriter.

147
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:20,995
The irony's a little on the nose.

148
00:06:20,998 --> 00:06:22,430
Or on the head, should I say?

149
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:24,107
What's that white stuff?

150
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,867
I know what you guys are thinking.

151
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:27,536
She's a synthetic.

152
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:29,784
Aliens.

153
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:31,920
The android who bled white.

154
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:37,031
No one? Really? Oh, never mind.

155
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:38,945
That's melted ice cream, anyway.

156
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:41,314
It looks like our victim was
about to dig in last night

157
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:43,817
when someone showed up and
rewrote her dessert menu

158
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,218
with that typewriter.

159
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,497
Real wound's over here though.

160
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:51,027
Huh. Who found the body?

161
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,495
Kathleen's editor. Vincent Green.

162
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:53,629
He's out by the pool.

163
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,031
Thank you.

164
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:57,700
Uh, Daniel.

165
00:06:57,702 --> 00:07:00,503
- Your head is mostly empty.
- Huh?

166
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:03,268
Exactly. And yet, you manage
to do this improv thing.

167
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,432
How do you come up with
stuff on the spot like that?

168
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:08,376
Well, the first rule of
improv is "yes, and..."

169
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:10,049
Yes and what?

170
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:12,466
That's the name of the technique.

171
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,069
Right. I've heard you
talk about it before,

172
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:15,831
but I don't actually
understand what it means.

173
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,471
Well, you agree with
whatever's being said... yes.

174
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:22,357
And then you say the first thing
that comes to your mind... and.

175
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,459
That makes no sense.

176
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,791
But I'm desperate, so I'll try anything.

177
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:28,401
Yes, and.

178
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:30,755
I got the call from
Kathleen late last night.

179
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:32,288
She finally finished the new book.

180
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,925
We made plans for me to
come over this morning,

181
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:35,142
pick up the manuscript.

182
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:37,479
Do you usually pick up
manuscripts in person?

183
00:07:37,482 --> 00:07:38,572
With Kathleen, yes.

184
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:39,940
There's only ever one hard copy

185
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,375
since she does all her
writing on that typewriter.

186
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:43,876
Yes, and... well, her dying

187
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:45,776
on that typewriter as well, it seems.

188
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,613
Do you know anyone who
would have done this to her?

189
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:48,557
Any known enemies?

190
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,650
No, Kathleen was extremely well-liked.

191
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:52,588
She had millions of devoted fans.

192
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,287
Ugh, I know how fans can get
obsessed with their idols.

193
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,272
Yes, and... with their boobs.

194
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,490
Like after you did Hot
Tub High School, Detective.

195
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:00,734
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- You don't think

196
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:02,182
this could be my fault, do you?

197
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:04,496
- Why?
- I was so excited that she was finished

198
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:06,205
that I tweeted the news to her fans.

199
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,474
I really talked the book
up, hinting at this huge

200
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:11,026
action-packed robot rebellion
ending she teased me with.

201
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,332
Well, as long as you didn't
tweet her address as well.

202
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:15,202
No, of course not, but
someone could find that.

203
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:16,738
Someone who wanted to
read the book first?

204
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,971
Yes, and... someone
who wanted to tell her

205
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:21,508
that robot rebellions couldn't
be more dull and derivative.

206
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:23,310
What is with all this "yes, and" stuff?

207
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:25,046
Oh, just some improv thing I was hoping

208
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,781
would knock me out of my idea dry spell.

209
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:29,510
But you're literally just saying
what you would normally say,

210
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:31,409
with the words "yes,
and" in front of it.

211
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,820
Yes, and... it's clearly not working.

212
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:35,656
- Uh-uh.
- Stupid Daniel.

213
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:36,857
Idea dry spell.

214
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,025
Just like Kathleen.

215
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:38,977
What do you mean?

216
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,924
She had the worst case of
writer's block I've ever seen.

217
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:44,618
Took her five years to figure
out how to end the series.

218
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:46,979
Well, never mind that.
How did she cure her block?

219
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:49,936
I don't know, she said I would
understand after I read it.

220
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:52,004
Said she even explained
how she broke through it

221
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:53,419
in the book's afterword.

222
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:54,540
But you haven't read it.

223
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:55,941
No, like I said, there's only one copy

224
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:57,076
and I haven't seen it.

225
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,552
Detective.

226
00:08:58,555 --> 00:09:00,146
This afterword could explain how

227
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,198
to overcome my own
form of writer's block.

228
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:04,383
- What?
- We need to find it.

229
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:06,886
The killer. You mean we
need to find the killer.

230
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:09,049
Exactly. So they can
hand over that book.

231
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:10,454
Uh-huh.

232
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:16,326
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

233
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,984
Mmm. Linda, I have to say,

234
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:28,022
these last few weeks have
been absolutely incredible.

235
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,524
Wow.

236
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:32,336
You're really good at this
sweet, sappy stuff, aren't you?

237
00:09:35,697 --> 00:09:37,497
I feel the same.

238
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:39,866
Good.

239
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,216
Well, maybe someday

240
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:44,320
we can actually have
this date in public?

241
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:53,041
I do hate sneaking around, but Maze.

242
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:55,911
I know. I know. She can't find out.

243
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,347
I...

244
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,716
I want to tell her,
I just don't know how.

245
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:04,186
I admit, I'm afraid.

246
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,308
Well, you should be. Maze would...

247
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:08,737
not take this well.

248
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,992
I feel so guilty, I....

249
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:12,948
I've been avoiding her calls.

250
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:14,336
Are we being cowards?

251
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,730
Yes.

252
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:17,195
But, Linda, it's...

253
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:19,267
- Maze.
- Maze. I know.

254
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,735
Do you know how she's doing?

255
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:22,659
I'm sure she's fine.

256
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:25,562
Busy hunting bounties and all.

257
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,243
But...

258
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:33,280
I can check on her if
that'll make you feel better.

259
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:36,016
Really? Just to make sure she's okay.

260
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:38,285
Of course.

261
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:40,086
I would do anything for you.

262
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,290
What? Is that too sappy?

263
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:57,602
"Max was plagued with confusion.

264
00:10:57,605 --> 00:11:00,961
"If Jessica truly loved him,
then why'd she kiss Tristan?

265
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:05,243
"And in the back seat of
her flying car, no less."

266
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:07,512
This has sold millions of copies.

267
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:10,482
Tongueless kissing and stealing
liquor from their parents.

268
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:13,952
I mean, where's the sex? The drugs?

269
00:11:13,954 --> 00:11:16,754
That robot rebellion
cannot come soon enough.

270
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:20,190
Was your high school
experience this pathetically PG?

271
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,893
I didn't have much of a
high school experience.

272
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,662
Oh! Played hooky a lot did you?

273
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:26,089
Suddenly I like you more.

274
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:28,432
No, child actors don't have
much time for regular school.

275
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,734
You're either auditioning or on set,

276
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:33,536
- so it's mostly tutors.
- Ah.

277
00:11:33,538 --> 00:11:36,238
Maybe I did miss out on a lot.

278
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,740
Anyhow, why are you reading those?

279
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:38,745
I doubt that that's gonna

280
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:39,940
lead us to Kathleen's killer.

281
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:41,547
Oh, well, Kathleen's afterword explained

282
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,012
how she overcame her writer's block.

283
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:45,214
In order to understand,
I may need context.

284
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:47,141
Oh, in case she uses examples?

285
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:49,918
Exactly. So, speaking of the killer,

286
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,620
any leads?

287
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:52,988
Yeah, actually.

288
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,070
Someone who goes by the name of

289
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:57,703
"Ashley3001fan."

290
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:01,029
Got into some pretty heated
online arguments with Kathleen.

291
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:02,573
Apparently, she wasn't too happy

292
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:04,617
the book was taking so
long to be completed.

293
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,189
Poor Kathleen. When will
people understand writer's block

294
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:08,591
is a very serious condition?

295
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,925
Well, Kathleen agreed.

296
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:10,929
"I don't have to answer

297
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,429
to ignorant trolls like you.

298
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,644
There's a reason I'm the writer

299
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:14,767
and you're a fan.

300
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,004
Maybe you should try contributing

301
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:17,177
something to society."

302
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:18,914
Ouch, nicely put, Kathleen.

303
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:21,148
Yeah. After Kathleen
publicly berated her,

304
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,800
Ashley went completely offline.

305
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:25,463
You think Ashley was so
humiliated by her hero

306
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,565
that she wanted revenge?

307
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:28,221
It's possible.

308
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:31,124
Well, let's hope so 'cause
I need to find that boo...

309
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:33,292
Killer, the b... killer.

310
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,236
I know you mean book.

311
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,566
I did.

312
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:43,168
Hi, Amenadiel.

313
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,471
Hey, Trixie. Uh, is Maze here?

314
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:48,473
Sorry, no.

315
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:50,409
Oh.

316
00:12:53,993 --> 00:12:56,594
Would you mind telling her
that I stopped by, please?

317
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:57,862
Sure.

318
00:12:57,865 --> 00:12:59,459
Thanks.

319
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:08,459
Nice work, Trix.

320
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:10,795
Why don't you want to see him?

321
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:12,347
Amenadiel's nice.

322
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,431
Nice?

323
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:16,232
If he were nice,

324
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:19,323
he wouldn't be sneaking around
behind my back with my friend,

325
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:21,872
and lying about it.

326
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:23,253
Why are they doing that?

327
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:25,378
I don't know. 'Cause they suck.

328
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:27,077
Mommy says that sometimes,

329
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,942
people are just scared
to tell the truth.

330
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:31,911
Maybe they need a little help.

331
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:34,513
That's not a bad idea, kid.

332
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,718
Helping people tell the
truth is kind of my thing.

333
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,543
Huh.

334
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:48,725
I cybertraced Ashley3001fan to here.

335
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,428
And the ice cream from the crime scene,

336
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,897
also from here.

337
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,162
- Ashley could be one of these three.
- Yes.

338
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:56,331
They do seem like the insipid Y.A. type.

339
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:59,004
Though, scooping frozen treats
for others day in, day out,

340
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,505
seems even more boring.

341
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,107
Yeah, but they get to hang
out with their friends.

342
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,737
There's no adult responsibility.

343
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,309
It looks like they're having fun.

344
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,011
You know, stupid fun.

345
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,262
Since when do you like "stupid fun"?

346
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,831
Hi.

347
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:15,225
Detective Decker, LAPD. I'd
like to ask you all some...

348
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:19,023
- Freeze.
- Ha.

349
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,624
"Freeze," good one.

350
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,026
Please.

351
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,401
Please don't call my mom.

352
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:25,878
I-It's just one joint.

353
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:28,631
Claire? What's going on?

354
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,633
Claire?

355
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,568
You're not Ashley?

356
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,003
No, I'm Ashley.

357
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,072
Ashley's a man?

358
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,487
Yeah, I'm a man.

359
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,935
And I'm the manager. What's going on?

360
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:41,378
Oh, what's going on, Ashley,

361
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,911
is you need to give me that book.

362
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:44,612
Otherwise, I'll show
you the true meaning of

363
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:46,514
"you scream for ice cream."

364
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:48,516
Okay?

365
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:49,912
All right.

366
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:58,401
I'm gonna ask you nicely, Ashley.

367
00:14:58,404 --> 00:14:59,830
Where's the book?

368
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,151
Dude, I'm telling you.
I don't have any book.

369
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:08,917
Then why was that found
at Kathleen Pike's home?

370
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:12,287
"3000 and Yum."

371
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:15,890
Yeah, that's a flavor I
created special for Kathleen.

372
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:17,458
I brought it to her house personally.

373
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,860
Do you always bring ice
cream to your murder victims?

374
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:22,950
Murder?

375
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:24,585
Wait...

376
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:26,153
Kathleen's dead?

377
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:27,223
Very.

378
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,594
Man, she was the greatest

379
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,177
writer of our generation.

380
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,279
What?

381
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:33,082
Her books were about high school drama.

382
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:35,874
What could a man of your age
possibly find great about them?

383
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:38,611
I mean, high school was
the best time of my life.

384
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:42,915
Reading 3001 makes me
feel like I'm 16 again.

385
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:45,151
Those books are deeper than you think.

386
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,205
We know about your online
fight with Kathleen.

387
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,888
Things got very heated.

388
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,024
Must've hurt to have
her insult you like that

389
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:53,169
in front of everybody.

390
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:54,650
I never should've said those things.

391
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,262
So, I sent her some of my writing.

392
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:57,755
You know, like an olive branch.

393
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:59,286
Hold on, you're a writer?

394
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:00,710
Yeah, man. I've written, like,

395
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:03,300
tons of Class of 3001 fan fiction.

396
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:06,637
Can't imagine that
Kathleen was too pleased.

397
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,473
Kathleen liked my writing.

398
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:10,981
She even asked me to help
her finish her last book.

399
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:12,844
She asked you to help?

400
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,103
So Kathleen's solution to
writer's block was to outsource?

401
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:18,182
Yeah, but when Kathleen read my version,

402
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:20,985
she decided she wanted to
go in a different direction.

403
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:24,075
But she said it did help her
f-finish her book on her own.

404
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:25,644
So... boom.

405
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:27,714
It did? How?

406
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:30,893
What exactly helped
Kathleen overcome her block?

407
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,802
She told me she realized

408
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:35,730
she needed to be more authentic.

409
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:38,334
You know, get back to
her original inspiration.

410
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:41,570
That is completely meaningless.

411
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:45,475
Well, well, what was
the original inspiration?

412
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:48,944
Oh? You guys don't know?

413
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:51,713
So, the characters in Kathleen's
books are based on real people.

414
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:53,215
And all of her stories were taken

415
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:54,682
from her real life at Westside High,

416
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:55,817
right here in L.A.

417
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:58,453
Max, Jessica, Isabel.

418
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:00,658
She didn't even change
any of the first names.

419
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:03,028
Did she have any original ideas at all?

420
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:04,292
Well, she changed the last names.

421
00:17:04,294 --> 00:17:05,691
And she did have to come up

422
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:07,260
with all that futuristic sci-fi stuff.

423
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:09,230
I mean, trust me, that is not easy.

424
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:10,898
I'm actually writing my own book

425
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,166
about a forensic scientist

426
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:14,035
- who talks to ghosts.
- You are? Tell me,

427
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:15,569
what do you do when
you run out of ideas?

428
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:18,005
Oh, I never run out of
ideas. I've got way too many.

429
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:19,444
My problem is how to choose.

430
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:21,080
Well, there's no need to rub it in.

431
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,809
- Thank you.
- So, this author exposed

432
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:24,177
all these people's dirty laundry?

433
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,545
Sounds like motive to me.

434
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:26,946
Uh, I think Charlotte...

435
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:29,012
uh, Ms. Richards is right.

436
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,316
If, uh, someone saw the editor's tweet

437
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,853
announcing another book, then
maybe one of them killed her

438
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:35,321
to make sure it didn't come out.

439
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:37,857
Ella.

440
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,630
The main characters

441
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:41,325
from the Class of 3001...

442
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:44,196
If the book's gonna reveal
any secrets, it's theirs.

443
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:45,627
These are our suspects.

444
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,301
Right. Prom king, sexpot, cheerleader,

445
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:52,371
bad boy, valedictorian, jock.

446
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:54,939
One of these six degenerates
has my book. Let's bring them in.

447
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:58,009
No, all you have is speculation.
Not enough for arrest warrants.

448
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:00,044
I mean, even if we
did bring them all in,

449
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,651
we don't have any
leverage. Why would they

450
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:02,447
admit to anything?

451
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,148
Well, according to superfan Ashley,

452
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,683
Kathleen was rushing to
get her book done in time

453
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,151
to announce it at her
high school reunion,

454
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,486
which is tomorrow night.

455
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:09,620
Well, if all our suspects

456
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,194
are in town to attend,

457
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:12,697
gave them opportunity.

458
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,051
Mm-hmm. And it gives us
an opportunity as well,

459
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:16,085
to go undercover.

460
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:18,095
- Well, good. What are we waiting for?
- Well,

461
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,163
it's a high school reunion.
Everybody knows everybody.

462
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,358
Unless... you're Todd Cornwell.

463
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:24,937
Who's Todd Cornwell?

464
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,444
Exactly. Todd Cornwell.

465
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:29,046
Class loner, acne,

466
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,443
Coke-bottle glasses, whole bit.

467
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:31,912
Went to college overseas,

468
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:34,408
and when I stalked
Kathleen's classmates online,

469
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,490
Todd was the only one with
zero social media presence.

470
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:39,955
Lucifer, you could go as Todd.

471
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:43,978
Yeah, no, no, seriously.
Look, he looks just like you.

472
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,709
Has all that masturbation
finally caught up

473
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:46,912
with your eyesight, Daniel?

474
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:48,481
No one'll believe that
even if I tell them

475
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:50,217
I've had a face and body transplant.

476
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:52,008
Yeah, but it might be our only shot.

477
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:53,327
I mean, I could go as your plus-one.

478
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:54,855
Oh, poops. Hold up.

479
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:57,157
Todd RSVP'd "yes."

480
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:00,260
Charlotte, is there any legal way

481
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:01,818
to prevent him from attending?

482
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:05,595
Well, it's definitely not legal

483
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:07,865
to distract Todd with,
say, a bounty hunter.

484
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:10,036
If anyone needs me, I'm
gonna be in my office

485
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:11,270
not hearing the plan.

486
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:13,849
Okay, great. Are you gonna call Maze?

487
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:17,310
Gladly, whilst you
research our suspects.

488
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:18,868
Enjoy.

489
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,305
Maze.

490
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,490
I'm so glad you're here.

491
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:27,518
Yeah, well, you seem pretty busy.

492
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,155
I called a couple of
times. Never heard back.

493
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:33,424
Yeah, I know, work's been crazy.

494
00:19:33,426 --> 00:19:37,680
Oh. I was hoping that
maybe you found a boyfriend.

495
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:38,996
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah.

496
00:19:38,998 --> 00:19:42,132
Why would I...

497
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:43,734
Definitely no boyfriend.

498
00:19:43,736 --> 00:19:45,269
- Really?
- Yup.

499
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:48,672
So single. So... so single.

500
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:51,141
Well, in that case, I
should totally set you up.

501
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:52,599
I have just the guy.

502
00:19:52,602 --> 00:19:55,144
Oh, that it so thoughtful of you, Maze,

503
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:56,861
but you really don't have to do that.

504
00:19:56,864 --> 00:20:01,110
Please, Linda, I want to.
What are best friends for?

505
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:03,185
I know, it's just me and blind dates...

506
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:05,508
- How about tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night?

507
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:09,392
Oh... shoot. I think I'm busy.

508
00:20:11,662 --> 00:20:13,195
Let me do this.

509
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:15,730
Tomorrow it is.

510
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,313
No.

511
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,282
Mom?

512
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,541
Baby, what are you doing
up? Get back in bed.

513
00:20:37,544 --> 00:20:39,540
Bed? It's morning.

514
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:41,655
I'm gonna miss the bus.

515
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,823
What?

516
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,791
I've-I've, uh...

517
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:45,586
I've been up all night?

518
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:47,421
Come on, come on. Get the...

519
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:51,160
Get-get, go, get your... Where's the...?

520
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:05,344
Oh.

521
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,778
Wow.

522
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,047
You know, high school reunion's

523
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,669
a very popular torture in Hell.

524
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:11,802
This is beautiful.

525
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:14,832
I... you know, you didn't
even try to look like Todd.

526
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:16,670
Well... well, why would I do that?

527
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,310
If I was Todd, I'd want to look like me.

528
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:20,224
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, look.

529
00:21:20,226 --> 00:21:21,555
It's Emily and Bo,

530
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:22,825
Tristan and Jessica,

531
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:24,727
and there's Max talking to Isabel.

532
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,280
She is so not good
enough for him, really.

533
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:29,416
What did you just say?

534
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,438
Max and Isabel, two of our suspects.

535
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,405
Oh, oh!

536
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:37,107
The prom king and the sexpot.

537
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,508
Oh, Lucifer, don't judge.

538
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,243
They're so much more to these people

539
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:41,811
than their stereotypes suggest.

540
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:42,879
Right.

541
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:43,981
It's just, ugh.

542
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:45,215
Are you being serious?

543
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:47,308
Yeah. Yeah, the books are much deeper

544
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:48,677
than you'd imagine.

545
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,279
The characters, they're
so compelling and relatable

546
00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:54,523
and rich, and I-I mean...

547
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:55,691
They're all here.

548
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:57,693
And one of them is most likely a killer.

549
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:59,195
Right.

550
00:21:59,197 --> 00:22:00,463
- Right.
- Right.

551
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:01,998
Okay, I'm gonna go sign us in

552
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,200
so that we can finally meet the, um...

553
00:22:04,202 --> 00:22:07,536
so we can question the suspects.

554
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:10,825
What is happening?

555
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:16,520
Okay, so we each have
three people to question.

556
00:22:16,523 --> 00:22:18,123
Let's figure out who was worried about

557
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,590
Kathleen's book coming out.

558
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:21,893
Yes, and where everyone
was the night of the murder.

559
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:23,194
Oh, yeah.

560
00:22:23,196 --> 00:22:24,862
Are you even listening to me?

561
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:26,679
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you know,

562
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:27,885
I can't believe I'm saying this,

563
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:29,165
but focus, Detective.

564
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:30,379
I need that afterword.

565
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,969
- Right, sorry.
- Right.

566
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:33,170
- Oh, my God.
- What?

567
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:34,771
It's Jessica.

568
00:22:34,773 --> 00:22:36,006
Can you believe

569
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:38,199
that sophomore year, she
hooked up with Tristan

570
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:40,398
on the laserball field?

571
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,580
Don't worry, Jessica's on my list.

572
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,934
Okay, so, I'm the first one here.

573
00:22:47,937 --> 00:22:50,447
I'll just go have a drink at the bar.

574
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,949
- Sure thing.
- Linda.

575
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,048
Amenadiel, what are you doing here?

576
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:56,551
Well, Maze invited me.

577
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:58,871
I thought she wanted to talk
after I stopped by yesterday.

578
00:22:58,874 --> 00:23:02,030
Maze is setting me up on a blind date.

579
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:03,964
What if you are my blind date?

580
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,533
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

581
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:08,236
Unless she knows about us and
is trying to make us squirm.

582
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:10,505
And torture is her thing.

583
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:12,039
Linda,

584
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,999
this is Todd.

585
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:16,202
Your date.

586
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:17,499
Hello.

587
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:19,398
This is a blue lobelia.

588
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:22,368
Native Americans used
them to treat constipation.

589
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:26,186
Thank you.

590
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:31,437
But what are you two doing here?

591
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:34,127
Double date.

592
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:36,396
Isn't this great?

593
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:39,452
Hmm.

594
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:41,746
Yeah, uh, no...

595
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:43,468
Hi.

596
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:45,805
That's great.

597
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:53,945
Excuse us. Isabel.

598
00:23:56,316 --> 00:23:57,449
Todd?

599
00:23:57,451 --> 00:23:58,905
Odd-bod Todd?

600
00:23:58,908 --> 00:23:59,817
Are...

601
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,179
I'm sorry. You...

602
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:04,282
just look so different.

603
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:05,718
I'll take that as a compliment.

604
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,187
Wow, I...

605
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,522
Do you have a British accent?

606
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:10,760
Well, I've had many
accents over the years,

607
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:12,430
but this one is clearly the best.

608
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:17,501
You're so funny and... so hot.

609
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:19,303
- I know.
- Mmm.

610
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:22,171
Uh, but I need to ask
you a few questions.

611
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:24,207
Sure. Let's catch up.

612
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,944
Can you believe Kathleen's
coming out with another book?

613
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:28,544
Oh, I believe it.

614
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:31,448
That bitch loved profiting off of us.

615
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,982
Ugh, she sucks.

616
00:24:32,984 --> 00:24:36,093
But honestly, we're all,
uh, just trying to move on.

617
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,230
Man, those books ruined our lives.

618
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,905
I had to move to Maine.

619
00:24:39,908 --> 00:24:41,474
Do you know what was in her last book?

620
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:43,147
What sparked her final idea?

621
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:45,928
The books are about you, correct?

622
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,665
- Oh, for...
- So, do you know

623
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:50,999
what happens in the new book?

624
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:52,333
Are there any big secrets

625
00:24:52,336 --> 00:24:53,635
that come out or...

626
00:24:53,637 --> 00:24:55,804
Does Isabel actually get pregnant?

627
00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:57,840
Uh, who are you again?

628
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:59,274
What were you doing two nights ago?

629
00:24:59,276 --> 00:25:00,991
I was... at home?

630
00:25:00,994 --> 00:25:02,294
Doing a facial.

631
00:25:02,297 --> 00:25:03,730
I was with Tristan.

632
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,462
I think.

633
00:25:05,465 --> 00:25:07,687
I mean, by the time I flew
in, it was really late.

634
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,457
You're hiding something.

635
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,918
And I think I know what.

636
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,765
It's because you were with Bo,

637
00:25:12,768 --> 00:25:14,465
and you didn't want Isabel to find out.

638
00:25:14,468 --> 00:25:16,156
But, like, who cares what Isabel thinks?

639
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:18,959
Especially after what she
did to you in chemistry class?

640
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:21,327
I mean, do you realize you're
still lucky to have your hand?

641
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:23,196
It doesn't matter where
I was two nights ago.

642
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:27,467
What matters is that
tonight, we're together.

643
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:30,837
So where were you two nights ago?

644
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,406
Let's go talk somewhere
a little quieter.

645
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,875
Right.

646
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:37,910
Yeah, talk. Uh-huh.

647
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:43,152
You two have so much in common.

648
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:44,167
Yeah.

649
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,985
Linda, you're a therapist.

650
00:25:45,987 --> 00:25:47,179
And, Todd,

651
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:49,053
you're in therapy.

652
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,288
Discuss.

653
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,990
Oh.

654
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:53,725
- You don't have to...
- I wet the bed.

655
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:58,630
It's more common than people think.

656
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:00,097
You're lovely.

657
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,999
I'm so glad she convinced me
to skip my reunion for this.

658
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:05,765
Most serial killers wet the bed.

659
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,807
I smell a love connection, don't you?

660
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,309
Let's crank this date up a notch.

661
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:14,477
Waiter.

662
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:16,499
Linda.

663
00:26:16,502 --> 00:26:18,148
This is getting out of control.

664
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,366
We just have to get through
tonight. We can do it.

665
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:25,991
So, Todd.

666
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:27,823
Any hobbies?

667
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:30,059
I make my own toothpaste.

668
00:26:32,797 --> 00:26:34,530
Where were you two nights ago?

669
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:36,077
Uh...

670
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,399
Come on, Tristan.

671
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:38,968
I can't remember.

672
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,413
Well, try.

673
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:42,003
I told you, man,

674
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:43,605
I don't, I don't remember where I was.

675
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:44,539
Oh!

676
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:47,175
Tell me the truth now.

677
00:26:47,177 --> 00:26:48,810
Okay. A couple nights ago,

678
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:50,582
we all broke into the school pool.

679
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:53,314
You know, just a little party
before the party, you know?

680
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:54,515
Well, why is that a secret?

681
00:26:54,517 --> 00:26:56,785
Because we didn't invite everyone.

682
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:58,832
Well, you, for instance.

683
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:00,788
What? I'm sorry, man.

684
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,456
If we knew how cool you had gotten,

685
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,924
we totally would've invited you.

686
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:07,094
So what you're saying is
you all have the same alibi?

687
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,098
Wasting our time here.

688
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:14,568
Where's the detective?

689
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,469
I dig you, Chloe.

690
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,605
You... you're different.

691
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:21,173
Too bad you didn't go
to high school with us.

692
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:22,609
Yeah.

693
00:27:22,611 --> 00:27:24,077
That would have been great.

694
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,878
Yeah.

695
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,282
So, you were gonna tell me

696
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:32,018
where you were two nights ago?

697
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:37,188
Is that really what you
want to talk about, hmm?

698
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,980
Well, I mean,

699
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:43,095
I would really like to know.

700
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:45,230
Max!

701
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:47,065
What are you doing? Who is that?

702
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:48,756
- Uh...
- We were talking.

703
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,191
And what do you care?

704
00:27:50,194 --> 00:27:52,965
You cheated on Max with Tristan.

705
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:54,972
That was 15 years ago.

706
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:57,207
- Actually, I am still kind of pissed...
- Right.

707
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,043
- about that.
- I'm sorry I cheated on you,

708
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:01,527
but I only did it because I
thought you slept with Emily.

709
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,380
I would never cheat on you, Jessica.

710
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,516
I know that now.

711
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:06,916
I read 3001.

712
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,218
It showed me how much
you really loved me.

713
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,871
You know, sometimes I think about

714
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:13,389
getting back together.

715
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,490
Mmm.

716
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,525
Me, too.

717
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,569
Oh.

718
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:17,971
What's going on here?

719
00:28:17,974 --> 00:28:20,444
Max, I thought it was gonna be just us.

720
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:22,532
I'm not really down for a four-way.

721
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,968
Make that five.

722
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,554
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but I'm not down, either.

723
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,275
- Oh. So you were sleeping with Emily...
- Oh.

724
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:32,474
Weren't you? And then you
bring this rando in here, too?

725
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:33,676
- I'm not a "rando."
- I-I just met

726
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,843
- this rando.
- We are never...

727
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:36,311
- Hey.
- getting back together.

728
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:37,612
- You didn't tell her about us?
- Jessica, I...

729
00:28:37,614 --> 00:28:38,914
- Us?
- Yes, us.

730
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:40,215
- That's what you said.
- I never said...

731
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:41,749
- Oh, really, Max?
- Anything like that to you.

732
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:44,821
Detective! None of these
people killed Kathleen.

733
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:46,876
- What?
- "Killed"?

734
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:48,079
- What?
- "Detective"?

735
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:49,746
I have discovered that they all

736
00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:50,868
have the same alibi.

737
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:52,537
They broke onto the
campus two nights ago

738
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,820
and had a party by the pool.

739
00:28:53,823 --> 00:28:55,056
Didn't you? Hmm?

740
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:57,498
So, Kathleen's killer, not here.

741
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,478
Look at me, being the responsible one.

742
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:02,306
So that's why you were
all acting so strangely.

743
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,621
Yeah.

744
00:29:03,624 --> 00:29:05,431
Sorry we didn't invite
you, Todd, but, uh...

745
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:06,673
you're not mad, right?

746
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:08,108
You were hanging out
with Kathleen anyway.

747
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,142
What?

748
00:29:09,144 --> 00:29:11,062
Todd was hanging out

749
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:12,431
with Kathleen two nights ago?

750
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,247
Yeah, it's what he said in the e-mail.

751
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:15,948
I did? I...

752
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,517
What? He was an awesome math tutor,

753
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,019
and now he helps me with my taxes.

754
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:21,253
Detective.

755
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:22,957
I think I'm the killer.

756
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:33,145
Apparently, Maze took Todd
to a steakhouse in Hollywood.

757
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,847
It is an odd place for a
kidnapping, even for Maze.

758
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:38,094
And what motive would
Todd have to kill Kathleen?

759
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:40,445
- He's not even in the books.
- Well, exactly.

760
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:42,887
Odd-bod Todd's probably
tired of being left out.

761
00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:44,823
Oh, right, should have thought of that.

762
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,358
Yes, you should have,

763
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,826
but someone was making the
case all about themselves.

764
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,581
Slightly unprofessional,
but I forgive you, Detective.

765
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,517
I know. I can't believe I let myself

766
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,099
get so wrapped up in all of that.

767
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:56,934
Think I was just trying to make up

768
00:29:56,936 --> 00:30:00,253
for all the fun, teenage drama
that I missed out on, you know?

769
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,019
I didn't even get to go to my own prom.

770
00:30:02,022 --> 00:30:04,454
It's ridiculous, I know.

771
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:06,390
No, it's not.

772
00:30:09,814 --> 00:30:13,583
And that's the best way to
clean out an abscessed tooth.

773
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:15,636
How delightful.

774
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,786
I am so glad we did this.

775
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,730
I have missed you guys.

776
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:22,724
I mean...

777
00:30:22,727 --> 00:30:25,964
what's not to miss, right?

778
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:29,231
Mmm.

779
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:31,233
- Mmm.
- Okay, stop.

780
00:30:31,235 --> 00:30:32,417
Uh, that's inappropriate.

781
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,935
We're in a restaurant, Maze.

782
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:35,073
Who cares?

783
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:36,937
I care. I mean, I'm just...

784
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,198
it ju... it just makes me uncomfortable.

785
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:41,001
Oh, it does?

786
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:43,338
Well, does this make
you uncomfortable, too?

787
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,665
Maze!

788
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:47,747
Maze! Why are you acting like this?

789
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,685
Because she knows.

790
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:52,854
You know, don't you?

791
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,490
And you're torturing us.

792
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,330
That is so incredibly mean.

793
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,089
I'm the one who's mean?

794
00:31:01,872 --> 00:31:04,391
You're the ones who've
been running around,

795
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:07,033
lying to me about this fling for weeks.

796
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:08,935
Of course we lied, Maze. Look at you.

797
00:31:08,937 --> 00:31:10,571
You have a tendency to overreact.

798
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:12,074
I do not...

799
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:13,606
- overreact.
- Maze.

800
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:15,274
- Can we just calm down here?
- No!

801
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:17,076
No.

802
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:21,180
I will not take orders from
some pathetic daddy's boy.

803
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:24,676
Tell me, Amenadiel.

804
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,180
Is this the divine purpose
your Father sent you here for?

805
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:29,860
So you can bang

806
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:33,160
some... selfish human?

807
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:35,180
Selfish? Selfish?

808
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:39,163
All I do is listen to your problems!

809
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:40,830
Everyone's problems!

810
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:44,000
So, yeah, for once, I put myself first

811
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,203
and did what makes me happy.

812
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,672
So, sue me. Or torture
me. Or better yet,

813
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:51,141
why don't you just skewer
me with one of your knives?

814
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,043
But before you do,

815
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:56,513
know that this wasn't some fling,

816
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,785
that what Amenadiel and I found

817
00:31:58,788 --> 00:32:02,290
was completely unexpected,

818
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:05,261
but 100% real.

819
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,127
But you were my friend.

820
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:20,622
Maze?

821
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:23,363
LAPD, drop the weapons.

822
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,995
Yes, I indeed visited
Kathleen two nights ago.

823
00:32:33,998 --> 00:32:35,578
The night she was murdered.

824
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,985
Kathleen was murdered?

825
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:39,761
Oh, my.

826
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:45,099
And y-you think I did it.

827
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,164
Of course you do.

828
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,632
The weirdo.

829
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:53,434
The outcast.

830
00:32:53,436 --> 00:32:56,636
I'm used to people judging
this book by its cover.

831
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:58,871
That's why I swore off social media.

832
00:32:58,873 --> 00:33:02,342
I still don't even know how
Kathleen tracked me down.

833
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:04,110
Kathleen tracked you down?

834
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:05,712
She wanted to discuss

835
00:33:05,714 --> 00:33:07,947
the final installment
of her series with me.

836
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:09,482
Well, why would she
talk about that with you?

837
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:10,727
You're not even in the books.

838
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,651
Yeah. I was surprised, too.

839
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:16,021
Turns out, not only was
she going to include me

840
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:17,389
in the final book,

841
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:19,325
she was making me the hero.

842
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:22,060
Wait, h-hold on, does that
mean she let you read the book?

843
00:33:22,062 --> 00:33:23,662
Uh, no.

844
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:25,397
She didn't want me to read it yet.

845
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:27,466
Kathleen was waiting for the reunion.

846
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:29,828
She was excited about
finishing it in time

847
00:33:29,831 --> 00:33:31,164
to show everyone there.

848
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,571
So you have no idea
what's in the afterword?

849
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:35,606
The afterword? No.

850
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:39,532
But she did tell me
about the story itself.

851
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:41,346
How it had

852
00:33:41,348 --> 00:33:43,581
a peaceful, grounded ending.

853
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:47,336
No scandals, no
insiders versus outcasts.

854
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:49,018
Just...

855
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,985
people finally understanding each other.

856
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,424
The way she described it, it...

857
00:33:56,027 --> 00:33:58,027
it sounded beautiful.

858
00:33:58,029 --> 00:33:59,896
- And boring.
- And not at all like

859
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:01,498
the action-packed robot ending

860
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,198
that the editor told us about.

861
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,633
I smell a new theory brewing.

862
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:06,344
I got to go make a phone call.

863
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:08,237
Mr. Green.

864
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,773
Hi, uh, Detective Decker, LAPD.

865
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:12,274
Detective, how can I help you?

866
00:34:12,276 --> 00:34:13,642
Um, I was just wondering,

867
00:34:13,644 --> 00:34:15,511
did Kathleen ever talk to you

868
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,646
about working with a ghostwriter?

869
00:34:17,648 --> 00:34:20,625
A ghostwriter? No, wish she had.

870
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:22,485
Maybe she would have
finished the book sooner.

871
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:23,818
Oh, I see.

872
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,055
So-so, she never mentioned
a-a fan-fic writer

873
00:34:28,057 --> 00:34:29,696
named Ashley Collins?

874
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,250
He's a-a manager at an ice cream shop.

875
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:33,661
I think the name's Scoop Science.

876
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:35,586
Actually, yeah, Kathleen
did mention some sort

877
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:38,321
of overeager fan who invented
some special flavor for her.

878
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:40,033
Kind of creeped her out.

879
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:41,334
Wh-Why are you asking?

880
00:34:41,336 --> 00:34:43,003
Is this Ashley a suspect?

881
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:46,093
Oh, well, I can't divulge any
of that information at this time.

882
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:48,696
But you've been incredibly
helpful, Mr. Green.

883
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,577
Thank you.

884
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:52,846
You in the mood for some ice cream?

885
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:12,347
Hello, Vincent.

886
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,692
Looking for Ashley? Sorry to disappoint.

887
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:19,775
- What are you doing here?
- Drop the gun.

888
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:22,612
You're under arrest for
the murder of Kathleen Pike.

889
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:24,280
You lied to us, Vincent.

890
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:26,115
I called Ashley. He confirmed

891
00:35:26,117 --> 00:35:28,518
that the robot ending was his
version and not Kathleen's.

892
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,886
- Th-That means nothing.
- But it is suspicious.

893
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:32,486
So I looked at traffic footage.

894
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:34,627
You went to Kathleen's house
the night of the murder.

895
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,825
But, Detective, didn't
he tell us he didn't go

896
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:38,485
over there till the next morning?

897
00:35:38,488 --> 00:35:41,619
Fine. Yes, I was at
Kathleen's that night.

898
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:44,705
If you had waited five years
for that damn book like I did,

899
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,662
you wouldn't want to wait
another second for it either.

900
00:35:46,664 --> 00:35:48,597
But once you got it, you
didn't like what you read,

901
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,170
- did you?
- I was horrified.

902
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:52,907
She ended the series in the
most boring way possible.

903
00:35:52,909 --> 00:35:54,525
And you were worried about the sales.

904
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:55,910
We'd lose millions

905
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:57,912
without the right ending. Ashley's.

906
00:35:57,914 --> 00:36:00,180
So you and Kathleen argued
over which one to use.

907
00:36:00,182 --> 00:36:02,182
She refused to use the good version.

908
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:05,485
So, yeah, I threw her
stupid typewriter at her.

909
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:07,286
But even with Kathleen gone, you knew

910
00:36:07,288 --> 00:36:09,854
that you couldn't publish
Ashley's ending as hers.

911
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:12,258
So you came here to tie
up the one loose end.

912
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,193
Now, tell me, Vincent...

913
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:16,529
Kathleen's manuscript,

914
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:17,597
where is it?

915
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,685
I don't have it.

916
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:19,885
I destroyed it.

917
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,167
You did what?

918
00:36:21,169 --> 00:36:24,269
I couldn't let anybody read
that pathetic joke of an ending!

919
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:25,775
But I needed to read the afterword

920
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:27,172
so I could fix my problem,

921
00:36:27,174 --> 00:36:28,870
- and now you're saying it's gone?!
- Lucifer,

922
00:36:28,872 --> 00:36:29,842
back off.

923
00:36:29,844 --> 00:36:30,995
What did it say?

924
00:36:30,998 --> 00:36:32,330
- The afterword?
- Yes!

925
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,939
How did she fix her block?

926
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,807
I don't know! She said inspiration came

927
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,950
when she realized she couldn't go back

928
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:39,116
and change what she'd done.

929
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,799
Well, that doesn't help me at all!

930
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:41,652
Lucifer, stop!

931
00:36:41,654 --> 00:36:43,921
Now I'm never gonna figure out how to...

932
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:54,025
Are you okay?

933
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:55,869
No, Detective.

934
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:57,857
Far from it.

935
00:37:11,255 --> 00:37:14,330
Remind me to never go on
another blind date ever again.

936
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,869
Mm-mm. Oh, I don't know,

937
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:19,722
I thought you and Todd
really made a connection.

938
00:37:21,592 --> 00:37:23,721
Okay, so I've been thinking.

939
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:25,427
- Yeah.
- A lot.

940
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,505
Pretty crazy what Maze did.

941
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:32,675
I'll say.

942
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:34,245
But she was right.

943
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:37,872
We never should have lied to her.

944
00:37:37,874 --> 00:37:40,731
And I never should have lied to myself.

945
00:37:40,734 --> 00:37:42,959
Yourself?

946
00:37:42,962 --> 00:37:44,622
What do you mean?

947
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:48,181
As much as I tried to
tell myself otherwise,

948
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,771
I knew what we were doing
was going to hurt her.

949
00:37:51,774 --> 00:37:53,554
And I did it anyway.

950
00:37:53,556 --> 00:37:56,389
That's how much I wanted
to be with you, Amenadiel.

951
00:37:58,878 --> 00:38:01,278
Look, you've made me
happier than I've been

952
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,631
in a long, long time.

953
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,632
But...

954
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,544
I was being selfish.

955
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:10,036
Maze is my friend.

956
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,169
I can't be with you anymore.

957
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:21,947
Not when it does this to her.

958
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,333
You know, it's not fair for
her to take this away from us.

959
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:31,389
I know. I don't expect
you to understand.

960
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:35,460
But I don't want to
be that kind of person.

961
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:38,188
It's just not who I am.

962
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:42,661
Actually, I do understand.

963
00:38:42,664 --> 00:38:44,234
Um...

964
00:38:44,236 --> 00:38:46,971
I may have strayed
from who I am as well.

965
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,852
So I guess this is it.

966
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:06,333
I guess so.

967
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:18,161
Lucifer!

968
00:39:18,164 --> 00:39:19,234
I'm here.

969
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:20,836
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes,

970
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:22,303
I wanted to check on you.

971
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:25,741
That you were back to
being the good detective.

972
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:28,176
"The good detective"?

973
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:30,266
Mm. Well, I like our
partnership much better

974
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,599
when you do all the work and
I'm the fun, irresponsible one.

975
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:34,782
Oh. Yeah.

976
00:39:34,784 --> 00:39:37,570
I did get a little carried
away at that reunion.

977
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:38,852
Just a smidge.

978
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:43,323
Y-You know, it made
me realize something.

979
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:46,466
All of that high school
drama that I missed out on...

980
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:48,630
The-the girly gossip,

981
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:50,196
the hallway crushes,

982
00:39:50,198 --> 00:39:52,666
all those school dances...

983
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:55,201
That's just not who I am. I...

984
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:58,672
I like being the responsible adult.

985
00:39:58,674 --> 00:40:00,306
Right.

986
00:40:00,308 --> 00:40:04,591
So you no longer desire any
of that high school poppycock?

987
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:06,779
No.

988
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:09,314
Well then...

989
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:13,219
I guess you won't be wanting this.

990
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,121
Detective...

991
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,649
will you go to the prom with me?

992
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,919
I can't believe you did this.

993
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,539
Thank you, Lucifer.

994
00:41:15,078 --> 00:41:17,700
I'm just glad you got what you needed.

995
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:21,724
But you, you never
found that inspiration

996
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:23,417
that you were looking for.

997
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:27,212
Are you ever gonna tell me what
it is you were trying to solve?

998
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:31,216
Uh, it's-it's complicated.

999
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:34,261
Well, tell me anyhow?

1000
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:35,863
Very well.

1001
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:38,220
A long time ago,

1002
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:41,122
dear old Dad put a curse on a...

1003
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,970
well, a friend of mine.

1004
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:45,675
And I want to break that curse,

1005
00:41:45,678 --> 00:41:48,278
show my Father He's not
as powerful as He thinks,

1006
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:50,209
that He can't control him.

1007
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:52,316
Or me.

1008
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,952
Well, crazy metaphor aside,

1009
00:41:54,955 --> 00:41:57,028
can I offer some advice?

1010
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:58,757
Oh... please.

1011
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,485
If I've learned anything
from this experience,

1012
00:42:02,488 --> 00:42:04,355
it's that it's better to move forward

1013
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:06,023
than stay stuck in the past.

1014
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:09,176
It's just like Kathleen realized.

1015
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:11,579
We can't rewrite history.

1016
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,291
You can't.

1017
00:42:17,294 --> 00:42:18,827
But maybe I can.

1018
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,305
Detective, you're a genius.

1019
00:42:21,308 --> 00:42:22,432
Thanks?

1020
00:42:22,435 --> 00:42:24,573
You've just given me my idea.

1021
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:26,577
All I need to do is go back

1022
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,421
and undo the reason it
exists in the first place.

1023
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,695
Oh.

1024
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:33,124
Thank you.
