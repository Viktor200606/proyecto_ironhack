1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:02,785
- Previously on Lucifer...
- You are my brother

2
00:00:02,788 --> 00:00:04,562
and my test. So what's the plan?

3
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:05,528
We need to make

4
00:00:05,531 --> 00:00:06,640
the detective realize

5
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:07,842
that Pierce isn't the man

6
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:08,744
she thinks he is.

7
00:00:08,747 --> 00:00:10,146
If we don't get Chloe to love you,

8
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:11,515
then I can't kill you,

9
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:14,353
and I need this to get back to Hell.

10
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:15,658
I like you, Charlotte.

11
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,259
So, if you need time, I can wait.

12
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:18,595
You're worth it.

13
00:00:18,598 --> 00:00:20,575
What do you desire?

14
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:23,232
- I want her to choose me.
- Then tell her.

15
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:24,967
Chloe Decker, will you marry me?

16
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:26,453
Yes.

17
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:30,614
Are you listening?

18
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:32,661
Get a move on.

19
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:33,781
What part of

20
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:37,412
"she can't perform without
it" do you not understand?

21
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:39,434
Great. Just great.

22
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:43,247
This is the agility trials
in San Fran all over again.

23
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,358
Run.

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,390
Run!

25
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:57,433
This is an heirloom.

26
00:00:57,435 --> 00:00:59,468
Only the best for Bootsie.

27
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:05,793
And now, introducing last
year's grand prize winner,

28
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:09,311
Bootsie.

29
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:11,313
Situation sorted.

30
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:12,429
You wish.

31
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:15,917
Cornelia's up next and
no one's laid eyes on her.

32
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:19,789
Ms. Cornelia, showtime.

33
00:01:23,677 --> 00:01:24,877
Ms. Cornelia?

34
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,184
Oh, my God!

35
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:36,468
Wowzers.

36
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,015
That is some rock, girlfriend.

37
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:40,642
It is exciting, isn't it?

38
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:43,640
Um, yeah, I mean, heart
melting, brain exploding.

39
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:44,742
Wait, clock's ticking.

40
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:46,279
How much time do we
have before the big day?

41
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:47,648
- Three...
- Months?

42
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:48,950
Weeks, actually.

43
00:01:48,953 --> 00:01:50,653
What? That is not enough time to plan.

44
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:52,421
Well, Marcus and I thought why wait?

45
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:53,589
When you know, you know, right?

46
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:54,723
I'm not talking about the wedding.

47
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:57,817
No, I am talking about
the bachelorette party.

48
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,095
Well, it's the second wedding.

49
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:00,953
- Do I need one?
- Uh, yeah, you do.

50
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,331
It sets the foundation for
your whole support system.

51
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,684
And trust me, you're gonna need one

52
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:07,911
for the dark days to
come 'cause, I mean,

53
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:09,947
sleeping with the same dude

54
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,817
for the rest of your life?

55
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,542
Even hot gets boring, Chloe.

56
00:02:13,544 --> 00:02:15,288
Dark days ahead, indeed.

57
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,590
I may have to take my chances.

58
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:18,125
Uh, Decker.

59
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:21,879
All of my life, I have been dreaming

60
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,614
of the chance to plan
a bachelorette party.

61
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:24,954
But four brothers.

62
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:26,288
Remember?

63
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,991
And you're the closest thing
I have to a sister right now.

64
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:30,860
Well...

65
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:32,995
I guess if you're gonna
play the sister card.

66
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:34,263
Yes!

67
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:36,161
Oh, wait. Let's talk theme.

68
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,637
The bachelorette and
wedding should match.

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,825
You know, color palette,
dress, cake, venue, flowers...

70
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:46,142
Playlist, DJ, tuxedo,

71
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,510
- marriage license.
- Right.

72
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:48,750
We have the nice bottle

73
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,382
of single malt for the bar,

74
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:51,780
which is gonna be open,

75
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:53,867
which means we need to
get a couple bartenders.

76
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:56,352
This is a lot, isn't it?

77
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:58,654
It's, uh...

78
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:01,004
Do you think we should
maybe postpone the date?

79
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:02,036
Is that what you want?

80
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,259
No. No.

81
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:04,994
Totally and completely no.

82
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:06,428
I... unless...

83
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,712
- unless you do.
- Absolutely not.

84
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:11,116
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

85
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:15,476
I mean, look, we solve murders.

86
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,507
How hard can it be to
plan one little wedding?

87
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,559
Yeah. But I think I know what'll help.

88
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:21,552
- Hmm?
- I recently discovered that a certain detective

89
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:23,926
has weeks of unused vacation days.

90
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:26,883
Couple days away from the office
might give you time to plan.

91
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:31,353
Chloe said yes?

92
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:33,926
- To marry Pierce?
- It's mind-boggling,

93
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:35,224
I know.

94
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:36,668
I mean, when I said I was at peace

95
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,692
with the detective
making her own choices,

96
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:39,903
it didn't occur to me

97
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:43,364
that she'd be capable of making
such a spectacularly bad one.

98
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:44,500
I mean,

99
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:46,004
why on earth?

100
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,503
Why is besides the point, Luci.

101
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:49,270
We can't allow this to happen.

102
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:52,497
Oh, I like this new you.

103
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,754
I wish you'd realized I
was your test eons ago.

104
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:56,590
Luci, it is God's will that you

105
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:58,059
- and Chloe...
- Yeah, don't ruin it.

106
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:59,161
I'm just happy

107
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:01,282
that we're on the same side for once.

108
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:03,252
So, what's the plan?

109
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:06,255
The plan... is simple.

110
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:07,589
The plan is simple.

111
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:09,426
I'm going to try to understand why

112
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:11,060
the detective would want to marry

113
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:12,286
that overstuffed man ham

114
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,906
and then make her see she's deranged.

115
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,265
Or you could just tell her how you feel.

116
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:20,502
I already missed my window
for that, unfortunately.

117
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:23,105
He's weaseled his way into her heart,

118
00:04:23,107 --> 00:04:24,973
and I don't understand how,

119
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:26,828
but I need to.

120
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:28,177
Well, good luck.

121
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,793
And I will come up with a
plan that will actually work.

122
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:31,880
Of course you will.

123
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:35,484
Ah, Detective.

124
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,019
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

125
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:39,954
Uh, anyway, since changes are afoot,

126
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:41,856
I'd like to address things head-on.

127
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:44,727
Oh. Well, that's oddly mature of you.

128
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,729
And it's... it's nice to know

129
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:48,622
that you're not gonna
start acting all weird.

130
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:54,737
Oh, what's this? Is
this an engagement gift?

131
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,981
It's much better than that.
It's a personality test.

132
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:59,309
So I can understand why
you do the things you do

133
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:01,512
and, uh, decide the things you decide.

134
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:02,930
A personality test?

135
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,332
So much for not acting weird.

136
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:06,804
What? You know, to help
optimize our partnership.

137
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,193
Okay, well, it's gonna have to wait,

138
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:10,747
because I am taking some
time off to plan the wedding.

139
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,065
I... Well, how am I supposed
to get inside your head

140
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:15,668
if I can't watch you at work?

141
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:17,887
The job is who you are, Detective.

142
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,750
Well, how about you watch Dan.

143
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,020
Because my cases have been reassigned,

144
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:24,067
and I'm sure he'd appreciate the help.

145
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,129
Well, looks like it's
you and me, Lucinda.

146
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:33,793
Yippee.

147
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:41,583
- And then there's potential reason number 54...
- 55.

148
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:45,120
55 the detective would accept
Pierce's proposal: drugs.

149
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:47,456
EUI... Engaged Under the Influence.

150
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,790
Or craziest reason yet:

151
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,959
maybe Chloe said yes
because it's what she wants.

152
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:52,426
Well, maybe it's what
she thinks she wants,

153
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:54,161
but does she know
what she truly desires?

154
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,804
'Cause few do unless I help them.

155
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:58,608
And unfortunately, I
can't do that with her.

156
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:01,017
Not peony, penis.

157
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,210
Peni... Yeah, sure, I'll hold.

158
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:06,015
Vic is Francis Hoffman.

159
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:07,442
Time of death roughly 9:00 a.m.

160
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:09,645
- Husband's on his way now.
- Right.

161
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:11,515
Well, aren't you gonna ask

162
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:13,067
about these suspicious paw prints?

163
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,403
The detective certainly would.

164
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:17,386
The prints belong to Cornelia,
the vic's prizewinning Mastiff.

165
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:18,520
Currently AWOL, though.

166
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:20,288
Ah, right. A canine killer.

167
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,898
Seems they can't trust you
with a real homicide, Daniel.

168
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:25,335
Nope. The bitch is innocent.

169
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:27,273
Cause of death was blunt force trauma,

170
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:28,906
so the killer is human.

171
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:30,234
You can rush the order?

172
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:31,859
Awesome!

173
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:32,920
Okay.

174
00:06:32,923 --> 00:06:33,922
It's all in here.

175
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:34,924
- Oh.
- I got me

176
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,828
a penis piñata to pick up.

177
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:40,898
Right, well, by now, the detective

178
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,414
- would have formulated a working theory, so...
- Listen, dude.

179
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,023
I know you're going through stuff

180
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:47,007
with this whole
Chloe-getting-engaged thing,

181
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,243
but I can't have you
second-guessing my every move.

182
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:51,344
Chloe has her reasons for making
the decisions that she makes,

183
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:52,712
and I have mine.

184
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:54,929
Only one of us can be detective.

185
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,732
- You're right.
- Yeah.

186
00:06:56,735 --> 00:07:00,203
That is the perfect way to
understand the detective.

187
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:03,041
I'm gonna take the lead and be her.

188
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:04,684
Right.

189
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:07,655
That is not what I meant.

190
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:13,601

191
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:18,411
Francis loved the beach.

192
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:21,247
We just celebrated our sixth
wedding anniversary in Malibu.

193
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:23,384
Two daddies and one fur baby.

194
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,386
Has there been any sign of her?

195
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:27,954
Cornelia's all I have left.

196
00:07:27,956 --> 00:07:31,357
Not yet, but my job
means everything to me.

197
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,693
Solving murders is my one true passion,

198
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:37,096
and as such, I promise you
that I will find Cornelia

199
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:40,033
and get justice for your
slaughtered husband...

200
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:41,968
because I am empathetic.

201
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,002
I care.

202
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,203
Yeah.

203
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:47,305
Will you excuse us for
just a second, please?

204
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,032
Thought you never lied.

205
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,644
What? I do care...

206
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,781
about channeling the detective

207
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:56,516
so I can find out why she
does the things she does

208
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,996
- and makes the decisions she makes.
- Okay, look.

209
00:07:57,998 --> 00:07:59,998
Whatever it is, we
still have to do our job.

210
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,055
You know, like asking
questions relating to the crime.

211
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,090
Okay? Just let me handle this.

212
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,925
Uh, Frederick?

213
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:08,361
Do you know of anyone who
had a beef with Francis?

214
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,495
Anyone who would want to hurt him?

215
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:10,693
Oh, right, that is exactly

216
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:11,964
the sort of futile question

217
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,232
the detective would ask.

218
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:14,407
- Do you?
- I mean,

219
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,511
everyone loved Francis.

220
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:21,513
But he did get into an argument
with someone in the parking lot

221
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:23,242
of the training center last week.

222
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:25,078
- Did you get a name?
- No, I...

223
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,170
I thought they were just
arguing about a parking spot.

224
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:29,005
But I did take down the license plate

225
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,651
in case he came back to key the car...

226
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:33,252
if that's helpful?

227
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:34,387
Is that helpful?

228
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,488
Yeah.

229
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,156
Right. Thank you.

230
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:38,291
I got your message

231
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:39,425
about the engagement.

232
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:40,626
Plan's back on, right?

233
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:41,728
Whoa, easy, there.

234
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,721
Oh, relax. I'm not gonna do it here.

235
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,279
I mean, I remember the plan.

236
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:48,000
Kill you, frame Lucifer,
blah, blah, blah.

237
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:50,297
I'm just really excited.

238
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,338
Well, that's not why I called you.

239
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,841
I called to apologize.

240
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:55,441
Apologize about what?

241
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:57,977
I don't want to die anymore.

242
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:00,294
I'm in love with Chloe.
I want to be with her.

243
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:02,148
I-I know you don't understand.

244
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,417
I hardly do, myself.

245
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,519
You know, I've never
felt like this before.

246
00:09:06,521 --> 00:09:08,588
- We had a deal!
- And I will honor it.

247
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,238
I promise to find you
another way back to Hell.

248
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:13,074
Show me your arm.

249
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,143
Really?

250
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:20,400
I don't get it.

251
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:22,068
If Decker loves you,

252
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,604
then the mark should be gone.

253
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,763
Unless she's having
second thoughts about you.

254
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,241
Well, that's not...

255
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:29,409
Oh, my God.

256
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:31,477
Maze, super psyched you're here.

257
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,679
I got me what you might call

258
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:36,708
an "all hands on Decker" emergency.

259
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:38,701
- Would you...?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,755
- Conference room.
- Yeah.

261
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:46,992
I'll work on Chloe and
get her back on board.

262
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:48,394
In the meantime,

263
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,897
you better figure out that other way...

264
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,900
fast.

265
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:56,702
Is that

266
00:09:56,704 --> 00:09:58,471
a wedding murder board?

267
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,998
I am just trying to stay organized here.

268
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,664
Wow. Mug shot for the caterer.

269
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,732
Nice work, Decker.

270
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,202
- You see what I'm dealing with?
- Mm-hmm.

271
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,032
Guys, solving crimes makes sense to me.

272
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:09,568
Wedding stuff, not so much.

273
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,317
Why do you think Dan and I
got married at the courthouse

274
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,569
and then went right back to work?

275
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,240
Decker, trust me,

276
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:16,883
we will help you deal with
all the wedding details

277
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:18,157
the normal way:

278
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,240
blind drunk at your bachelorette party.

279
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:23,169
- Mm-hmm.
- Which needs to be awesome.

280
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:24,216
That's where you come in

281
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:25,932
while I deal with a
new lead in this case.

282
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:27,200
Oh, the case. Right.

283
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:29,466
- What's going on with that?
- I-I ran a partial license

284
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:30,636
and got a match.

285
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:32,738
Security footage shows the suspect's car

286
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,173
at the location of the murder.

287
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,516
Okay, who is it registered to?

288
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,685
You will never know that

289
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:38,878
because you are on wedding vacay.

290
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,546
All right. My dress.

291
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,315
- I need to get a dress.
- Yep. Mm-hmm.

292
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:43,623
And while you do that...

293
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,693
We will...

294
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:47,490
seal this wedding dealio

295
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:49,583
by throwing you a bachelorette party

296
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:50,923
you won't forget.

297
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:52,443
Thanks.

298
00:10:52,446 --> 00:10:53,713
I think.

299
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,265
Perfect. Okay, so you plan the
pregame till I get off of work.

300
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,399
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God.

301
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:01,534
With you on the case,

302
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,774
this night is gonna be insane!

303
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,365
Yes, we're heading there right now.

304
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:13,202
Actually, we would've
been there 20 minutes ago

305
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:15,314
if someone didn't have to
stop for a wardrobe change.

306
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:16,849
I'm committed, Daniel.

307
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:19,490
Okay, so, uh, Ella tracked
the plate of the guy

308
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:22,396
Francis fought with to an
ex-con named Vincent Walker.

309
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,591
Car was spotted on 3rd and Main.
So we should, you know, hurry.

310
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:26,974
Well, I'm going as fast as I can.

311
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,076
You're going 34 in a 35, man.

312
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,915
I can't risk accidentally
going over the speed limit.

313
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:33,318
The detective wouldn't.

314
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:36,569
Why don't you just ask Chloe
why she said yes to Pierce?

315
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:41,040
Oh, there's no point bothering
the detective on her time off.

316
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:43,586
But speaking of baffling unions,

317
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,612
how are you doing? You and
Charlotte still a thing?

318
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:49,081
Oh, I...

319
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,029
Yeah, she's kind of going
through some stuff right now.

320
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:53,977
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And I'm just...

321
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,788
- you know, I'm giving her space.
- Right.

322
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,922
- Or I'm trying to.
- Hmm.

323
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,691
But thank you for caring, man.

324
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:00,125
Oh, no, I don't care.

325
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,262
Oh, right, right, but Chloe would.

326
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,024
Now you're getting it, Daniel.

327
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:06,618
Just drive, man.

328
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,555
Hey, Amenadiel.

329
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:16,368
- This a bad time?
- I could use a break

330
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:18,969
from prosecuting the Malibu
State water polo team.

331
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,473
Well, I was hoping
that you might be able

332
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:21,780
to help me out again.

333
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,188
I know we failed to prove
Pierce is The Sinnerman,

334
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,751
but I've still been digging,

335
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:28,501
and I am confident that eventually...

336
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:31,024
Actually, I'm taking a different
angle this time, Charlotte.

337
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:32,915
I need to split up the engagement

338
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,317
between him and Chloe.

339
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,396
Any chance to get in
His good graces, I'm in.

340
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,001
The thing is, Pierce seems
to genuinely be in love.

341
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:44,270
To stop this, we would
have to understand him,

342
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:47,579
and that... that guy is impenetrable.

343
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:50,642
Well, if being a trial
lawyer has taught me anything,

344
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,846
it's that there's always a way
to get inside someone's head,

345
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:55,969
get them to have a change of heart.

346
00:12:55,972 --> 00:12:57,165
Go on.

347
00:12:57,168 --> 00:13:00,084
You're both former
immortals that became mortal.

348
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:03,616
You could dig into your
own fears and insecurities,

349
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:04,919
weaponize them.

350
00:13:04,922 --> 00:13:07,118
Not the easiest, I know.

351
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,927
But worthy of a test.

352
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,530
Hmm.

353
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:14,099
Well, while I'm doing that,
perhaps you can work on Chloe?

354
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:16,802
Guess who just got invited
to Chloe's bachelorette party,

355
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:19,171
co-hosted by Maze, of all people.

356
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,639
Bring singles.

357
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:22,352
Exactly.

358
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:25,008
Chloe will be drunk
in some stripper's arms

359
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:28,646
questioning her life choices in no time.

360
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,718
All I have to do is
water the seeds of doubt.

361
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:35,680
Okay, so, Vince Walker's record's

362
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:37,482
chock full of violence, man.

363
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:41,721
Worked as a leg breaker for the mob.

364
00:13:41,724 --> 00:13:43,992
- You gonna pay attention or what?
- Hmm?

365
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:47,399
Oh, yes, whoever wanted Francis dead

366
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:49,555
probably hired this
Vincent chap to kill him.

367
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:50,590
And I'd say,

368
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:52,603
based on the security
around that doorway

369
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:54,106
over there, and the fact I've been here

370
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:57,008
many times before, that
is an illegal gambling den.

371
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:58,577
As such, it's a reasonable assumption

372
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:00,079
that our devious murderer's in there.

373
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:01,163
Nice work. You actually have

374
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,382
this whole Chloe thing down pat.

375
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,626
And yet I'm still no
closer to understanding her.

376
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:07,285
I mean, I'm following all the rules,

377
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:09,391
I'm actually paying
attention to the leads,

378
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:11,568
I'm covering all the
bases like she does.

379
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:12,825
It gives me no time to do

380
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:14,960
the foolish, impulsive
things I normally do

381
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:16,295
that help solve a crime.

382
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:19,865
Oh, hold on.

383
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:22,167
That's it. That's what's
missing: I need a "me."

384
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,836
- A "you"?
- Yes.

385
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:25,371
Well, to truly go full Detective,

386
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:27,985
I require a partner who's
clever and unpredictable,

387
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:31,256
handsome, sexual.

388
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,028
Suppose one out of four will
suffice. Well done, Daniel.

389
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:37,883
Wow.

390
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:39,485
Which one of the four am I?

391
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:42,089
Come on.

392
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:44,792
Yo, Lucifer.

393
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:46,415
Hey.

394
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,907
Thank you.

395
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:57,243
All right, remember, just be me, Daniel.

396
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:00,906
Uh...

397
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,375
Hey, everybody.

398
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,542
Who the hell are you?

399
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,378
I'll show you who I am.

400
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,881
Oh, what the heck happened to my, uh...

401
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:28,501
Uh...

402
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:29,951
What are you looking for, buddy?

403
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:32,089
Trouble? A few lost teeth?

404
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,924
How'd you even get in here?

405
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:38,828
Right. Just be Lucifer.

406
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,594
I'm here for your
money... and your women.

407
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:45,130
Teeth it is.

408
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:46,233
Ah.

409
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,040
You buried the lede.

410
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:58,532
Maze, this is really sweet.

411
00:15:58,535 --> 00:16:01,283
You helping me with all
this traditional bride stuff,

412
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:04,641
and-and for me, it's gonna be
really nice hanging out again.

413
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:07,474
Nice is exactly what I was going for.

414
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:10,992
Yeah. Yeah, right.
Wait, where are we going?

415
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:13,095
There better not be male strippers.

416
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,407
You underestimate me, Decker.

417
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:22,238
- Careful. All right.
- Okay, okay.

418
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,141
- You ready?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm ready.

419
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:28,277
Oh.

420
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,849
Wow. Hi.

421
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:37,453
Yes, I-I definitely never
would have guessed this.

422
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,688
Surprise!

423
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:41,090
It certainly was for me.

424
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:43,593
Care for some non-alcoholic punch?

425
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,267
Come on.

426
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:53,259
Sorry, not sorry.

427
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,729
Loser.

428
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,913
You know what?

429
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:09,051
Maybe this chair'll be luckier.

430
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:12,162
So, hit man's greatest hits.

431
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,857
What's the latest, Vince?

432
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,926
I don't know who you are, but
that stuff was a long time ago.

433
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:19,395
A man of your reputation and skill?

434
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:20,663
I can't imagine you'd retire.

435
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,898
New time, new tune.
Not what I want anymore.

436
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,102
So then, uh, tell me,

437
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:30,840
what do you want or, uh, desire?

438
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:31,951
I'm married, pal.

439
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:35,077
Oh.

440
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:37,079
No, no, I mean, uh...

441
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:40,950
Like, what do you want
want? Not, like, me, like...

442
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:43,621
in life, what do you want?

443
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:46,258
I want to play. Are you in or you out?

444
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,028
Yeah.

445
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:53,810
Is that a dog bite?

446
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:56,365
Oh, don't tell me, scars turn you on?

447
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,103
No, man.

448
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:00,506
It's just that when I
was a kid, I got bit.

449
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:03,172
She was a rescue, Chihuahua.

450
00:18:03,174 --> 00:18:05,193
She had been abused,
but, uh, we kept her.

451
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,920
Pebbles... turned into
a real friend, you know.

452
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:12,841
- Well, this was no Chihuahua.
- What kind of dog was it?

453
00:18:12,844 --> 00:18:14,885
Well... huh?

454
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,571
Go, go, go!

455
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:18,584
LAPD!

456
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:19,688
Hands in the air!

457
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,141
I don't want any heroes!

458
00:18:21,144 --> 00:18:22,403
Hands up!

459
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:26,576
Lucifer. Come here!

460
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,696
What the hell, man? SWAT?

461
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:31,185
Yes, well, this is when
I normally get into a spot

462
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:33,169
of danger, so I called in for backup

463
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:34,703
like a responsible detective would.

464
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:36,238
The suspect was just about to give me

465
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,724
incriminating evidence, man.

466
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:41,678
Daniel, would you quit
making this about yourself.

467
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:53,656
- Looking for booze?
- Yeah.

468
00:18:53,658 --> 00:18:56,592
And Maze's bong, and decent music,

469
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,795
and a strapping naked dude
with student loans and a dream.

470
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:01,397
Not on Maze's itinerary.

471
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,098
- Maze has an itinerary?
- Yep.

472
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,165
And I stole it.

473
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:07,060
Nail art,

474
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,227
Mahjong,

475
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,109
silent meditation?

476
00:19:10,112 --> 00:19:12,045
Did you guys find the booze?

477
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:14,910
Exactly. We should be
nipple-deep in Jager by now

478
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:16,896
and playing pin the
tail on Ryan Gosling.

479
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:20,795
I can't believe that Maze legit
hijacked my bachelorette party.

480
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,318
- You mean Chloe's bachelorette party.
- That's what I said.

481
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:27,089
This is odd. What is Maze up to?

482
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:30,029
Okay. All the things that
you love about Pierce. Go.

483
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:33,357
Oh. He does this really
adorable, like, scrape-y thing

484
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,021
- when he burns the toast...
- Aw.

485
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,647
And do-do I really have
to do a hundred of these?

486
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:40,703
- Yes.
- Oh, man. I promised Chloe the moon.

487
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:43,539
And I gave her burnt toast.

488
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,747
Please. We've got to do something.

489
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,943
Yeah.

490
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:49,746
I've got an idea.

491
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,216
I'm not gonna bite you, Pierce.

492
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:56,619
Says the guy who's tried
to kill me numerous times...

493
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:58,122
and now can succeed.

494
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,672
Relax. I asked you here to celebrate.

495
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:06,795
So you're not mad that
I got rid of my mark?

496
00:20:06,797 --> 00:20:09,489
I feel this odd kinship, actually.

497
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:12,000
I mean, this is like the,
uh, the first official meeting

498
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,837
of the Immortals Turned Mortal Club.

499
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,000
In that case, the beer's on you.

500
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:19,741
It's all my Father's
plan, I have to assume.

501
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:20,709
Maybe.

502
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:22,289
But for now, I need to keep it quiet

503
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:23,458
from certain people,

504
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:25,028
until I know it's gonna stick.

505
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:28,984
First club rule: cone of silencio.

506
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:31,620
I've wanted this to happen for so long.

507
00:20:31,622 --> 00:20:33,146
It's hard to believe it actually is.

508
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,247
Hey, I'm really happy
for you, Pierce. Truly.

509
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,469
- Thanks, bro.
- I mean,

510
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:39,528
becoming mortal is the best
thing that ever happened to me.

511
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,499
Everything is so much better
when you know that you can...

512
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:46,578
you can die at any moment.

513
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:48,969
How much time do we
have left? 30-odd years?

514
00:20:48,972 --> 00:20:51,072
40, if we lay off the sauce?

515
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:52,541
I mean, that's a drop in the bucket

516
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,195
for a former immortal.

517
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:55,606
Hadn't thought of it that way.

518
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:59,271
Every sip of beer, every blue sky,

519
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:01,417
every motorcycle ride,

520
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,560
every kiss...

521
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:06,221
So much more precious

522
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,411
when you realize it could be your last.

523
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:12,310
That any random act could just...

524
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,798
take it all away.

525
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:20,169
Uh.

526
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:21,570
Oh, come on.

527
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:26,308
Definitely strapless. Mmm.

528
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,843
And with a bow.

529
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:29,849
Yes. Yes. A big one.

530
00:21:29,852 --> 00:21:31,591
Okay, I'm gonna get another roll.

531
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:34,316
I did this two-ply

532
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:35,317
wedding dress garbage

533
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,989
at my cousin Rita's bachelorette party.

534
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:40,036
You know what happened?
Not drunken pole dancing.

535
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,690
You know what else isn't happening?

536
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:43,492
Us. Here.

537
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:45,513
This is torture.

538
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:46,949
Of course, Maze.

539
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,084
This all makes sense.

540
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:54,458
Oh, my gosh, what could that be?

541
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:57,435
It's probably just, uh, Trixie
and her stupid little friend

542
00:21:57,438 --> 00:21:59,541
- next door.
- Hold on.

543
00:21:59,544 --> 00:22:00,805
Chloe.

544
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:06,882
Is that...? You see it?

545
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,013
Oh, my God.

546
00:22:11,016 --> 00:22:13,919
Okay, now, this is what I'm
talking about right here.

547
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:17,993
You didn't really think
we'd stay home, did you?

548
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:20,419
- You guys, you shouldn't have.
- Honk, honk.

549
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,849
Honk for "Fun! Fun! Fun!"

550
00:22:21,852 --> 00:22:26,164
No, they really shouldn't have.

551
00:22:29,918 --> 00:22:32,097
The detective always goes first.

552
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,600
So, Vince.

553
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:38,237
Let me guess: you were hired

554
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:41,548
to take out Francis so Cornelia
couldn't compete in the show.

555
00:22:41,551 --> 00:22:42,939
Or was the dog the target,

556
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:45,571
and she attacked, so you
killed the owner instead?

557
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:46,712
Hmm?

558
00:22:46,714 --> 00:22:49,115
This is where I'd make a
clever pun about the underdog.

559
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,276
Look, I wasn't hired to take out

560
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:52,051
the competition, I am the competition.

561
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:54,053
- What do you mean?
- I got into dog training through

562
00:22:54,055 --> 00:22:56,422
the "pups and parolees" program in jail.

563
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:58,203
That's how I got this bite.

564
00:22:58,206 --> 00:22:59,640
I fell in love with one.

565
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:01,015
Elliot.

566
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:03,109
I found out later he
was a purebred Mastiff,

567
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,174
so I started taking
him to all the shows.

568
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,598
He loves the shows.

569
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:08,134
You're not in the competition database.

570
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,836
Daniel, that's my line.

571
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,682
You're not in the competition database.

572
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:14,967
If those snobs ever saw me with my Elly,

573
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,500
they'd never give him a fair shake.

574
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:18,577
So I pay someone to
pretend to be his owner.

575
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,911
Then why were you fighting with Francis?

576
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:21,293
Look, I don't want to
talk about it, all right?

577
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:22,761
Daniel, time to slam the suspect

578
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:24,450
up against the wall
to elicit a response.

579
00:23:24,452 --> 00:23:26,352
- Wait...
- Oh, come on, practice with me.

580
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:27,520
Look, look, look.

581
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,588
The fight with Francis
was over puppy custody.

582
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:32,391
Cornelia was pregnant.

583
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:33,940
With my Elly's babies.

584
00:23:33,943 --> 00:23:35,323
I could never murder the puppies'

585
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,595
maternal grandfather.

586
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:38,198
I'm not some monster.

587
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:40,933
A litter of purebred Mastiff puppies

588
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:42,968
is worth tens of thousands of dollars.

589
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,670
O-Oh, right.

590
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:46,438
Who else knew about the puppies?

591
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:53,964
Oh, The Big Easy!

592
00:24:08,095 --> 00:24:09,929
Put them on, put them on.

593
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:12,652
Okay, okay. Look. "L'il
Miss Can't Behave."

594
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:13,863
Oh, my gosh.

595
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:15,801
- Oh!
- Gosh. Oh, my gosh.

596
00:24:15,803 --> 00:24:17,503
- Oh! Oh!
- Maze.

597
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:19,705
Oh, don't worry, Decker, there's
lots more where that came from.

598
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:20,972
- Really?
- There really is.

599
00:24:20,975 --> 00:24:23,842
Did you see that bar?

600
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:24,945
Is it cool?

601
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:26,879
What the hell is this?

602
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:29,605
Uh, the best bachelorette party ever.

603
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:32,651
Hells yeah. This bus really
amped things up a notch!

604
00:24:32,653 --> 00:24:34,920
Yeah, and now I need you to de-notch.

605
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:38,023
Are you nuts? This is
everything I ever dreamed of.

606
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:40,160
In genuine pleather.

607
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:43,792
Ella, I really need
this wedding to happen.

608
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:47,246
That means no surprises, no problems,

609
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,863
and definitely no
drunken change of heart.

610
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:52,304
We all know Decker
can't handle her booze.

611
00:24:52,306 --> 00:24:55,800
I don't know. She seems to
be handling it just fine.

612
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:57,910
Yeah! Looks like marrying

613
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,136
ol' reliable is letting her
bust out her inner Lucifer.

614
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:05,355
Yeah? And we all know he
isn't the marrying kind.

615
00:25:05,358 --> 00:25:07,806
Come on, Maze, it's one night.

616
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,667
Just let her have some fun.

617
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,190
What could possibly go wrong?

618
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:18,731
No!

619
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:25,081
Charlotte, what is happening?

620
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:27,011
I agreed to waive the charges

621
00:25:27,014 --> 00:25:29,027
on the Malibu State water polo team

622
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,077
if they agreed to
wave some other things.

623
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,147
- Amazing.
- Right?

624
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:37,149
Yeah!

625
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:46,589
The Barkley. Owned
by Dr. Valerie Haynes,

626
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:49,356
veterinarian to the stars
and the SoCal Dog Show.

627
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:51,225
Apparently, every canine
contestant is required

628
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:52,494
to be examined by Dr. Valerie

629
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:54,631
before they can actually
compete, which means...

630
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:56,769
She definitely would have
known Cornelia was pregnant.

631
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,470
And she would have
been at the crime scene.

632
00:25:58,472 --> 00:26:00,116
No, I still don't think this is working.

633
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,170
Agree.

634
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:03,040
- And I think it's my fault.
- Also agree.

635
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:05,644
See, the problem is, we rarely
work this closely together,

636
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:08,246
you and I. And you can't
be expected to just know

637
00:26:08,248 --> 00:26:10,639
the delicate
detective-consultant chemistry.

638
00:26:10,642 --> 00:26:12,583
So I think you clearly need

639
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:15,353
an intensive hands-on
tutelage on how to be me.

640
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:17,342
- That, I don't agree with.
- Excellent.

641
00:26:17,345 --> 00:26:18,886
Uh, you might want to take some notes.

642
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:20,358
- Oh, yeah.
- Hello there.

643
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,227
Uh, we would love to see Dr. Valerie,

644
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:24,229
if possible.

645
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:26,098
I can assure you

646
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,766
I know nothing about any murder.

647
00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:30,502
Over puppies? I mean,
who would do such a thing?

648
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:32,504
Well, the rent in this part
of town is pretty hefty.

649
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:34,206
And those puppies were
extremely valuable,

650
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:35,640
especially on the black market.

651
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:37,509
Oh.

652
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:39,711
You think I need money?

653
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:42,481
Imagine how much people
spend on their kids.

654
00:26:42,483 --> 00:26:45,069
Peanuts compared to what
they spend on their pets.

655
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:46,238
Trust me,

656
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:48,253
I have more than I could ever want.

657
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:50,154
Oh. Do you, now?

658
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:51,423
Watch and learn.

659
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:55,261
Surely, there must be
something that you desire.

660
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:57,796
I...

661
00:26:57,798 --> 00:26:59,531
Mm.

662
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:00,766
I'm...

663
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:02,568
Mm-hmm.

664
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:06,071
I'm really all good.

665
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:07,205
Come now,

666
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:11,077
there's really nothing
you want deep, deep down?

667
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:17,215
I want the miracle of birth.

668
00:27:17,217 --> 00:27:19,506
Trying to solve a murder
here, love, but I'm sure

669
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,519
you can find someone
to help you with that.

670
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:22,819
Eventually.

671
00:27:22,822 --> 00:27:24,688
You don't mean...

672
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:26,192
for you, do you?

673
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,434
Of course I took the dog
when I had the chance.

674
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:38,670
Do you know how little I get paid?

675
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,038
All the missed holidays?

676
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,674
Dr. Valerie spends most
of her time in Hawaii.

677
00:27:42,676 --> 00:27:43,909
So I took Cornelia

678
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:45,043
and I hid her here.

679
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:46,912
And when Francis tried to stop you,

680
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:48,180
you, what, killed him?

681
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:50,667
No! I was backstage,

682
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,917
but he was already dead.

683
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,428
Cornelia was frantic.

684
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:54,430
She came to me.

685
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:55,986
She's very particular,

686
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:57,656
and she knew that I
would take care of her.

687
00:27:57,658 --> 00:27:59,224
By selling her precious babies?

688
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:00,826
I know it was wrong,

689
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:03,929
but I was gonna return her
right after she gave birth.

690
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:07,032
Look, I'm not a killer. I swear.

691
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:09,100
They never are, are they?

692
00:28:09,102 --> 00:28:11,102
Well, given motive and lack of alibi,

693
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:12,838
you leave me with no
choice but to follow

694
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
my trusty detective gut and arrest you

695
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:16,675
for the murder of Francis Hoffman.

696
00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:17,809
Tag her and bag her.

697
00:28:18,912 --> 00:28:21,813
Well, suspect apprehended.

698
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:22,811
Canine found.

699
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:25,170
And that is how it's done, Daniel.

700
00:28:35,495 --> 00:28:36,988
Oh, my gosh.

701
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:39,264
That's definitely one way to sober up.

702
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:42,634
Charlotte. Oh, Charlotte, hi.

703
00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:43,668
Gettin' your groove on?

704
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:46,785
My groove is on pause lately.

705
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:48,807
But forget about me.

706
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:51,042
This night is all you.

707
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:52,744
I got to say, it's nice forgetting

708
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:54,613
about the wedding stress for once.

709
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:55,647
Why stress?

710
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:57,382
It's all exciting!

711
00:28:57,384 --> 00:28:59,647
And so bold.

712
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,783
First Dan, now Pierce?

713
00:29:01,786 --> 00:29:04,050
Marrying a second guy from your office?

714
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:06,256
But screw the
professional optics, right?

715
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:07,386
You have a type.

716
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:09,060
When you know, you know.

717
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:10,566
Whoa! What are you doing? Whoa!

718
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:12,589
Um, is it just me

719
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:16,835
or are we short a couple
of giant hot dudes?

720
00:29:17,938 --> 00:29:19,679
Maze! What are you doing?

721
00:29:19,682 --> 00:29:20,714
Hey!

722
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,240
I liked that guy!

723
00:29:22,242 --> 00:29:24,175
He smelled like chlorine

724
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:25,988
and butterscotch fudge.

725
00:29:27,214 --> 00:29:31,650
I am five-feet-nothing
of coiled live wire, Maze.

726
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:34,277
This... means... war!

727
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,152
Linda, Linda, Linda, Linda, please!

728
00:29:36,155 --> 00:29:38,823
Maybe we can circle back
and-and then pick him up again.

729
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:40,258
While we're on the topic,

730
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,128
I would love some relationship advice.

731
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,964
From me? Well, I'm
not an expert. Clearly.

732
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,232
I don't know.

733
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:49,467
I mean, your faith in some

734
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:52,771
pretty ruinous odds is truly inspiring.

735
00:29:52,773 --> 00:29:53,897
Did you know

736
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,806
that L.A. has one of
the highest divorce rates

737
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:57,809
- in all of the U.S.?
- Does it?

738
00:29:57,811 --> 00:29:59,344
- Yeah.
- Really?

739
00:29:59,346 --> 00:30:02,147
My plan has nothing to do with you.

740
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:03,558
It is for Chloe.

741
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:06,418
I want to get her
exactly what she wants.

742
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,485
Pierce.

743
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:09,095
Married. To her.

744
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,230
No drama.

745
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:12,214
Yeah. Totally agree!

746
00:30:12,217 --> 00:30:14,526
Total lack of drama

747
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,394
starting right now!

748
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,630
Cupid Maze? Altruism?

749
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:20,308
Pearls? No way.

750
00:30:20,311 --> 00:30:21,866
People get married now multiple times.

751
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:23,034
You're up to something!

752
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:24,302
- I mean...
- Tell me!

753
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:26,071
I suppose there's nothing stopping you

754
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:27,238
from getting married again

755
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,440
- after Pierce.
- Charlotte,

756
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:31,205
I know you're not trying
to freak Chloe out,

757
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,441
but it kind of seems

758
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:33,812
like you're getting in her head.

759
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:35,652
- You really think so?
- Wait,

760
00:30:35,655 --> 00:30:38,450
are you trying to freak
her out on purpose?

761
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:39,718
Uh...

762
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,311
Let's go.

763
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:42,621
Bring it.

764
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:46,558
Stop the freaking bus!

765
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:52,589
Everyone but Chloe out!

766
00:30:52,592 --> 00:30:55,379
Now!

767
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:01,148
You know,

768
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,854
we could've sent the dog back
with the rest of the guys.

769
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:06,588
Nonsense. The detective would
never allow a pregnant lady

770
00:31:06,591 --> 00:31:08,923
to ride in the back
of a filthy police van.

771
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:10,391
How very sensitive of her.

772
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:12,193
Yes. And so predictable.

773
00:31:12,195 --> 00:31:15,863
I mean, how can the detective's
actions be so easy to replicate

774
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:17,832
and yet so hard to decipher?

775
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,400
I still have absolutely no clue

776
00:31:19,402 --> 00:31:21,769
as to why she said yes to Pierce.

777
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:24,038
Not to point fingers, Daniel,

778
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,174
but I do wish you'd tried
harder to be, well, me.

779
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,410
If you weren't so afraid
all the bloody time...

780
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:31,385
I am not afraid.

781
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:33,180
Oh. Oh, really?

782
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,583
You say you're giving
Charlotte time and space

783
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:37,117
because it's what she wants,

784
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,286
but we both know you're
using it as an excuse

785
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:41,622
- to avoid telling her what you want.
- Fine.

786
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:43,209
Okay. Yeah. Maybe...

787
00:31:43,212 --> 00:31:45,479
maybe I'm not great at
admitting what I want.

788
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,261
And maybe it wouldn't kill me to...

789
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:49,849
- Lucifer it up every now and then.
- Mm.

790
00:31:49,852 --> 00:31:51,565
But when it comes to
understanding people,

791
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:54,401
I'm not taking any
pointers from you, man.

792
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:57,819
In fact, I think you're
the one who's afraid.

793
00:31:57,822 --> 00:31:59,221
Excuse me?

794
00:31:59,224 --> 00:32:01,987
The reason you won't ask
Chloe why she's marrying Pierce

795
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,644
is because you're scared
to hear the answer.

796
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:05,783
- That's absurd.
- No.

797
00:32:05,786 --> 00:32:09,282
That's why you're playing all
these stupid little head games.

798
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:11,518
Which aren't gonna work, by the way.

799
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,554
Because, first off,

800
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,723
you're only thinking
about Chloe as her job.

801
00:32:16,725 --> 00:32:18,692
I mean, you don't even
call her by her name.

802
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:20,755
Which is Chloe, not "the detective."

803
00:32:20,758 --> 00:32:21,923
It's endearing.

804
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:23,159
Oh, come on.

805
00:32:23,162 --> 00:32:24,755
You believe this guy, Cornelia?

806
00:32:25,668 --> 00:32:26,833
Chloe is so much more

807
00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:28,101
than work, man.

808
00:32:28,103 --> 00:32:29,336
She's a friend.

809
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,371
She's a devoted parent to Trixie.

810
00:32:31,373 --> 00:32:33,950
- She's the most amazing human being I've...
- Daniel.

811
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,354
You ignorant, fearful
genius... you're right.

812
00:32:36,357 --> 00:32:37,444
Really?

813
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:38,779
Indeed. To truly understand

814
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:40,881
the detective's motivations,
I need to experience

815
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:42,482
the full spectrum of her life.

816
00:32:42,484 --> 00:32:44,384
- Okay.
- So what I need is a defenseless,

817
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:46,520
barely verbal creature
who depends entirely on me

818
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:48,638
- for her every need.
- What are you talking about?

819
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:51,476
I need a Trixie. I...

820
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,679
Hello.

821
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:57,418
- Uh, ew.
- Maze,

822
00:32:57,421 --> 00:33:00,345
what part of co-hosting a bachelorette
party did you not understand?

823
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:02,869
Hey, nobody asked me about any damn bus!

824
00:33:02,872 --> 00:33:05,371
Yeah, so you throw my next best chance

825
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:07,107
for a sex life off it?

826
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:10,010
- And, you, why are you freaking Chloe out?
- Yeah, I should never

827
00:33:10,012 --> 00:33:10,943
have invited her.

828
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:12,437
I was trying to help!

829
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,479
You know, a little prenuptial
conflict is healthy.

830
00:33:15,482 --> 00:33:17,145
It's better to get it out of the system.

831
00:33:17,148 --> 00:33:18,553
Oh, you want conflict?

832
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:20,786
Done! Okay, ladies, please.

833
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:23,123
- There's still time to fix this, okay?
- Come on, Maze.

834
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,545
Two words: matching tattoos.

835
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:27,147
What?

836
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,629
Fake tattoos. Fake.

837
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,064
Pierce tipped me off...

838
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:33,867
- Pierce was looking into fake tattoos?
- Yeah. I mean,

839
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:34,795
he made me promise

840
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,236
not to tell anyone... But you know what?

841
00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:37,623
Lying bastard!

842
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:39,727
Where is Maze going?

843
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,608
Bigger problem, girls.

844
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:44,612
Where'd Chloe go?

845
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:46,936
Oh...

846
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:51,184
No, sit, child.

847
00:33:51,186 --> 00:33:53,220
Oh, goodness me. Sitzen.

848
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:54,755
Oh, my goodness.

849
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:55,922
This is ridiculous.

850
00:33:55,924 --> 00:33:57,925
I mean, at least the
detective's human dependent

851
00:33:57,928 --> 00:33:59,793
can be bribed with chocolate and cash.

852
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:02,329
But apparently, chocolate's
toxic for Ms. Picky here.

853
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,664
And she ate my wallet.

854
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,799
- What is that smell? And why is there...
- Hmm?

855
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:08,702
- Crime scene tape all around my desk?
- Because trust me, Daniel,

856
00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:11,571
Cornelia committed a very
serious infraction over there.

857
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:12,839
Children are

858
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:14,741
so needy... I mean,
you wouldn't understand,

859
00:34:14,743 --> 00:34:17,120
but being a single parent is exhausting.

860
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:19,029
Dude, it's been an hour.

861
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:20,948
Well, in dog years, that's an eternity.

862
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:23,906
Yeah, well, your parenting
days are over, okay?

863
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,809
Francis's husband Frederick is here.

864
00:34:25,812 --> 00:34:28,401
Frederick! Oh. Good to see you again.

865
00:34:28,404 --> 00:34:30,123
What a pity. We were just bonding.

866
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,347
Thank you, Detectives.

867
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,253
I had no idea she was pregnant.

868
00:34:33,256 --> 00:34:35,667
Now I can start to rebuild
our family. Well, if you just,

869
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:39,299
uh, sign the release form,

870
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:41,769
and she's all yours.

871
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,841
There's my good girl.

872
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:49,710
Ah...

873
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,245
Girl...

874
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:53,480
Oh, poor baby.

875
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:55,716
She's clearly feeling the strain.

876
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,779
Cornelia?

877
00:34:57,782 --> 00:34:58,884
Come.

878
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,153
Bye, child.

879
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:01,955
I'll really...

880
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:03,725
Good-bye.

881
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:07,662
Right, now, that's...

882
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:10,506
Where's he gone?

883
00:35:14,703 --> 00:35:16,804
How you doing there, hon?

884
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:20,073
C... Can you see me?

885
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:22,709
I see a lot of things on this bus.

886
00:35:22,711 --> 00:35:25,011
Looks like something's eating at you.

887
00:35:26,982 --> 00:35:30,083
Well, it just...

888
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:34,287
it all happened so fast, and...

889
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:37,224
everyone's wondering
why I said yes, and...

890
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:40,060
I-I'm wondering the same thing myself.

891
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:42,120
I don't know, m-maybe I thought

892
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:43,830
that marrying a...

893
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:47,501
a safe, steady guy would...

894
00:35:47,503 --> 00:35:51,331
somehow... change me
into a different person,

895
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:55,182
and that-that maybe
this new, spontaneous me

896
00:35:55,185 --> 00:35:57,477
would-would somehow...

897
00:35:57,479 --> 00:36:01,548
inspire the... the
person that I still am.

898
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:06,346
Hey, are you married?

899
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:07,988
17 years.

900
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,990
He's my everything.

901
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:13,127
Hopefully, your guy is, too.

902
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:21,068
How does she even do this?

903
00:36:24,456 --> 00:36:26,088
Well, that's odd.

904
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:29,476
Cornelia's prenatal examination
was signed by Frederick,

905
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:33,346
but he said he didn't
know about the pregnancy.

906
00:36:33,348 --> 00:36:36,316
And the signature's a match.

907
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:38,685
Which means he lied.

908
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:40,821
Ergo...

909
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,256
he's most likely the killer.

910
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:45,593
Well done, Detective!

911
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:49,796
Well...

912
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:52,499
well done, Detective.

913
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,702
Get in here, you stupid mutt.

914
00:36:55,704 --> 00:36:58,271
Come on!

915
00:36:58,273 --> 00:37:01,641
- Is that how you treat a pregnant lady?
- What the...?

916
00:37:01,643 --> 00:37:04,248
- How did you get in here?
- I had a hunch you were the killer.

917
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:07,646
When your "fur baby" wouldn't go to you.

918
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:11,284
Cornelia only goes...

919
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:13,887
to people she trusts.

920
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:16,022
Not killers.

921
00:37:16,024 --> 00:37:19,768
Only question now is: why, Frederick?

922
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:23,088
I'm more than happy to
discuss this with you

923
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:24,533
after I tend to Cornelia.

924
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,117
Listen.

925
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,719
You got to understand,

926
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,498
a dog is supposed to
be man's best friend,

927
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:41,496
not man's best replacement.

928
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:43,432
Do you know what it's like

929
00:37:43,434 --> 00:37:46,869
to be kicked out of
your own bed by a dog?!

930
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:49,705
But... I could never get up the nerve

931
00:37:49,707 --> 00:37:51,576
to just tell Francis what I wanted.

932
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:53,379
You were scared of what
the answer could be.

933
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:56,216
Then I found out about the puppies.

934
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:59,587
Six more reasons for him to neglect me.

935
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,357
And we fought...

936
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,860
and he fell,

937
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,029
and he hit his head.

938
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,435
It was an accident.

939
00:38:05,438 --> 00:38:07,671
Why don't you just put the gun down.

940
00:38:07,674 --> 00:38:09,241
Come back to the station

941
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:11,099
and tell your side of the story.

942
00:38:11,102 --> 00:38:13,002
I should've just shot the dog!

943
00:38:13,005 --> 00:38:15,313
But it's so hard to kill a creature

944
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:17,551
with such intelligence in its eyes.

945
00:38:21,186 --> 00:38:22,594
LAPD!

946
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:26,476
Wha...?

947
00:38:27,187 --> 00:38:29,391
Ah. There you are.

948
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:31,008
Typical.

949
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:33,225
You leave me with the
paperwork and run off alone.

950
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,437
No thought of danger,
no thought of protocol...

951
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,120
You really... don't
see the irony, do you?

952
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:41,891
All I see, Daniel, is that I
can't rely on you as my partner.

953
00:38:41,894 --> 00:38:45,055
So perhaps I should find someone
steady, someone responsible,

954
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:47,937
someone who can
actually be there for me.

955
00:38:54,372 --> 00:38:56,695
Oh.

956
00:38:56,808 --> 00:38:58,941
Oh.

957
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:00,744
I get it now.

958
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:07,937
So you thought I wouldn't
find out your mark is fake.

959
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,648
You know, for a guy who's
lived for a million years,

960
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:12,017
you're a real dumbass.

961
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,488
Shh.

962
00:39:13,491 --> 00:39:15,055
She's asleep.

963
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,308
Can't use the kid as a
human shield forever, Cain.

964
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:26,859
Maybe not tonight...

965
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:31,107
but I am coming for you.

966
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:40,859
Hey. You're here.

967
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:42,884
Why isn't Trixie at her sleepover?

968
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:45,661
I stopped by to check on her,
and she wanted to come home.

969
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,332
Um...

970
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:50,598
about all this wedding stuff...

971
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:51,900
It's way too overwhelming.

972
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:54,138
- Yeah, I agree. It's, uh, it's-it's...
- Yeah.

973
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,770
Listen, let's forget

974
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:58,223
about the whole "big event"
thing, okay? Life is too short.

975
00:39:58,226 --> 00:39:59,794
- Too short, yeah.
- Yeah.

976
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:00,872
Let's elope.

977
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,520
We don't need the whole circus.

978
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:04,489
It's about you and me.

979
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:06,593
Yeah.

980
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:08,863
And-and-and that's why I...

981
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,020
I can't marry you.

982
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:18,987
I'm sorry, Marcus.

983
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:29,166
Dan.

984
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,762
Are you okay?

985
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:34,799
Uh...

986
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:36,735
I don't know.

987
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:39,137
Got a lot of things on my mind.

988
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,074
Could be kind of serious.

989
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:43,043
Tell me about it.

990
00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:44,848
I am... whew...

991
00:40:44,851 --> 00:40:47,192
Seriously wondering why I said yes

992
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,513
to that fifth shot of tequila.

993
00:40:55,283 --> 00:40:56,333
What is it?

994
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,692
Charlotte, I know that, um...

995
00:40:59,695 --> 00:41:01,695
we've been keeping things kind of loose,

996
00:41:01,698 --> 00:41:04,989
and I said that you
could use your space.

997
00:41:04,992 --> 00:41:07,126
And if that's what you want...

998
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:10,794
if that's what you truly
want, then I respect that.

999
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:16,919
But... I never told you what I want.

1000
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:21,468
I want you.

1001
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:24,634
All in.

1002
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:26,104
The whole deal.

1003
00:41:29,993 --> 00:41:32,627
So, um...

1004
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,631
so there.

1005
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,688
Okay.

1006
00:41:40,691 --> 00:41:42,224
Really?

1007
00:42:01,029 --> 00:42:02,903
Ah. Detective.

1008
00:42:02,906 --> 00:42:04,356
Good. You're back.

1009
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:06,473
I am. Yeah.

1010
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:08,229
Excellent, because...

1011
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:10,426
well, there's a few
things I need to say.

1012
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:13,029
- Hmm.
- You see, I've, um...

1013
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,198
well, I...

1014
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:18,473
I've actually learned
something for once.

1015
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:21,179
Oh.

1016
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:22,816
No ring.

1017
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,505
Yep, no ring.

1018
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:30,273
Oh.

1019
00:42:30,276 --> 00:42:32,864
So, you were saying
you learned something?

1020
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:35,278
Oh. Oh, it's nothing.

1021
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:37,982
Nothing. Completely irrelevant.

1022
00:42:37,985 --> 00:42:39,918
Right.

1023
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:41,220
Well...

1024
00:42:41,223 --> 00:42:43,291
a new case just dropped, so...

1025
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,227
I was thinking... Back to work?

1026
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,632
Back to work.

1027
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,703
- After you.
- Thank you.

1028
00:42:55,547 --> 00:42:57,580
- Shall we take my car?
- Yes.
