1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,638
- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- Uriel didn't just die.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,733
<i>I killed him.</i>

3
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:08,275
Where's Uriel?

4
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:09,576
Oh.

5
00:00:09,578 --> 00:00:11,835
You look really familiar. Have we met?

6
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:14,550
35 years ago, Father
asked me to come down here

7
00:00:14,552 --> 00:00:16,583
<i>to bless a couple who was
unable to have a child.</i>

8
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:18,352
MOM: <i>God put her in Lucifer's path.</i>

9
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:19,653
Why are you so upset?

10
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:21,903
Because I just don't know if it's real.

11
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:24,058
<i>Why is it that sometimes I'm immortal,</i>

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,475
<i>and other times I'm all too human?</i>

13
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:28,202
<i>Appears you make me vulnerable.</i>

14
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:30,831
What's in that package is
far more valuable than drugs.

15
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,232
LUCIFER: <i>You're a bad man.</i>

16
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,435
DAN: <i>Dr. Jason Carlisle.
He saved the dissertation</i>

17
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:36,970
<i>while an innocent college student died.</i>

18
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:39,473
(shouts)

19
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:40,813
Freeze!

20
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:43,350
ELLA: <i>We are talking
designer poison, here.</i>

21
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:44,611
So, how do we get an antidote?

22
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:46,365
Well, that right there
is the tricky part.

23
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:48,724
<i>Designer poisons need
designer antidotes.</i>

24
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:49,892
LUCIFER: Detective!

25
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:54,040
It won't stop.

26
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:03,897
(tires screech)

27
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,266
CHLOE: <i>Lucifer.</i>

28
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:09,036
The bleeding stopped. You don't
have to drive like a maniac.

29
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:10,738
You've forgotten you've
been poisoned, Detective,

30
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,072
or has it already reached your brain?

31
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:14,508
Maybe it's just a
nosebleed. I mean, I-I...

32
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,590
How could the professor
have injected me?

33
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:18,145
I didn't get one of his flu shots.

34
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:19,413
What about when you went after him?

35
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:20,914
Well, I don't know.

36
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:24,551
I tackled him to the ground,
we-we struggled for a bit,

37
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:27,154
and, God, I guess if
he injected me somehow,

38
00:01:27,156 --> 00:01:29,223
it would have to be just...

39
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:32,160
- Ugh.
- Oh, God.

40
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:34,428
Everything's gonna be fine
once we get to the hospital.

41
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,463
Okay?

42
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:39,500
We can't go to the hospital.

43
00:01:39,502 --> 00:01:41,735
- What?
- Lucifer, going to the hospital

44
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:44,438
didn't help any of the other victims.

45
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,007
The only thing that's gonna save my life

46
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,509
is finding the antidote.

47
00:01:49,606 --> 00:01:52,279
Otherwise, I'm...

48
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:55,449
All right. All right, very well.

49
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:57,451
(tires screech)

50
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,526
No judgments, guys, okay?

51
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:08,196
You said come right away,
so I came right away.

52
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:10,531
You're lucky I remembered
to put on pants...

53
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,432
eventually. So, what's up?

54
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:14,368
- Well, um...
- Well, we're worried

55
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,237
that someone else, um, out
there might be poisoned.

56
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,539
Oh, I doubt it.

57
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,874
I asked every hospital in
the area to report anything

58
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:23,076
even resembling a poisoning.

59
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:24,378
So far, haven't heard a peep.

60
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,247
Well, just to be sure,
let's, uh, let's go over

61
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:29,049
what you found at the
professor's lab, okay?

62
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:30,417
Check it out.

63
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,485
(whispering): Uh, Detective.

64
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:33,066
We should tell her.

65
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:34,657
(whispering): No, we can't.

66
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:36,990
She'll freak out. It'll get in
the way of the investigation.

67
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:38,425
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

68
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:40,227
ELLA: Are you guys done
having your whisper fight?

69
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,331
Uh, just make out already
and get it over with. Yeesh.

70
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,500
So... I did find

71
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:48,202
this syringe on the scene.

72
00:02:48,204 --> 00:02:51,839
It had a tiny bit of poison
left in it, so, yeah, in theory,

73
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:53,207
someone out there may have been dosed.

74
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:55,742
- Hmm.
- Okay, but the other poisons

75
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:57,665
had corresponding antidotes, yeah?

76
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,613
Did you find anything
to match this one?

77
00:02:59,615 --> 00:03:01,014
I did.

78
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:06,053
Problem is, dude destroyed
whatever was inside.

79
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:08,388
Dick move, right?

80
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,224
I mean, that's why I'm glad no
one's reported to any hospitals,

81
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:11,491
'cause without the antidote,

82
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:14,027
ugh, they'd end up just
like the other victims.

83
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:16,930
You know, first a bloody nose and then

84
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:19,733
- fainting spells, followed by seizures...
- We get the point.

85
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:22,436
...and then their guts
slowly start boiling,

86
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:23,837
like, literally boiling.

87
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:26,006
It's so gross and nasty,
and 24 hours later...

88
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,675
- bam, just like that, dead as a doornail.
- Got it. Thank you. Yes.

89
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:30,410
- You've painting quite the picture,
Miss Lopez. - CHLOE: Right.

90
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:32,646
Yeah, let's go over everything else

91
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:34,724
- from the professor's lab. Okay?
- LUCIFER: Mm.

92
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:36,283
Just to see if we've missed anything.

93
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:37,885
Okay? Sure.

94
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:42,055
Okay. So...

95
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:43,123
Here we go.

96
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:48,762
I got your text. What's so urgent?

97
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:50,998
Uh... this way.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,399
Somewhere we can speak in private.

99
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,786
(grunts)

100
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:04,678
Was this part of Father's plan?

101
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,913
Hmm?

102
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:06,914
Answer me, brother,

103
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,115
before I rip your spine out

104
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,317
- and beat you to death with it.
- What are you talking about?

105
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,953
How long...

106
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:14,955
how long have you been manipulating me?

107
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:16,523
Mom told you about Chloe?

108
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:17,925
Oh, that she did.

109
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:20,928
And that you put the
detective in my path.

110
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,696
No, I didn't.

111
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:24,731
Father did.

112
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:28,302
I was just another pawn in His game.

113
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:29,636
I had no idea.

114
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:31,238
And the detective?

115
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,076
Is she simply another
pawn as well or is she...

116
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:37,110
Is she?

117
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:39,346
She doesn't know anything.

118
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,457
Listen.

119
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:53,327
Luci, we've been played like puppets.

120
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:56,229
Father has manipulated us both.

121
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:59,066
Don't you dare compare our situations.

122
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:04,538
All that I have ever wanted
to do for all of my existence

123
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,939
was make Father proud.

124
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:10,343
I thought I was doing
great works in His name.

125
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:13,113
Instead, the very first of His angels

126
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:15,749
was busy making you a little girlfriend.

127
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:19,152
Oh. Well, my heart bleeds for you.

128
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:21,050
We're on the same side here, brother.

129
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:22,141
Are we?

130
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:26,259
Then be honest with me, brother.

131
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:28,528
How deep does Father's plan go?

132
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,531
Is the detective's poisoning part of it?

133
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,568
Poisoning?

134
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,203
I don't know what you're talking about.

135
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:38,305
You really don't know?

136
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:39,840
No.

137
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:42,009
Then you...

138
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,046
...you can't help her.

139
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:50,083

00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:51,985

142
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,624
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

143
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:59,359
Amenadiel.

144
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,794
Give us a minute.

145
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:03,630
I... have an idea.
I need to talk to you.

146
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,569
Okay, so the professor's
been using this Burt guy

147
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:11,371
(whispering): to smuggle in the poisons.

148
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:12,506
What, so you think that Burt

149
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,193
might have smuggled
the antidotes as well?

150
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:15,675
- Yes.
- All right.

151
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:16,843
Point me to his prison cell.

152
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:19,179
Perhaps some toilet
wine waterboarding or...

153
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:20,514
(whispering): Well,
he's already out on bail,

154
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:22,482
but the good news is, he
does have an ankle bracelet

155
00:06:22,484 --> 00:06:24,484
so he can't get far.

00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:28,748
So, why don't you show me the bedroom?

180
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,984
You read my mind.

181
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:33,520
So...

182
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:35,622
oh.

183
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:37,124
Uh.

184
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:38,692
Y-You okay?

185
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:42,629
Oh... um...

186
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:44,030
Yeah, yeah.

187
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:45,765
No, no, I'm fine.

188
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:47,312
I'm fine. What were you saying?

189
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:50,547
Uh... yeah. Yeah, maybe another time.

190
00:07:50,572 --> 00:07:53,573
No, that doesn't really work for me.

191
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:55,575
(chuckles)

192
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:56,643
(grunts)

193
00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:58,345
(groans)

194
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,037
(groans)

195
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:08,881
Hey, what the hell is this?

196
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,372
Hello, Burtrude.

197
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,000
Remember me?

198
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:24,404
(Burt screams)

199
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:26,439
You didn't hurt him, did you?

200
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,375
Physically, no, as I promised.

201
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:30,343
- Too bad.
- I did get him to talk,

202
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:32,512
but he didn't smuggle the antidote.

203
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:33,847
What? You sure?

204
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,116
Unfortunately, yes, but he
did provide me with a lead.

205
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:37,851
The professor hired Burt
through some middleman,

206
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:39,219
a chap named Dave Maddox.

207
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:40,487
There's a good chance

208
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,155
the professor got the
antidotes from him.

209
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:43,456
Oh.

210
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,025
- Detective?
- Oh, sorry.

211
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:46,793
- Wait.
- You okay?

212
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:49,296
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

213
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:51,064
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

214
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,491
Detective!

215
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,773
Detective!

217
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,125
What the hell were you thinking?

218
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:15,560
I thought I was being quite responsible

219
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:17,095
bringing her directly to the hospital.

220
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:18,463
You mean after the two of you

221
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:20,298
- went off and interrogated a
felon on bail? - Well, of course.

222
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,200
It was much easier to
get her here unconscious.

223
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:23,601
You know how stubborn she can get.

224
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:24,869
It doesn't change the fact that...

225
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,971
CHLOE: You guys know
that I'm right here, yeah?

226
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:30,007
Hey.

227
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:31,509
Hey.

228
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:32,844
How you feeling?

229
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:35,747
Fine.

230
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:38,541
Lucifer, I told you no hospitals.

231
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:40,309
How am I supposed to find the antidote

232
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,278
if I'm laying here... ow.

233
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,480
DAN: Shh.

234
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:47,783
We'll take it from here.

235
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:49,885
Yes. Yes, we will.

236
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,154
And we'll start by
following up on your lead.

237
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:53,856
Dave Maddox. Yes.

238
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:54,890
Thank you.

239
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:57,893
Is Trixie here?

240
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:00,129
She should be any minute.

241
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,263
I'll go check.

242
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:08,162
I don't want Trixie to get
scared seeing me like this.

243
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:09,263
Do I look okay?

244
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:14,268
You... you look heaven-sent.

245
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:18,238
(sighs)

246
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:25,345
♪ There's a dream they sell
you when you're young... ♪

247
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:27,648
(indistinct chatter)

248
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,185
Just... follow my lead and don't
do anything unless I say, okay?

249
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:32,586
If that's what it takes,

250
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,121
then you have my word.

251
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:36,790
Dearie me, these are atrocious.

252
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:39,526
What self-respecting artist
would actually display these?

253
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:41,261
Dave Maddox isn't a real artist.

254
00:10:41,263 --> 00:10:42,396
To say the least.

255
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:44,164
All this is just a front.

256
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,466
See, criminals like Maddox,

257
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:47,601
they use art sales to
cover up money transfers.

258
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:48,969
They could demand

259
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,604
any price for a piece of art,

260
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:53,307
and in return provide whatever
it is their clients really want.

261
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:56,410
Can he provide an eye bath?
I'll need one after this.

262
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:58,112
There he is.

263
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,781
Remember what I said.

264
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:02,916
My word is my bond.

265
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:07,521
Dave Maddox?

266
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:08,589
We need to talk.

267
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:10,057
Just one moment, all right?

268
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:10,991
No, it's urgent.

269
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:12,659
It's about your other business.

270
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:14,394
Specifically, with
Professor Jason Carlisle.

271
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:15,996
LUCIFER: Help us get
the professor's antidote,

272
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:18,532
and we'll get out of your
children's art festival.

273
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,335
Can you just...

274
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:23,837
give me one minute? Yeah.

275
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,540
I... have no idea what
you're talking about.

276
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:27,808
DAN: Don't mess with us

277
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,576
- right now, man, it's my wife...
- Ex-wife.

278
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:31,812
My ex-wife's life is on the line.

279
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:36,049
(chuckles) You... so you're
trying to help your ex-wife?

280
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:38,886
Something's wrong with you, buddy.

281
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:40,154
LUCIFER: Maybe not the best time

282
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:41,388
to push that particular button.

283
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,357
Yeah?

284
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,092
If she's anything like my ex,

285
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:46,794
I say let her die.

286
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,328
(scoffs, chuckles)

287
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:58,839
(grunts)

288
00:11:58,841 --> 00:11:59,973
(growls)

289
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:03,477
Now, see, I would do this myself,

290
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,946
but painting hand and all that.

291
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:08,182
You are making a big mistake.

292
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:09,650
MADDOX: You're right.

293
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:11,652
(scoffs) I can just find
something to hit you with!

294
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:12,786
Duh!

295
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:16,423
Right, I'm not sure what
lead I'm following here,

296
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:18,392
but am I supposed to
let them punch me, too?

297
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:21,695
What? No.

298
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:24,264
I screwed up. Okay, Lucifer?

299
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,933
I let my anger get the better of me

300
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,367
and now Chloe's gonna pay for it.

301
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:29,636
What, so this isn't some
elaborate game of bloody possum?

302
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:30,737
Of course not!

303
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:32,472
Oh, well, in that case...

304
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:33,674
(handcuffs loosening)

305
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,276
Wait, are you kidding me?

306
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:38,579
You could have gotten out
of those this whole time?

307
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:39,780
Well, of course I could.

308
00:12:39,782 --> 00:12:41,014
Right, catch.

309
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:46,053
Why the hell didn't you stop them

310
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:47,054
from beating the crap out of me?

311
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,155
Because I promised you

312
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:50,090
I wouldn't do anything
without your permission.

313
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:51,892
Oh, right. Of course.

314
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:52,926
Right.

315
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:55,762
(handcuffs loosening)

316
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:57,865
- This is gonna have to...
- LUCIFER: Take a swing

317
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,233
and I'll shove that so far up your ass,

318
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:00,734
you'll have splinters in your stool.

319
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:05,973
Right.

320
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:08,842
Since torture takes too
long and Dan's already wasted

321
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:11,211
so much time, why don't we speed
things along and make a deal?

322
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:12,913
You have something we want.

323
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:14,214
What would you like in return?

324
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:15,749
Wait, what?

325
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,218
Quickly, now. What is it you desire?

326
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:21,088
I want...

327
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,422
Hmm?

328
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:24,091
I-I want someone to buy my art

329
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:25,592
because they actually like it.

330
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:27,327
(sighs)

331
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:28,896
Clients only buy my paintings because

332
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:31,765
they're forced to as
part of our deal, but...

333
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:34,101
I know they just throw 'em away.

334
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:35,836
And treat 'em like trash.

335
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:38,238
An insult to trash.

336
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,140
All I want...

337
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:42,276
more than anything, is just...

338
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:44,077
is to be treated like a real artist.

339
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,380
Really? That's it?

340
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:48,115
(sighs)

341
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:49,917
Well, miracles aren't my thing,

342
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,618
but I'm sure we can
come to an arrangement.

343
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,086
(sniffles)

344
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:54,388
(sighs)

345
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:59,960
The sacrifices we make
for the greater good.

346
00:13:59,962 --> 00:14:01,762
What? You're not the
one that has to look

347
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:04,031
at this monstrosity every day.

348
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,132
Ah.

349
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:08,602
Here you go.

350
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:11,892
What is this?

351
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,540
It's the antidote ingredients

352
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:14,675
I gathered for Professor Carlisle.

353
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:15,742
Well, what about the formula?

354
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:16,777
What about it?

355
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:17,844
We need to know the amounts

356
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:18,946
of each ingredient he used.

357
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:20,514
If we get it wrong, it could be lethal.

358
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:23,150
The professor kept the
formula all to himself.

359
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:24,587
He liked to brag about

360
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:27,187
how the only place it
existed was in his head.

361
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:28,422
You'd... you'd have to ask him.

362
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:29,790
Yeah, well, we can't do that.

363
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:31,058
He's dead.

364
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,960
Oh.

365
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:35,529
Um...

366
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:37,097
you still want the
painting though, right?

367
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:39,533
Uh...

368
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,511
Amenadiel told me about your detective.

369
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:53,814
I'm sorry, son.

370
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:56,550
(scoffs)

371
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:59,386
I can't even go in there.

372
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:03,156
I'd have to tell her how
monumentally screwed she is.

373
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:05,692
(laughs) Or... or lie.

374
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:08,095
And we both know I can't do that.

375
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:10,964
Well, if it's any consolation,

376
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:12,265
you of all people should know

377
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:15,102
that the man that did this
is right where he belongs:

378
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:16,870
suffering in Hell.

379
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:20,774
You're right. That... that's it.

380
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:23,610
Well, I'm glad I was
able to comfort you.

381
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:24,711
No, no, Mum, you figured it out.

382
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:26,213
How I'm gonna save the detective.

383
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:28,582
Um, I'm not sure I understand.

384
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:31,018
I'm gonna pop down to Hell and
have a chat with the professor.

385
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,686
What? How?

386
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:34,054
Well, it's simple. (chuckles)

387
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:37,975
- All I need to do is die.
- (Mom gasps)

388
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,442
The plan is simple:

389
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,411
you kill me, I go down to Hell,

390
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,612
interrogate the professor,

391
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,869
get the formula and
then you bring me back.

392
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:52,860
Well, come on! Who's in?

393
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:55,663
This is a terrible idea.
I absolutely forbid it.

394
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,932
MAZE: I hate to agree with Her Highness,

395
00:15:57,934 --> 00:15:59,100
but she's right.

396
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:00,535
You'd be on your own.

397
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:01,702
We both know

398
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:02,937
I can't go down with you.

399
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:04,672
Well, I went down and
came back once before,

400
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:05,806
it wasn't a problem.

401
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:07,608
That's because Father brought you back.

402
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,077
MAZE: And you didn't go
through any of the doors.

403
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,813
Once you do, you could
be trapped... forever.

404
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,315
Well, that won't happen, will it?

405
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,183
I'm the Lord of Hell,
for crying out loud.

406
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,652
You <i>were</i> the Lord of Hell.

407
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:19,587
You've been away

408
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:20,821
quite a long time.

409
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:22,757
You can't be certain
that this will work.

410
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,658
(scoffs)

411
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,426
(chuckles, sighs)

412
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:27,028
What do you think?

413
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:31,866
I think...

414
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:36,070
that I followed about half of that.

415
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:41,275
Do you guys do this a lot?

416
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:44,679
Like, celestial planning sessions?

417
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,647
AMENADIEL: Oh,
apparently not. Otherwise,

418
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:48,316
we would have had a meeting
about carelessly revealing

419
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:49,750
our true nature to a human.

420
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:51,218
- Oh...
- Which...

421
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,955
she has apparently known about
for a while and kept from me.

422
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:55,389
Yeah, well, turnabout's fair play.

423
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:56,257
Hmm.

424
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,059
LINDA: Okay, wrapping my brain

425
00:16:58,061 --> 00:16:59,293
around this...

426
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:00,795
Lucifer, what makes you so sure

427
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:01,862
you'd go to Hell?

428
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:03,097
In case you've missed it, doctor,

429
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:04,198
I've been banned from Heaven.

430
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,666
There's no where else for me to go.

431
00:17:05,668 --> 00:17:08,002
And you're sure there's
no other way to get there?

432
00:17:08,004 --> 00:17:09,503
I mean... (scoffs)

433
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:10,771
I mean, dying?

434
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:12,707
Well, if anyone has a better suggestion,

435
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,295
by all means, speak up now.

436
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,043
Quite frankly, I'd prefer to Uber there.

437
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:17,712
But...

438
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:20,848
look, I am doing this
with or without you.

439
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,650
Well, I'm sorry.

440
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:26,153
Having spent millennia
in that terrible place,

441
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:28,489
I can't be part of you going back.

442
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,157
Not even for a moment.

443
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:31,926
Fine.

444
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:34,829
(sighs) Amenadiel?

445
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:37,365
Are you coming?

446
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:41,355
No, Mom, I'm gonna help.

447
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:44,572
Chloe, she doesn't deserve this.

448
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:46,207
MAZE: This is the craziest plan

449
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:47,475
I've ever heard.

450
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:49,510
I'm in.

451
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:53,047
Doctor, surely you have
some sensible advice.

452
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:54,448
Um, he's the Devil.

453
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:57,018
Nothing's really been sensible

454
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,467
since I found that out.

455
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:01,856
I will not help you
get trapped down there.

456
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:05,126
Not for some insignificant human's life.

457
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:07,528
(footfalls receding)

458
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,163
LUCIFER: Okay.

459
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:12,066
Now that party pooper's gone,
let's get started, shall we?

460
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:13,401
So, um,

461
00:18:13,403 --> 00:18:16,871
what's my part in all of this?

462
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:19,106
Well, you went to
medical school, correct?

463
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:22,209
Many... many, many, many years ago.

464
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:24,645
Good. So you'll be the one
bringing me back from the dead.

465
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,049
Okay, who wants to kill me?

466
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:30,985
(scoffs)

467
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:36,190
LUCIFER: Ah, Daniel, there
you are. Have you gathered

468
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:38,059
the ingredients for the antidote yet?

469
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:40,661
What? No, I've just been
spending time with Chloe.

470
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:43,698
Besides, those ingredients are
useless without the formula.

471
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,865
Well, you might want to hop on it,

472
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:46,367
because I'm about to get the formula.

473
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:47,601
What? How?

474
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:49,203
Fairly certain you don't want to know.

475
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:52,006
Well, you... You do what you have to.

476
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:53,507
Ella and I will get those ingredients.

477
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,409
Right.

478
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:07,455
LINDA: <i>This is crazy.</i>

479
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:08,489
I can't do this.

480
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,590
Yeah, and neither can I.

481
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:11,726
These scrubs are so boxy.

482
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:14,095
Even I can't pull 'em off.

483
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:16,630
Scratch that.

484
00:19:16,632 --> 00:19:18,899
I can pull off anything.

485
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,434
Yes, you're right. We can do this.

486
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:21,602
We can do this, right?

487
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:22,770
We have to.

488
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:24,972
- Chloe's life depends on it.
- This is it.

489
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:27,441
This is the room directly below Chloe's.

490
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:29,944
LUCIFER: <i>Make sure no one</i>

491
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:30,945
moves the detective.

492
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:32,379
I'll be in the room below,

493
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:33,914
but she needs to remain
in there for this to work.

494
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,750
Because being close to
her makes you vulnerable.

495
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:38,519
Well, killable, in this case, but yes.

496
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:40,354
So I keep her here until you're dead?

497
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:42,923
No, no, no. The entire time.

498
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:44,391
Even after you've already been killed?

499
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,993
Well, who knows what happens
if I become invulnerable

500
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,161
when I'm already dead.

501
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:48,729
There's a good chance

502
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:50,097
the doctor won't be able to revive me.

503
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,066
And we don't want me
to stay dead, do we?

504
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,101
That was a rhetorical question.

505
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:55,569
- Right.
- Right.

506
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,204
And you trust me with this?

507
00:19:57,206 --> 00:19:58,272
Brother,

508
00:19:58,274 --> 00:19:59,840
you're the most stubborn,

509
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:01,142
bullheaded person I know.

510
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:03,377
If anyone can prevent the detective

511
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:04,812
from being moved, it's you.

512
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:06,981
Luci?

513
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:09,759
What? What?

514
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:11,317
Good luck.

515
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:12,386
Don't worry, brother.

516
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,908
It feels like a good day to die.

517
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:25,585
DAN: Ella?

518
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:27,420
You got a package from CDC.

519
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:29,022
How many more ingredients do we need?

520
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:31,191
Well, based off the list
from that middleman dude,

521
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:32,659
we've gathered all but one:

522
00:20:32,661 --> 00:20:34,294
a chemical called ZX3.

523
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:36,029
Super rare, super illegal.

524
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:37,030
How rare?

525
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:38,164
Let's put it this way:

526
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,833
all my legal contacts
are out of this stuff.

527
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:41,534
Wait, you have illegal contacts?

528
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:43,654
You don't? Whatever.

529
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,574
Some street racers secretly
add drops of ZX3 to their fuel

530
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:48,708
for a super shady advantage.

531
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,676
How do you know that?

532
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:51,878
I used to steal cars.

533
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,947
It's not fun if you don't
drive 'em really, really fast.

534
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:55,582
Anyway,

535
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:58,785
I know where some black
market ZX3 is locked up:

536
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:00,253
a chop shop in NoHo.

537
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:03,156
Problem is, I'm not sure I can
get the owner to hand it over.

538
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:04,658
And we don't have time for a warrant.

539
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,027
Well, desperate times...

540
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:08,428
Call for a little B&E.

541
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,796
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

542
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:12,832
- (monitor beeping)
- Right, so one zap

543
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,668
of this doohickey will stop my heart?

544
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,604
Uh, the defibrillator wasn't
made for that, but yes.

545
00:21:17,606 --> 00:21:19,973
Not what I thought I'd
be doing with my day.

546
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:21,741
I'm gonna give you 60 seconds,

547
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:23,510
then restart your
heart to bring you back.

548
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:25,912
60 seconds? I've had
orgasms that last longer.

549
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:28,148
Time moves much slower
down there. Remember?

550
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,516
Yes, but we only get one shot at this.

551
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:31,284
What if you yank me out
before I get the formula?

552
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:33,687
60 seconds is already cutting
it closer than I'd like.

553
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,855
The brain only lasts
three minutes after death.

554
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:37,457
- (sighs)
- Or so I read.

555
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:40,193
Just now. Like, on the ride over.

556
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:42,562
Why am I doing this again?

557
00:21:42,564 --> 00:21:43,382
Because you care about

558
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:45,532
saving the detective's
life almost as much as I do.

559
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:46,833
Now, come on!

560
00:21:46,835 --> 00:21:48,468
I also care about your life, Lucifer!

561
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:53,807
Okay, ice to slow your
brain cells from dying,

562
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:55,442
and painkillers to, well, kill the pain.

563
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,143
Got it covered, thanks.

564
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:58,945
LINDA: Okay, Maze,
just like I showed you.

565
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:01,047
Yeah, got it.

566
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:02,649
(exhales)

567
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,020
Okay. You ready?

568
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:14,189
- I can't! You do it.
- No, no, no, no.

569
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:16,096
No, the deal was you kill
him, I bring him back.

570
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:18,164
- But you're the doctor!
- And you're the demon from Hell!

571
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,399
Goodness sake.

572
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:22,702
- (thump, then flatline)
- Whoa!

573
00:22:22,704 --> 00:22:24,771
Oh, my God.

574
00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:25,872
He's dead.

575
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,736
He's really dead.

576
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:46,259
(echoing footsteps)

577
00:22:56,705 --> 00:22:57,871
Who are you?

578
00:22:57,873 --> 00:22:59,339
I'm Amenadiel.

579
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:00,917
I'm Lucifer's brother.

580
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:04,677
He, uh, asked me to watch over your mom.

581
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,013
Like a guardian angel?

582
00:23:07,015 --> 00:23:08,381
(chuckles)

583
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:10,550
I like your necklace.

584
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:11,851
Thanks.

585
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:14,387
I, um, I like yours too.

586
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:19,592
A bad man did this to my mommy.

587
00:23:21,563 --> 00:23:24,164
Why are there bad people in the world?

588
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:27,634
I really don't know.

589
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:31,805
There might be bad people in
the world, but you know what?

590
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:33,740
There's a lot more good people in it.

591
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:34,941
Really?

592
00:23:34,943 --> 00:23:36,609
Yeah.

593
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:38,678
Like all the good people
helping out your mom.

594
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:42,048
Like you?

595
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,951
Well, I'm, uh...

596
00:23:44,953 --> 00:23:46,453
I'm trying to be good.

597
00:23:46,455 --> 00:23:48,621

It keeps happening. Over and over.

00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:22,048
It's like I'm in Hell!

624
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,483
There's no "like" about it.

625
00:25:25,153 --> 00:25:26,386
What is this?

626
00:25:26,388 --> 00:25:29,956
This is a torture of your own making.

627
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,090
Fueled by guilt.

628
00:25:31,092 --> 00:25:32,892
With a little bit of
flair thrown in for fun.

629
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,176
Please.

630
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,962
I need to get out of here.

631
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:37,096
How do I get out?

632
00:25:37,098 --> 00:25:38,498
Well, it's quite simple,

633
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,866
you can't.

634
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:41,254
- What?
- Not until you no

635
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,269
longer believe you deserve it.

636
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:45,705
And I have never seen anyone
pull themselves out of here.

637
00:25:45,707 --> 00:25:47,073
Oh, God, no, no, no.

638
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:49,242
- No, no...
- However,

639
00:25:49,244 --> 00:25:51,411
perhaps making some
amends for your misdeeds

640
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:52,745
might do the trick.

641
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:54,213
Anything. Please.

642
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:55,381
How do I make amends?

643
00:25:55,383 --> 00:25:58,918
Well, before you so
rudely ended your own life,

644
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,253
you poisoned a detective.

645
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:02,121
Someone who I care about very much.

646
00:26:02,123 --> 00:26:05,191
There's still time to save her.

647
00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:07,293
So, if you give me the
formula to her antidote,

648
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:10,063
perhaps your guilt might be alleviated.

649
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:11,431
Yeah?

650
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:14,000
(panting)

651
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:15,969
Tick tock, Professor!

652
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:20,373
There.

653
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,541
The formula.

654
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:23,109
Does that make us good?

655
00:26:23,111 --> 00:26:26,145

656
00:26:26,147 --> 00:26:27,280
You tell me.

(sighs)

658
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:34,220
I didn't think so.

659
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,257
No.

660
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:39,726
No, please!

661
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:40,793
No!

662
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:42,929
<i>No! No!</i>

Where's a resurrection
when you need one?

00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:02,949
Could really use my

well as you, brother.

671
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:51,722
I...

672
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:53,190
I know.

673
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:54,858
It's a lot to take in, isn't it?

674
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,594
I don't...

675
00:27:57,596 --> 00:28:00,130
(laughs)

676
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:03,300
I-I don't understand, Azrael's blade,

677
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:05,335
it should've destroyed
you, not sent you to Hell.

678
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:07,271
You don't deserve to be here, brother.

679
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:08,972
You're right, I don't.

680
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:10,440
But you do.

682
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:17,581
You think it's that easy to let go?

683
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:19,919
Think again, brother.

684

686
00:28:27,226 --> 00:28:30,427
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, what's happening?

687
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:31,962
What's happening?

688
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:34,364
I need to save the detective.

689
00:28:34,366 --> 00:28:37,200
But you just can't
help yourself, can you?

690
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:39,469
(Lucifer whimpers, knife unsheaths)

691
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,873
You have to believe me,

692
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,508
I didn't want this.

693
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,577
And yet...

694
00:28:49,214 --> 00:28:50,414

I thought you said
this would work, Linda!

699
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:03,061
Shh! Clear!

700
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:08,098
No, no, no!

701
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,600
What was I thinking?

702
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:12,995
This was always a terrible idea.

703
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:19,810
You know, we are not cat burglars.

704
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:21,511
We are totally gonna get caught.

705
00:29:21,513 --> 00:29:22,713
"Cat burglars"?

706
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:24,548
What are you, an old-timey desperado?

707
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,917
I'm just saying we're a
little out of our element.

708
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:28,518
Speak for yourself.

709
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,620
Yeah, I noticed.

710
00:29:29,622 --> 00:29:31,555
Where'd you learn to
pick a lock like that?

711
00:29:31,557 --> 00:29:32,623
My grandma.

712
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:33,857
Wow.

713
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,659
And what exactly are
we looking for again?

714
00:29:35,661 --> 00:29:37,327
- MAN: Hey!
- (rifle cocks)

715
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:39,162
You picked the wrong place to rob.

716
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,466
(yells) I'm sorry.

717
00:29:42,468 --> 00:29:44,901
I'm sorry, I can't make it stop.

718
00:29:44,903 --> 00:29:45,902
"It?"

719
00:29:45,904 --> 00:29:48,405
As if you had no part in it.

720
00:29:48,407 --> 00:29:50,307
I don't! I didn't.

721
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:51,408
I-I don't want this!

722
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,509
Look at you.

723
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:54,378
So pitiful.

724
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,279
Stuck in the very Hell you once ruled.

725
00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:58,482
Trapped by your own guilt.

726
00:29:58,484 --> 00:30:00,350
And while we're pointing
out how lame you are,

727
00:30:00,352 --> 00:30:03,053
you didn't even follow up
on that thing I told you.

728
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:06,723
What I whispered in
your ear before I died.

729
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:08,425
What?

730
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:10,961
<i>"The peace is here"?</i>

731
00:30:10,963 --> 00:30:13,063
The peace is here.

732
00:30:13,065 --> 00:30:15,832
I... I thought that was just nonsense.

733
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:19,236
The... the final ramblings
of a dying brain. I...

734
00:30:19,238 --> 00:30:23,573
Unless you're saying you found
peace in that moment, brother.

735
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:24,775
Oh, Luci, Luci, Luci.

736
00:30:24,777 --> 00:30:26,176
You should know better than that.

737
00:30:26,178 --> 00:30:28,311
I'm all about patterns,

738
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:30,080
predicting the future.

739
00:30:30,082 --> 00:30:31,782
My last words were a clue.

740
00:30:31,784 --> 00:30:33,250
A clue? A clue to what?

741
00:30:33,252 --> 00:30:35,352
Well, you're the one who has
to figure that out, aren't you?

742
00:30:35,354 --> 00:30:36,553
After all,

743
00:30:36,555 --> 00:30:38,655
I'm just in your head.

744
00:30:38,657 --> 00:30:42,726
I'm just a manifestation of
your own guilty conscience.

745
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:44,795
Speaking of... (Lucifer

746

00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:48,732
- Ouch.

748
00:30:50,534 --> 00:30:51,967
No. (panting)

749
00:30:51,992 --> 00:30:53,470
I hope you didn't leave any

750
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:55,505
- unfinished business up on Earth...
- What?

751
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:57,187
...'cause you're never
getting out of here.

752
00:30:59,445 --> 00:31:01,511
(monitor alarm beeping rapidly)

753
00:31:04,883 --> 00:31:05,949
What's happening?

754
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,617
Doctor just paged us. She's in V-tach.

755
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:09,086
I don't know.

756
00:31:09,088 --> 00:31:11,488
- Let's go wait outside, okay?
- Crash cart's on its way.

757
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,558
It's okay, I'm gonna stay with your mom.

758
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,726
Go with the nurse.

759
00:31:15,728 --> 00:31:17,828
(nurses talking indistinctly)

760
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,933
DOCTOR: Go ahead and
turn her on her side.

761
00:31:22,935 --> 00:31:25,035
Crash cart standing by.

762
00:31:25,756 --> 00:31:27,070
NURSE 2: She's seizing.

763
00:31:27,072 --> 00:31:28,505
MAZE: <i>This isn't right.</i>

764
00:31:28,507 --> 00:31:30,574
Something's wrong in Hell.

765
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:31,575
What?

766
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:32,609
He's stuck.

767
00:31:32,611 --> 00:31:33,844
Trapped in one of those cells.

768
00:31:33,846 --> 00:31:35,312
That's why we can't revive him.

769
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:37,180
Okay, so then what do we
have to do to bust him out?

770
00:31:37,182 --> 00:31:39,483
Someone needs to go down
there and pull him out.

771
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:41,618
I'd go, but I can't.

772
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,320
Why not?

773
00:31:43,322 --> 00:31:44,733
Demons don't have a soul.

774
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:46,523
If I die,

775
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:47,991
I just... die.

776
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:50,060
Okay, that's definitely
a discussion topic

777
00:31:50,062 --> 00:31:52,863
for another time, but right
now, every second counts.

778
00:31:52,865 --> 00:31:56,266
And I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

779
00:31:56,268 --> 00:31:58,301
- what if I go?
- What?

780
00:31:58,303 --> 00:32:00,871
You? What makes you think
you'd go to Hell and not Heaven?

781
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:02,539
There are things you
don't know about me.

782
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,875
- No. No way.
- But Maze...

783
00:32:04,877 --> 00:32:06,076
MOM: Send me.

784
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:07,744
MAZE: Well.

785
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:09,446
Look who decided to show up.

786
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:10,781
I'll go down and get him.

787
00:32:10,783 --> 00:32:12,349
You said you'd never go back.

788
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:14,417
Yes, I have a paralyzing
fear of the place.

789
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:16,753
But I would face a thousand
Hells to save my son.

790
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,388
Ever since I escaped,

791
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,924
Hell's been constantly
trying to pull me back.

792
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:23,794
It's only my resistance that allows me

793
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:25,295
to fight its pull.

794
00:32:25,297 --> 00:32:26,630
So, I just...

795
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:30,133
won't resist.

796
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:31,434
So, how do we do this?

797
00:32:31,436 --> 00:32:32,778
It appears

798
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:34,571
that we need to attach
these little wires

799
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:36,072

Then why didn't you
just ask him for the ZX3?

'Cause after I moved out here

838

he totally ghosted me!

I get it. Okay?

840
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:05,377
You want to keep your

ever since I returned, I've been...

885

I've been manipulating you.

...but I've just made things worse.

890

I pushed you and that human closer,

knowing it would crush you

892

I had to. To save you.

And I need to save her now.

900
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:48,239
Mum. Mum? We need to leave.

901
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,576
Mum?

902
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:53,978
Why would we leave?

903
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,314
Uriel is right here.

904
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:58,917
We can stay.

905
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,852
Be a happy family.

906
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:04,556
I've missed you so much, Mother.

907
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,591
Mum?

908
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:07,659
Mum.

909
00:37:07,661 --> 00:37:09,961
Mum!

910
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:11,629
Come on. You pulled me out of my guilt,

911
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:13,965
there's no time to get
stuck in yours. Come on.

912
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,401
- Come on!
- Please, don't abandon me.

913
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,670
- Not again. Please.
- Mum. Mum.

914
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:19,804

No, please.

918
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,610

00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,459
You didn't die after all.

956

957
00:39:27,926 --> 00:39:29,400
I heard you saved me.

00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:31,436
Well...

959
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:33,204
much as I'd like to take all the credit,

960
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:35,239
this one was a... a team effort.

961
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:41,629
You know, this whole
poisoning thing has just...

962
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,549
...really put a pause on everything

963
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:47,151
that's been going on
with you and I, so...

964
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:50,855
should we just pick
up where we left off?

965
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:56,594
I think, right now,
you just need to focus

966
00:39:56,596 --> 00:39:58,196
on feeling better, Detective.

967
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:02,033
Would you have someone bring Trixie in?

968
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:03,635
Yes. Yes, of course.

969
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:05,370
And we'll talk.

970
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:07,338
We'll talk later, yeah?

971
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,081

972
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,050

973
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,523
MOM: How is the detective?

974
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:27,759
She'll be fine.

975
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,160
And...

976
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:31,229
what about the two of you?

977
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:32,530
(laughs)

978
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:34,265
Well, it was never real, was it?

979
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:36,267
Lucifer, I am so sorry.

980
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:38,302
Father brought her into existence

981
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:40,805
- just to put her in my path.
- Yes.

982
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:42,940
The whole thing's been a sham, Mum.

983
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:44,409
Long con.

984
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:46,244
And I fell for it.

985
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:47,879
You can't blame yourself.

986
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:51,816
This is all His doing. And
He should be punished for it.

987
00:40:51,818 --> 00:40:53,885
Oh, make no mistake, I plan on that.

988
00:40:53,887 --> 00:40:55,987
I mean, how can I
trust anything, anyone,

989
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:59,057
now that I know He
might be behind it all?

990
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:00,625
Well, you can trust me.

991
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:01,626
Can I, Mum?

992
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,461
- Yeah.
- You're as bad as He is.

993
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,096
Worse, maybe.

994
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:07,165
At least He doesn't pretend to love me.

995
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:08,232
Lucifer.

996
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:10,835
I <i>do</i> love you.

997
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:12,103
(laughs)

998
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:13,905
I went back to Hell for you.

999
00:41:13,907 --> 00:41:16,240
I helped save the detective, for you.

1000
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:18,109
Doesn't that count for anything?

1001
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:20,278
It's too little too late, Mother.

1002
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:25,717
You set out to break my heart. Well...

1003
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,146
mission accomplished.

1004
00:41:27,171 --> 00:41:28,605

- No.

with Father, I refuse

1007
