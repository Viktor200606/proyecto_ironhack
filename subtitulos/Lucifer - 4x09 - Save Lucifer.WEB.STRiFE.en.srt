1
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:20,492
It'll be great for entertaining
or whatever you guys wanna do.

2
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:23,125
- It's just kind of the perfect house.
- It's gorgeous.

3
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:24,875
- And those marble countertops.
- Right.

4
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:27,367
They really tie the
whole kitchen together.

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,154
And now here's the garage,
room for two cars and storage.

6
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,949
Say, the Murphy twins, they're
your older sisters, right?

7
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,890
- Yes.
- It must be so amazing.

8
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:38,913
It really is.

9
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,247
You know, it's nice to be
a part of a family business.

10
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,457
Are they gonna come by?

11
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,752
They can get pretty busy, but
sometimes they like to pop in

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,170
and surprise people.

13
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,590
And there's really nice neighbors
all around. These neighbors...

14
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:01,958
Lucifer!

15
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,460
Hi.

16
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,564
Erm...

17
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,179
Listen, about everything
that you said last night.

18
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:10,289
It doesn't matter.

19
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:12,302
Er, I really think it does.

20
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,848
No, I'm way beyond that, detective.
You see, I've made a breakthrough.

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,393
Really? What is it?

22
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:19,896
I hate myself.

23
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,023
Well, I'm not quite sure
what to do with that,

24
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:26,067
but it doesn't sound like a good thing.

25
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,986
But of course it is, detective.

26
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,609
All my time with Dr. Linda has been

27
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:31,822
about exploring the denial that I'm in,

28
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,451
but I've overcome that now, I've
had an honest-to-Devil epiphany.

29
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:38,164
Now all my problems should
just, you know, go away.

30
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,957
Well, a new case just came in,

31
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,961
but I really do wanna
talk about this more later.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,338
- I'm gonna grab my keys.
- Alright.

33
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,674
- Hey, Lucifer.
- Ah! Morning, Miss Lopez.

34
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,217
Whoa!

35
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,760
What's wrong with your hand?

36
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,219
Mm?

37
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:58,391
Lucifer, that is the worst case
of psoriasis I've ever seen.

38
00:01:58,393 --> 00:01:59,892
This is impossible.

39
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:01,813
I have some creams in my lab. Hold on.

40
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:22,331
What are you doing?

41
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,088
I'm gonna punish Lucifer
for what he did to you.

42
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,506
Where is my shuriken?

43
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:33,845
I had to hide most of my weapons
so Linda wouldn't get rid of them.

44
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:36,595
Oh, yeah!

45
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,224
Thanks.

46
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:42,060
Maze, you can't hurt Lucifer.

47
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,563
Oh, I definitely can.

48
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,733
No, you can't hurt
him because I love him.

49
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,027
I want him back.

50
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:53,531
I just don't understand
why he would say that...

51
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,908
he doesn't love himself
when he is with me.

52
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,826
What does that even mean?

53
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:00,364
It means,

54
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,245
he is an idiot,

55
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,042
which is typical for Lucifer.

56
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:08,004
Not realizing how lucky he is.

57
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,021
Thanks.

58
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,347
How do I get him back?

59
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,810
Lucifer is like any other man.

60
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,517
He wants what he can't have.

61
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,730
Okay.

62
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:28,486
Okay...

63
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:34,821
I can do that. You know, I just
need to show him that I'm fine.

64
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:37,333
You know, that I'm fine without him.

65
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,911
- I can do that.
- Yeah.

66
00:03:41,162 --> 00:03:43,788
Okay, maybe I can't do that. Okay.

67
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:46,751
Unless you help me.

68
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:50,296
- Please!
- Well...

69
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,844
In the old days,

70
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:58,138
I could just enter
your body and take over.

71
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:03,099
Um... demons used to be
able to possess humans.

72
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:06,394
But only when they'd just died.
But then Lucifer forbade it.

73
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:07,812
Why?

74
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,021
Above my pay grade.

75
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:11,482
Must have pissed off
someone in the Silver City.

76
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,902
It was fun, though.

77
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:17,613
The looks on their faces
when you pop up and be "Rah!"

78
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,460
But it'd have to be coming from
Hell, Eve, so no luck there.

79
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:33,170
Mm.

80
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:36,632
We'll have to do this
the old fashioned way.

81
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:38,258
What is that?

82
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:40,096
You're gonna get your shit together.

83
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:44,098
And then we are gonna go
and rub in Lucifer's face

84
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,597
just how much you don't...

85
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,979
need him.

86
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:11,521
Thank you.

87
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:14,754
Since when do you voluntarily
wear evidence gloves?

88
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:17,340
Detective, it's... well, I...

89
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:20,051
This is about the other night, isn't it?

90
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,594
Lucifer, I don't want you to feel

91
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:24,639
like you have to be someone
you're not when you are around me.

92
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:27,391
And if this is part of the reason
why you think you hate yourself...

93
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,518
No need to worry on
that front, detective.

94
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,677
All my self-hatred is
also self-inflicted.

95
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,887
No one to blame but myself on that.

96
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,652
But I still don't see how
this epiphany solves anything.

97
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,137
Stop!

98
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:42,283
"Hammer time!"

99
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:45,952
'Cause she was killed with a hammer!

100
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:48,829
Come on, guys, I've been
waiting years to do that one.

101
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:50,248
Anyway.

102
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,667
Victim's name is Megan Murphy, 34.

103
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,794
- One half...
- Of the Murphy Twins.

104
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:58,130
Yeah, they're local celebrities
for their twin shtick.

105
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:00,967
- Any suspects?
- The other twin, actually. Moira.

106
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:03,427
She was found standing over
the body, hammer in hand.

107
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,137
She bolted after eyewitnesses saw her.

108
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,431
We have a BOLO out, but
no luck finding her yet.

109
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,101
The realtor who found the body was
the twins' younger sister, Beth.

110
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,394
And according to interviews,

111
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:13,896
Beth wasn't aware of any
tension between the sisters.

112
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:16,859
Sometimes there's a darkness
waiting just under the surface.

113
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:20,027
- Waiting for a chance to emerge...
- You can't touch this!

114
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:22,280
Yes, I get it. It's
the lyrics to the song.

115
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,118
No, it's because I haven't bagged
it yet and you never wear gloves.

116
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,535
Wait, you're wearing gloves.

117
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:29,203
- Did the cream not work?
- Cream?

118
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,461
You know what this is?

119
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,673
Haven't a clue.

120
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,143
Heard you got a suspect on the
run. We'll catch her in no time.

121
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,103
We? What, you two are
working together now?

122
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:55,146
Yeah.

123
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,149
We're partners.

124
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,359
She's got a natural talent
for hunting bounties.

125
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:03,029
Er, don't you need an
actual bounty to be put out?

126
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,739
Because right now there isn't one.

127
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:07,658
Like to get a head start
on the competition, Chloe.

128
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,078
Eve.

129
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:11,873
There was no need to
make a scene at my work.

130
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,968
I'm not!

131
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,843
Listen...

132
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,338
Luce...

133
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,507
What you said...

134
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,966
hurt a lot,

135
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:25,978
but I really think
that the break-up was

136
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:28,281
the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

137
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:29,891
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,600
I'm having more fun than ever with Maze.

139
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,853
I think it's exactly what I needed.

140
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,064
Well, that's wonderful news.

141
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,607
Come on, Eve.

142
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:42,276
We've got a murderous twin to catch.

143
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:43,404
Sounds fun.

144
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,008
How did I do?

145
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,329
Pretty damn good, lady.

146
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:55,500
Is he still looking?
I bet you he's still...

147
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,664
Detective, I need to
talk to you inside, now!

148
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,336
Okay.

149
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,388
Detective, I'm afraid you were right.

150
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,888
Things aren't as simple as I thought.

151
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,224
In fact, my epiphany may
have backfired on me.

152
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,227
What do you mean?

153
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,943
- Is that how your face gets...
- Yes.

154
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:27,613
Though "devil hand" doesn't
have quite the same ring to it.

155
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:29,573
Detective, this hasn't
happened to me before.

156
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,702
It's going to be okay.
We'll figure it out.

157
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:35,913
Put the glove back on and I'm
sure it will go away in no time.

158
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,331
That's just it, detective!

159
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,948
It started out as a
patch of skin, but now...

160
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:41,295
it's spreading.

161
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:48,987
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

162
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,849
This is all your fault.

163
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:56,517
You and your epiphanies.

164
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,562
Turns out self-help
is actually self-harm.

165
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:01,676
Hey, Lucifer, it's okay to be afraid.

166
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,415
That means we're making progress.

167
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:08,696
Oh, we're making progress in
precisely the wrong direction.

168
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:09,824
Oh, Lucifer!

169
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:11,991
What's happening to you?

170
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:13,868
Exactly what I'd like
to find out, and quickly,

171
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,872
because I can't walk around like
O. J. Bloody Simpson forever.

172
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:23,085
Thank you for feeling my pain.
At least it's not my wanking ha...

173
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:28,007
Please tell me you are not
giving birth to that child now.

174
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:31,177
No, no. I'm not due for
another couple of weeks.

175
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,746
It's just Braxton
Hicks contractions. Ah!

176
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,600
Doesn't mean they don't
hurt like a son of a...

177
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:39,080
Alright.

178
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,061
- Better.
- Good.

179
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:42,148
So.

180
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:44,942
We know subconsciously...

181
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:48,903
you control what
happens to your own body.

182
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:53,199
So, some part of you is
reacting to this revelation.

183
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,451
Yes, and it doesn't seem thrilled,

184
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:58,245
so if you could just de-enlighten
me, that'd be lovely, thank you.

185
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:02,293
Look, Lucifer, I think you need
to step forward, not backward.

186
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,420
You need to dig deeper.

187
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:07,465
If you really hate yourself...

188
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:09,842
you need to figure out why.

189
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:20,392
Daniel.

190
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:21,604
I've had a realization.

191
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,815
- I really don't care, man.
- I hate myself.

192
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:28,819
Okay.

193
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:32,196
What's the punch line?

194
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,948
Well, me, apparently.

195
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,909
Because I haven't the
foggiest idea why. Look at me!

196
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:39,328
Why would I ever hate me?

197
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:43,707
- I might have some ideas.
- Which is exactly why I've come to you.

198
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,543
So please tell me more.

199
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,798
Er... well, you don't
take anything seriously.

200
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:51,549
You get away with everything,

201
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,510
- make everything about yourself.
- Yes, Daniel, I know all that.

202
00:10:54,512 --> 00:10:57,314
Please, just dig
deeper into your cold...

203
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:58,683
douchy heart.

204
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,313
You are the reason
Charlotte Richards is dead.

205
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,088
Daniel...

206
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:12,486
I need reasons that are
actually my fault, not excuses.

207
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:14,991
I should have known you'd
be spectacularly useless.

208
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:24,123
So, Moira's on the run.

209
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,585
We have contacted family,
friends, co-workers, nothing.

210
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,088
Still no luck on the BOLO.

211
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:33,632
So, if you were caught standing over
the dead body of your twin sister,

212
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:34,758
where would you run to?

213
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,970
I would run and run.
And never look back.

214
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:41,640
I mean, she literally killed
someone with her exact same face.

215
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:44,228
- How do you do that?
- You'd have to hate yourself.

216
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,980
Hello!

217
00:11:47,982 --> 00:11:49,523
Detective...

218
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:52,067
this woman may have the
answer to my current dilemma,

219
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:54,111
we need to find her immediately.

220
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,322
Sort of what we're
trying to do here, Lucifer.

221
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:59,033
So, Moira's phone
record finally came in.

222
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,787
First call she made after
the murder... her accountant.

223
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:05,497
Oh. If I needed money to skip
town, that's who I'd call.

224
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:08,044
- Let's go talk to him.
- Quickly, we can't waste a moment.

225
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,296
Move!

226
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,384
Am I sexier like this...

227
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,514
or...

228
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:21,694
like this?

229
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:23,556
Er...

230
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,187
I don't know. Yeah.

231
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,725
What do you think?

232
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:32,608
Oh!

233
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,902
Maybe this isn't going to work.

234
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,528
Where are they, anyway?

235
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,491
They got the same phone records we did.

236
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,243
I promise they will be here.

237
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,871
Okay, okay.

238
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,955
Okay.

239
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:49,875
What about dating someone else?

240
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:51,783
Someone...

241
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:53,464
not Lucifer?

242
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,267
Oh, my God!

243
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:02,096
You're right!

244
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:03,806
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

245
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:05,099
Of course!

246
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:07,601
Nothing better to get his jealousy going

247
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:10,314
than to see me happy with
someone else, of course!

248
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:14,316
How about that detective
he hates so much?

249
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:15,359
You know...

250
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,142
Don?

251
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:18,362
The douchy one.

252
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,642
- Dan!
- Or...

253
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:24,368
Maybe you deserve better.

254
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,538
Like who?

255
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,178
Ah!

256
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,141
Oh. Hi, guys.

257
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:48,262
Hi!

258
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:51,161
Didn't see you there.

259
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,273
Ah.

260
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,356
Sure didn't.

261
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:56,277
Mm!

262
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:05,035
Oh! Did you see his face?

263
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,537
You are a genius. Of course!

264
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:12,458
Being with you would make him
super-jealous. Oh, my God! Thank you!

265
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:14,754
You're welcome.

266
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:17,921
Thank you!

267
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,175
These two maniacs barged
in here and tied me up!

268
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:23,471
Yes, I can see you've had a
most unpleasant time so far.

269
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:27,014
Well, it wasn't all bad.

270
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:29,725
- Back to...
- I need you to focus.

271
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:32,936
Tell me, why did Moira
hate herself so much?

272
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,147
Hate herself? She didn't hate herself.

273
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:37,941
She must have, she literally
killed a mirror image of herself.

274
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,359
I need to understand why.

275
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:41,612
She called you after the
murder. What did she want?

276
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,907
Well, that's the thing.

277
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:47,077
She called to accuse
me of killing Megan.

278
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,705
Why would Moira accuse you of murder?

279
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:54,792
I tried to ask her that,
but then she hung up on me.

280
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,127
I love those girls.
They're like family to me.

281
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,087
Less motive, more location.

282
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:00,758
Where is she? Or I gag you again.

283
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:03,076
No, you will not.

284
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,386
And we're gonna talk about
proper procedure later on.

285
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:11,225
Um, they owned a lot of properties.
Maybe Moira is at one of those?

286
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:12,976
I can get you the address.

287
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,329
Great.

288
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:20,277
Sorry you had to see that.

289
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,113
What? Oh, the snogging.

290
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:25,989
No need to apologize for a bit of fun.

291
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,491
Well...

292
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,661
when the lightning strikes,
it strikes, I guess.

293
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:35,209
Oh. So what? You're saying that
you and Maze are together together?

294
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,296
I was just looking for
the right time to tell you.

295
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,881
Well, all I care is
that you are happy, Eve.

296
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:43,884
Genuinely.

297
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:47,511
- Are you, though?
- Why wouldn't I be?

298
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,514
Did Megan do anything strange
before she was murdered?

299
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,058
Anything to help us figure
out who killed her?

300
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,586
Her sister killed her.

301
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,563
Maybe, but murderers don't
often use their first phone call

302
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:59,356
to accuse someone else.

303
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,192
Megan took over her company's
finances a couple of months ago.

304
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,308
Is that normal?

305
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:06,572
I figured that she wanted to be
more involved in the business.

306
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:08,574
But, then, two days ago,

307
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:12,619
she dropped off a thumb drive
with a copy of her financial files.

308
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:14,248
Which isn't strange, but...

309
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:17,457
she did seem upset.

310
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,459
Did you notice anything
odd in the files?

311
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:22,796
I haven't looked, but the thumb
drive is in the filing cabinet.

312
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:24,430
- Can I see it?
- Sure.

313
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:27,094
Of course I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?

314
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:31,889
You and Maze... it's
just a bit surprising.

315
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,685
Well, if you think someone
else would make me happier...

316
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:38,145
- then maybe...
- Hey, Lucifer!

317
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:41,189
- You look cold.
- Detective, I know I'm wearing gloves,

318
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:43,991
- but it's actually rather warm...
- No. It's best you stay covered up.

319
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,656
Oh! Right. Always so
thoughtful, detective.

320
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:51,410
Detective, there seems to be a problem.

321
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:54,371
- What is it?
- The thumb drive's missing.

322
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:57,583
Someone must have stolen it.

323
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:05,339
What about the name Zoriel?

324
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,134
That's a good name for a warrior.

325
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:09,470
We can call him Zori for short.

326
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,596
Or Ezekiel.

327
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,889
Zek.

328
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:15,389
Yeah.

329
00:17:15,392 --> 00:17:18,479
Erm... I was thinking about the name...

330
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,520
Jack.

331
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:23,248
Mm.

332
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,045
Mm.

333
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:26,756
Short for Jackiel.

334
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:31,365
We could definitely
put that on the list.

335
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:32,824
Right after Azmortiel.

336
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:35,953
I was hoping for a more mainstream name.

337
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:39,706
Our child is going to have enough
challenges considering his nature.

338
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,628
All these names are very mainstream
in the Silver City, Linda.

339
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:46,507
But that's not where he is
going to be living, is it?

340
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:48,952
No.

341
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:51,968
No, of course not.

342
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,137
But I suppose he could visit.

343
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,517
You could fly him up and
back down on holidays.

344
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:59,309
Do you guys have holidays?

345
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,189
No, not really.

346
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:04,898
But that sounds great.

347
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,527
- What about Michael?
- No.

348
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:09,319
Definitely not Michael.

349
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,696
Let's keep looking, then.

350
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:11,573
Okay.

351
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:16,388
Ah! Sorry I'm late, detective.

352
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:18,954
I had to run home to
replace your ghastly scarf.

353
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:21,667
One thing I refuse to hate
about myself is my style.

354
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:25,504
Did you think I was Chloe?

355
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,088
Easy mistake, I guess.

356
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,424
We are both thoughtful...

357
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:33,093
- smart...
- Okay, where is the detective?

358
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,721
You haven't murdered her and
assumed her identity, have you?

359
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:38,181
Lucifer... no.

360
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,225
Maze and I brought in the runaway twin.

361
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:43,216
I believe Chloe is
interrogating her as we speak.

362
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:44,398
Great.

363
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:46,567
Okay. I'll...

364
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:49,901
- I'll go and join her in there.
- Great.

365
00:18:49,903 --> 00:18:51,945
I'll just be here, working on the case,

366
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,491
looking for bad guys to
bring in to justice.

367
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:56,660
Mm-hmm.

368
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:07,085
Ah, there she is.

369
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:09,713
- The answer to all my questions.
- Lucifer...

370
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,883
Tell me, Moira. Did killing
your sister make it go away?

371
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,886
- What?
- Your self-hatred, of course.

372
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,972
If so, do you think if I made a
dummy of myself and murdered it,

373
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:20,390
it might work for me?

374
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,769
What are you talking about?

375
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:24,646
I didn't kill Megan.

376
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,896
Uh?

377
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,334
Two days ago, I got a
notice of an overdraft

378
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,068
on our corporate account.

379
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,736
I called Megan,

380
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,697
because she handles more
of the financial side.

381
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,115
She is the smarter one.

382
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:41,953
Ah, so you hated your own lack of
intelligence and took it out on her!

383
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:44,998
It's not particularly relevant
to myself, but, perhaps...

384
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,418
Moira, please go ahead.

385
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,296
Megan told me it was no big deal.

386
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:54,384
I could tell something was wrong,
but I just figured she'd handle it.

387
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,801
Yesterday...

388
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,931
I knew we were showing
a house, so I went.

389
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,891
But I found Megan...

390
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:03,602
dead on the ground.

391
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,937
I picked up the hammer. It was instinct.

392
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,897
But then I saw Beth staring at me,

393
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:12,234
looking at me like... like
I killed our own sister.

394
00:20:12,236 --> 00:20:14,111
But... but you ran.

395
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:18,156
If you are innocent, why not just
explain to Beth that you didn't do it?

396
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:19,660
Because I looked so guilty!

397
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,496
I figured I had to find
out who the real killer was.

398
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,081
That's why I called Willy.

399
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,375
He claims that Megan
took over the financials

400
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:30,794
for the last couple of months, so...

401
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,756
Maybe someone else had access to them?

402
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,468
Megan's husband.

403
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:39,845
Arnold. Oh, God, it could've been him.

404
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:42,432
Arnold. Okay, good, we
will bring him in and...

405
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,019
Excuse me.

406
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:50,897
Lucifer, look at this.

407
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:53,986
Detective, please, we both know I'm
not a paper trail kind of crime solver.

408
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:57,146
- Is something wrong with his eyes?
- Look again!

409
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,573
- Mm?
- Mm-mm, no, no.

410
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:02,870
He just was up all night
going over the case, he is...

411
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,995
tired.

412
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,623
We will be right back, Moira.

413
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:26,057
- Dan!
- Oh, my!

414
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:30,451
Maze?

415
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:31,812
Hey.

416
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,528
What the hell you doing here?

417
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,738
Just getting some air.

418
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:40,404
Right.

419
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:41,823
Air.

420
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:44,494
In the backseat of my car
that is parked in a garage.

421
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:49,750
Look, I'm sorry...

422
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,460
about what I said to you...

423
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:55,837
at Lux the other
night. I was just drunk.

424
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,883
Dealing... with a lot.

425
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:01,345
I still am, but...

426
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:04,056
I didn't mean what I said.

427
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:07,693
Don't worry about it.

428
00:22:09,353 --> 00:22:10,479
Wait a minute.

429
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,980
I was right about you and Eve, wasn't I?

430
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:15,412
No!

431
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:19,319
But...

432
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:21,406
why did you think that?

433
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,325
Because I've never seen you look
at anyone the way you looked at her.

434
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:28,745
Like you weren't thinking
about stabbing them.

435
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,751
Can I give you some advice?

436
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,086
No.

437
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,090
I only had a few weeks with Charlotte.

438
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:42,010
But we could've had so much more
time together if I hadn't waited.

439
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,264
And I wish I had that time back.

440
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:47,766
Don't make the same mistake I made.

441
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:51,935
If you have feelings for
her, you gotta tell her.

442
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,480
I kind of tried that, you
know. It kind of backfired.

443
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:56,858
So find a way to show her.

444
00:22:58,485 --> 00:22:59,987
Grand gesture and all that.

445
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:01,905
What do you have to lose?

446
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:13,924
Here you go.

447
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,626
Is that the husband with a
high-priced lawyer to boot?

448
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,296
That bodes well for his guilt.

449
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,839
Well, he denied everything

450
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:23,633
and the search warrant for the
house didn't yield any information.

451
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:27,429
Ah, so it is the sister. Killed the
twin and ran off with the evidence.

452
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:29,180
No, we just got the time of death back.

453
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:33,101
Megan died 30 minutes before Moira
was found standing over the body.

454
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:35,145
So she either stopped
to admire her work...

455
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,646
Or it isn't her.

456
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,816
- Does the husband have an alibi?
- No, he's still our best suspect.

457
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,944
Megan's laptop is missing and he
did have easy access to that, so,

458
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:44,988
maybe he was stealing
money from their company.

459
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,032
Maybe she caught him and
they got into a fight.

460
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:49,951
And after a little brutal murder,
he ran off with the evidence.

461
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:52,620
Yeah. We're still trying to get
the husband's financial records

462
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:54,414
to see if he spent a
lot of money recently,

463
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:57,334
but his lawyer is
stonewalling. Er, Lucifer...

464
00:23:57,336 --> 00:24:00,253
What is Eve doing sitting at my desk?

465
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:02,547
Detective, I was going
through the case and...

466
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:03,465
Listen, Eve.

467
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:06,343
If you want to dress
like me, that's fine.

468
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:07,761
Weird, but fine.

469
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:11,224
But this is an official LAPD case file.

470
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:13,977
I think I know how to catch the killer.

471
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,190
Okay, ten seconds, go.

472
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:22,901
Whoever stole the thumb drive was
obviously covering their tracks.

473
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:24,194
- Right?
- Right.

474
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,906
So clearly, there's
something in that file

475
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:29,618
that can help us catch the killer.

476
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,286
But Willy never made a
copy of the thumb drive.

477
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:34,871
But what if he did?

478
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,875
- Er, he didn't.
- What if he did?

479
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:41,586
Well, he didn't, but if we
claimed to have a copy of it...

480
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:44,172
- And then stage a sting.
- Yeah.

481
00:24:44,174 --> 00:24:46,674
Have Moira tell the family

482
00:24:46,676 --> 00:24:50,345
that she is selling off the
company to a wealthy buyer...

483
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:54,307
And then we have Moira present
the fake copy of the financials

484
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:55,975
to Lucifer, at a party at Lux.

485
00:24:55,977 --> 00:24:59,104
Then just sit back and wait
for the husband to steal them.

486
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:00,397
You know...

487
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,316
that's a very good idea, Eve.

488
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:04,444
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

489
00:25:07,197 --> 00:25:08,532
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

490
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:11,118
Yes...

491
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,909
well done...

492
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,536
detective.

493
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,601
Lucifer, where are you?

494
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:31,972
The party started downstairs.
The husband should be here soon.

495
00:25:33,306 --> 00:25:35,432
I'm not going, detective.

496
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,644
Mm?

497
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:43,982
I thought this case would help
me understand my self-hatred,

498
00:25:43,984 --> 00:25:45,777
stop what's happening to me, but...

499
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,363
I think it's time I face the truth.

500
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:50,947
What truth?

501
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,534
The prophecy, it's coming true.

502
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:57,080
"Evil will be released," right?

503
00:25:58,248 --> 00:25:59,789
Well.

504
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,374
The only question that remains

505
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:04,421
is what kind of monster will
I be when it's done releasing?

506
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:07,765
Lucifer, I'm going
to have Father Kinley

507
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:09,716
transferred to our holding cell.

508
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:12,859
If anyone knows more about
the prophecy, it's him.

509
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,138
It will take a couple of hours,

510
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,683
but we will figure this out.

511
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,600
Okay?

512
00:26:18,602 --> 00:26:21,394
Until then, I think it's
best to keep you distracted.

513
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:23,855
I can't go downstairs, detective.

514
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:25,940
Between my sunglasses, scarf and gloves,

515
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:27,861
I'll look like Stevie
Wonder on a snow day.

516
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,451
Don't worry. I got you covered.

517
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:46,082
A masquerade party.

518
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:47,380
Clever.

519
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,677
Detective, you were right.
This is exactly what I needed.

520
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,944
Thank you.

521
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,142
Now, all we have to do is wait
for Megan's husband to arrive.

522
00:27:01,144 --> 00:27:04,606
Then you can take center stage and
hopefully, he will take the bait.

523
00:27:05,732 --> 00:27:07,067
Oh, there is Moira.

524
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:10,028
I'm going to make sure she is okay.

525
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:16,952
Hey.

526
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:22,374
So everything is going
according to plan, huh?

527
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,416
I guess we make a pretty good team, huh?

528
00:27:25,418 --> 00:27:26,503
Indeed.

529
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,466
So, when should I move my stuff back in?

530
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,010
What?

531
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:38,390
Luce, I saw the way you
looked at me at the precinct.

532
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:43,937
I understand that I wasn't giving
you what you needed before, but...

533
00:27:45,188 --> 00:27:46,690
I really think I can now.

534
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,071
Ooh!

535
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,325
Oh, my God. Lucifer...

536
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:02,412
Your eyes, are you
okay? What's happening?

537
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,663
Nothing.

538
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:06,624
Just an end-of-the-world
prophecy being fulfilled.

539
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:09,043
But... maybe you can help me.

540
00:28:09,045 --> 00:28:10,420
Yeah.

541
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,423
Of course. Of course, anything.

542
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,042
Eve...

543
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:16,542
why don't you hate me?

544
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,013
- What do you mean?
- I treated you terribly,

545
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:22,682
I hurt you, I used you.

546
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:24,892
No, you didn't...

547
00:28:24,894 --> 00:28:27,020
I did! Deep down, I knew
it wasn't gonna work,

548
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:29,856
but I strung you along anyway
for my own selfish wants,

549
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:32,277
so why don't you hate me?

550
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:34,988
Because I love you.

551
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,911
Well, you shouldn't.

552
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,387
This is for a special girl.

553
00:29:00,764 --> 00:29:02,557
A grand gesture to help...

554
00:29:03,516 --> 00:29:04,726

That was...

577
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,687
beautiful.

578
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:15,938
Message received.

579
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,482
Loud and clear.

580
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:18,753
Yeah?

581
00:31:21,154 --> 00:31:24,947
Yeah, I know exactly what I
need to do to get him back now...

582
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,367
a grand gesture!

583
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,287
Thank you.

584
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:41,964
Hey, Ella.

585
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,760
Heard you were looking
for me. What's up?

586
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:47,472
I know it was you, Dan.

587
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,768
What are you talking about?

588
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,644
I went back and tracked
down who's police cruiser

589
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,939
was outside Tiernan's office.

590
00:31:57,106 --> 00:31:58,439
It was yours.

591
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:00,900
Which explains you going
through that trash the other day

592
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,529
- in the conference room.
- You're right.

593
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:07,016
Turn me in.

594
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:08,491
I deserve it.

595
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,141
I won't do that.

596
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:13,287
In fact, I scrubbed your
cruiser's location history.

597
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:14,415
Why would you do that?

598
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,292
Why help me out? It was
unforgivable what I did!

599
00:32:18,294 --> 00:32:21,003
You weren't the one who barged
into Lucifer's penthouse with a gun.

600
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,713
I might as well have been.

601
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:25,093
My daughter almost died
because of what I did.

602
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,886
So why help me out? Why are
you gonna let me off the hook?

603
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:32,723
Why is everybody always letting
me get away with so much bullshit?

604
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:34,058
I'm not.

605
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,770
I just think that you are in pain.

606
00:32:36,896 --> 00:32:38,479
More than any of us realize.

607
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:41,442
And I think maybe now is the
time to finally get some help!

608
00:32:56,082 --> 00:32:58,958
Lucifer, Moira just got a
call from Megan's husband.

609
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,128
Please tell me it's a full confession
so we can skip to the arrest.

610
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,298
No, he's not coming. He couldn't
bear to see the business sold.

611
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,008
So he is not the killer.

612
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,971
Which means this whole charade
is a complete waste of time.

613
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:13,349
Lucifer, your face.

614
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:20,229
Okay, I'm gonna call the precinct.
Hopefully Kinley is there by now.

615
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:24,191
I was just about to call you.

616
00:33:24,193 --> 00:33:26,988
- What's going on?
- Detective Decker, something's happened.

617
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,242
Detective, what is it?

618
00:33:34,892 --> 00:33:36,539
Father Kinley escaped.

619
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:42,754
Thank you for helping me.

620
00:33:43,546 --> 00:33:47,381
God certainly sends us unusual
assistance when we are most in need.

621
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,678
But I must confess...

622
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:54,138
- I'm not sure why you helped.
- Me either.

623
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,975
Well, you know, I need
to redefine things.

624
00:33:57,977 --> 00:33:59,979
Just like you suggested, Maze.

625
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:03,981
It seems like Lucifer is clearly worried

626
00:34:03,983 --> 00:34:05,066
about this prophecy.

627
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:07,318
That must be what's holding him back.

628
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,441
And the father here can help him realize

629
00:34:10,444 --> 00:34:13,032
that is all just a bunch of nonsense.

630
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:15,952
And then he has to love me again.

631
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:18,704
I'm familiar with the demon Mazikeen.

632
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:20,456
But you are...

633
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,999
Oh.

634
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:24,128
Forgive me, Father. I am Eve.

635
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:26,798
Of course.

636
00:34:28,174 --> 00:34:29,425
The first woman.

637
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:32,885
Lucifer's first love.

638
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:34,681
First and only.

639
00:34:38,935 --> 00:34:40,436
Does this mean you'll help me?

640
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,272
I'm sorry, my child, but
now that I know who you are,

641
00:34:45,274 --> 00:34:47,026
the original sinner,

642
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:51,278
I'm all the more convinced
that the prophecy is real.

643
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,658
Lucifer, don't worry,
we'll find Father Kinley.

644
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,744
Let's go to the scene of the
escape see if we can find any clues.

645
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:00,663
Looks like our staying is a bust anyhow.

646
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,082
And right now, your problems
are far too important.

647
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:05,835
- Yes, it appears so.
- I want to divorce my husband.

648
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,671
That's lovely for you to say,
but now's not a good time.

649
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:09,755
I wanna be famous.

650
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:11,524
I wish I hadn't had that tattoo.

651
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,563
I wish I'd told him how I felt...

652
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:15,218
why didn't I tell him?

653
00:35:15,221 --> 00:35:17,138
Lucifer, your mojo!

654
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,433
It's affecting everyone.

655
00:35:19,538 --> 00:35:20,620
Let's go!

656
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:22,852
- Wish I'd left church as a child!
- Move!

657
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,729
I wish I hadn't cheated on him.

658
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:27,356
- Excuse me!
- I want that thumb drive. I need it!

659
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,525
- Out of my way!
- Come with me!

660
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,238
- Out of my way!
- I broke up with my girlfriend.

661
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,665
Get back. Out of the way! Keep away!

662
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:42,329
Beth! You're Megan's younger sister.

663
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:45,583
Why did you want the thumb drive?
You were at the scene of the crime.

664
00:35:45,585 --> 00:35:46,861
I...

665
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,005
I was showing that house.

666
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:54,177
You could've snuck away for a few
minutes without anyone noticing.

667
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,892
Why did you desire
the files on the drive?

668
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:05,605
Because I didn't want anyone
to know what I had done.

669
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:13,905
Ever since Charlotte's death,
I've been pretty angry...

670
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:17,492
at Lucifer.

671
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,871
And it's felt pretty good.

672
00:36:22,758 --> 00:36:24,062
You know...

673
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,168
to have someone to blame.

674
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:30,376
But it's not his fault.

675
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,132
Who's fault is it?

676
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:41,015
I don't know.

677
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:43,893
But you feel like it's
your fault, don't you?

678
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,725
I've been doing some
really stupid things lately.

679
00:36:51,984 --> 00:36:53,111
Like I'm trying to...

680
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:57,740
I don't know.

681
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,952
Punishing yourself?

682
00:37:03,538 --> 00:37:06,040
There's nothing you could
have done to save her.

683
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:11,379
But that doesn't make the
hurt any less, does it?

684
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:21,639
It's a long road to dealing
with a loss like this.

685
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,433
But this is a good beginning.

686
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:28,437
And I think that...

687
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:31,482
You think that what?

688
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:39,071
That you need to take me to the
hospital because my water just broke.

689
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:40,531
Wha...

690
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,961
Hey!

691
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,005
You think you can maybe work
your magic on the priest?

692
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,591
Convince him that he is
wrong about the prophecy,

693
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:02,094
using your knives and
other sharp objects?

694
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:04,471
I've tortured guys like Kinley before.

695
00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:05,806
He is a fanatic.

696
00:38:05,808 --> 00:38:07,810
Nothing I do will change his mind.

697
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:12,190
Okay. That's okay.

698
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,024
That's fine.

699
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,402
I just need to figure out another plan.

700
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:21,280
I got this.

701
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:23,073
Maybe it's Los Angeles, you know?

702
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:26,160
Maybe I just need to
take Lucifer out of town.

703
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:29,997
To just be us again, you know? Just us.

704
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:31,165
No distractions.

705
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:32,791
Enough!

706
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:35,004
Lucifer doesn't love you!

707
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:40,799
I'm sorry, but sometimes you have to...

708
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:41,886
accept when...

709
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:46,766
someone doesn't feel the
same way about you.

710
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:51,771
I have to go.

711
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,113
Moira and Megan were
the perfect sisters.

712
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:04,823
And I was the black sheep.

713
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:06,909
Always screwing up.

714
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,080
Barely even trusted
with showing the houses.

715
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:12,248
Moira never believed in me.

716
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,209
But Megan...

717
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:18,045
Megan knew I could do better,

718
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:21,550
so when I asked if I could
help with the finances...

719
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,511
She kept it secret.

720
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:30,766
And then I heard about
a sure-thing investment.

721
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:34,395
And I was going to use those
profits and start my own business.

722
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:37,334
Pay them back, prove to them
that I wasn't what they thought.

723
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,194
So I borrowed the money.

724
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:43,572
How much did you lose?

725
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,967
All of it.

726
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,584
She said that Moira was right.

727
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:52,123
I ruin everything I touch.

728
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,168
I just lost it.

729
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,878
I don't remember grabbing the hammer.

730
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,928
I barely remember giving that tour
and pretending to find her body.

731
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:08,347
And here is the worst part.

732
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,976
I couldn't bring myself
to tell the truth.

733
00:40:12,935 --> 00:40:15,229
Even if it meant my own
sister going to jail.

734
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:20,399
Maybe Moira was right about me,

735
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:23,152
maybe I do ruin everything I touch.

736
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,530
She was right.

737
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:28,409
You should've stayed away
from everyone you cared about.

738
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:15,441
Hi!

739
00:41:15,534 --> 00:41:16,789
Hi!

740
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:18,040
Okay.

741
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:37,101
Alright, Lucifer, let's go.

742
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:39,144
Kinley's only a couple
of hours ahead of us.

743
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:41,399
I'm afraid is too late, detective.

744
00:41:42,274 --> 00:41:46,235
Well, I know with your mojo going
crazy it's gonna be difficult,

745
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,779
but we'll avoid the crowds and...

746
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:50,032
You know, I think if we...

747
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,953
It's too late.

748
00:41:57,331 --> 00:41:58,791
They won't go back in.

749
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:02,865
This is who I am now.

750
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,562
Hi, sweetie.

751
00:42:22,857 --> 00:42:24,398
No wings yet.

752
00:42:26,035 --> 00:42:27,859
Yeah.

753
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:29,155
I think I have a name.

754
00:42:30,121 --> 00:42:32,999
- Oh, Amenadiel, I don't know.
- What about Charlie?

755
00:42:33,906 --> 00:42:35,337
Charlie?

756
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,650
After Charlotte.

757
00:42:37,462 --> 00:42:38,622
I love it.

758
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:43,876
Charlie...

759
00:42:43,878 --> 00:42:44,962
meet Dad.

760
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,015
You know, we still
don't have a middle name.

761
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,900
It doesn't really
matter what your name is.

762
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:11,530
They are going to love
you in the Silver City.

763
00:43:12,698 --> 00:43:14,283
Where you'll be safe...

764
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:19,997
forever.

765
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:26,585
Okay, I can do this.

766
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:30,508
I can do this. All I need to
do is get Lucifer out of LA.

767
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:32,716
That's all I need.

768
00:43:32,718 --> 00:43:34,092
But where?

769
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:35,593
Okay.

770
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:36,812
Vegas?

771
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:40,057
Paris!

772
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,476
Or...

773
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:43,747
we could just go on a deserted island

774
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,896
where it can just be the two of us.

775
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:47,320
Pardon me, my child.

776
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:50,508
I think I may have a way
to help you, after all.

777
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:51,695
What do you mean?

778
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,072
I know a place you could go with him.

779
00:43:55,074 --> 00:43:58,951
Where he could get away from
the bad influences he's had here.

780
00:43:58,953 --> 00:44:01,253
Where you could be together...

781
00:44:01,256 --> 00:44:03,121
for eternity.

782
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:05,541
Where he could be a king again.

783
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,127
You mean... Hell?

784
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:11,462
Yeah...

785
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:14,299
I don't think Lucifer
wants to go back there.

786
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:17,678
Perhaps Lucifer simply
needs a reason to go back.

787
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,012
After all...

788
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:21,767
he's never been there before
with a queen by his side.

789
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:27,938
- Why are you helping me?
- I've dedicated my life

790
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,107
to preventing the prophecy.

791
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:32,486
If you and Lucifer were to
go to Hell together, well...

792
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:34,947
that would accomplish that.

793
00:44:35,614 --> 00:44:37,283
It would solve both our problems.

794
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:39,201
But I...

795
00:44:40,035 --> 00:44:43,328
I wouldn't even know how
to convince him to go back.

796
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:46,832
Well, perhaps remind
him of the warm welcome

797
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:48,750
that awaits him down there.

798
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,460
All his adoring subjects,

799
00:44:50,462 --> 00:44:52,047
eagerly awaiting his return.

800
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:56,594
Yeah, that actually gives me an idea.

801
00:44:57,344 --> 00:45:02,097
Maze said that demons can enter
the bodies of the recently dead.

802
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,851
So, if one of his subjects
could rise up from Hell,

803
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:07,769
maybe they'd convince him.

804
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,062
That may work.

805
00:45:09,064 --> 00:45:10,230
Yeah.

806
00:45:10,232 --> 00:45:14,359
Now all we need is someone to
deliver the message down to Hell.

807
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:17,906
You know, someone who's about to die...

808
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:21,283
and is...

809
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:22,534
well,

810
00:45:22,536 --> 00:45:24,622
definitely headed down there.

811
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:34,212
I'm so sorry, I really
would like to help,

812
00:45:34,214 --> 00:45:36,465
but there's simply too much at stake.

813
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,592
So the simplest way
to stop the prophecy...

814
00:45:39,595 --> 00:45:44,264
is to simply remove Lucifer's
first love from the equation.

815
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,393
Oh!

816
00:45:59,448 --> 00:46:00,866
Oh, my God! You...

817
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:04,916
You can deliver the message.

818
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:07,537
This is your way of
stopping the prophecy.

819
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:10,415
When you head down there, you tell them

820
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:12,918
to come and get their king, okay?

821
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,382
You tell them to come
and help me save Lucifer.

822
00:46:17,132 --> 00:46:18,507
Why...

823
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,802
Why would you think...

824
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:22,552
I'm going to hell?

825
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,809
Just a hunch.

826
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,693
I know why I hate myself.

827
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:40,516
Because everything I touch, I ruin.

828
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:41,988
From...

829
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,825
rebellion against Dad to now.

830
00:46:44,827 --> 00:46:46,952
Look at what I put you through.

831
00:46:46,954 --> 00:46:48,537
I hate...

832
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,709
that I am poison for anyone
who dares to care about me.

833
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:55,963
And especially you.

834
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:05,021
Lucifer...

835
00:47:05,024 --> 00:47:06,432
this isn't about me.

836
00:47:08,517 --> 00:47:09,732
I'm okay.

837
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,006
I haven't crumbled
into a million pieces.

838
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:20,529
I'm still here.

839
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:22,738
And I'm fine.

840
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,242
If I turn around, will you be fine
or will you look away in horror?

841
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:30,162
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it does, detective.

842
00:47:30,164 --> 00:47:31,872
No, it doesn't.

843
00:47:31,874 --> 00:47:33,957
Because this isn't about me.

844
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:35,279
This is about you.

845
00:47:36,211 --> 00:47:38,044
Not gonna let you use me as an excuse

846
00:47:38,046 --> 00:47:41,091
to avoid dealing with
what is behind all of this.

847
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,042
You always talk about how much you hate

848
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:47,308
being blamed for humanity's sins.

849
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,067
You know, "The Devil made me do it,"

850
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,310
and I think I know why you hate
it so much, because deep down,

851
00:47:53,312 --> 00:47:55,689
you blame yourself just as much...

852
00:47:56,315 --> 00:47:57,399
if not more!

853
00:47:58,233 --> 00:48:02,112
You have to stop taking responsibility
for things you can't control.

854
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,364
Lucifer...

855
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:08,784
you need to forgive yourself.

856
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:10,418
I can't.

857
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:11,622
Why?

858
00:48:13,582 --> 00:48:15,278
I don't know how to.

859
00:48:16,877 --> 00:48:18,879
I don't even know where to begin.

860
00:48:22,257 --> 00:48:23,924
But...

861
00:48:23,926 --> 00:48:25,261
But what?

862
00:48:34,293 --> 00:48:35,604
I want to.

863
00:48:44,112 --> 00:48:45,948
Lucifer!

864
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:49,785
I think you just took the first step.

865
00:48:55,624 --> 00:48:58,750
- Look at that, detective.
- You're okay.

866
00:48:58,752 --> 00:49:00,043
We did it!

867
00:49:03,715 --> 00:49:06,862
It looks like evil won't
be released after all.
