1
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:03,174
So, if any of you are considering
going into experimental physics,

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:05,008
my door is always open.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:08,053
Once again, I'm sorry
the demonstration didn't quite work out,

4
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:10,602
but now we know what happens
when you accidentally spill

5
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:12,985
Peach Snapple
into a helium neon laser.

6
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:17,639
Short answer is... don't.

7
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:25,080
And now to tell you
about the theoretical physics department

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,613
is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

9
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:33,011
Forget it.

10
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:36,217
Excuse me.

11
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:40,376
- Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
- It's a waste of time.

12
00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:42,498
I might as well explain
the laws of thermodynamics

13
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:44,329
to a bunch of labradoodles.

14
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:47,348
If you don't do this,

15
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:49,659
I won't take you
to the comic book store.

16
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,921
Nice work with the laser,
by the way.

17
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:06,356
Looking out
at your fresh young faces,

18
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:09,916
I remember when I too was
deciding my academic future

19
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,765
as a lowly graduate student.

20
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:14,443
Of course, I was 14.

21
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:18,217
And I'd already achieved more
than most of you could ever hope to,

22
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:19,943
despite my 9:00 bedtime.

23
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:24,803
Now, there may be one or two
of you in this room

24
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:28,354
who has what it takes to succeed
in theoretical physics.

25
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:29,975
It's more likely that you'll spend

26
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:32,046
your scientific careers teaching
5th graders

27
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,889
how to make papier mache
volcanoes with baking soda lava.

28
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:39,227
- Good God.
- In short...

29
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,020
any one who told you
that you would someday be able

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,082
to make any significant
contribution to physics,

31
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:47,023
played a cruel trick on you,
a cruel trick indeed.

32
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:51,156
Any questions?

33
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:55,508
Of course not.

34
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,435
I weep for the future of science.

35
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:02,417
Now if you'll excuse me,
the latest issue of <i>Batman</i> is out.

36
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:04,556
Come, Leonard.

37
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,903
Laser demonstration's looking
pretty good now, huh?

38
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:34,377
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

39
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:38,465
I love this time
of the year.

40
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:41,122
The leaves are turning,
there's a bracing chill in the air.

41
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:44,022
Plus there's a whole new crop
of female grad students

42
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:46,200
about to put on just enough
winter weight

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,004
to make them needy
and vulnerable.

44
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,547
That's right, honey,
have another calzone.

45
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:53,839
Daddy can wait.

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,349
Isn't there a university policy
against dating graduate students?

47
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:01,948
No, if you can talk to them,
you can ask them out.

48
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:03,520
Damn, there's always a catch.

49
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,626
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Leslie.

50
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:10,318
So, dumbass, I heard you made
a grad student throw up last night.

51
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:13,676
The truth can indeed
be a finger down the throat

52
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:15,764
of those unprepared to hear it.

53
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:19,279
But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

54
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,948
Because first-rate minds
call you "dumbass"?

55
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,907
Oh, yeah? Well...

56
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,053
you're a mean person.

57
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,301
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper,

58
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,758
I'm Ramona Nowitzki.
I was at your talk last night.

59
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,885
I think you're just brilliant.

60
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,025
That is the prevailing opinion.

61
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:40,673
Now I'm gonna
throw up.

62
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:44,102
Howard Wolowitz,
department of engineering,

63
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:46,210
co-designer of the
International Space Station's

64
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,130
Liquid Waste Disposal System.

65
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:58,157
I've read
everything you've published.

66
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,648
I liked your paper on grand unification
using string-network condensates

67
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:04,402
and was wondering how you determined
that 3-dimensional string-nets

68
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:07,233
provided a unified picture of ferrnions
and gauge bosons?

69
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:10,636
Amazing,
an intelligent labradoodle.

70
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:18,242
The fact is I'm quite
close to a breakthrough

71
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:21,139
in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string-net condensate.

72
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,309
My God, that would change the way
we view the entire physical universe.

73
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,130
It's what I do.

74
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:30,773
You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz
Liquid Waste Disposal System

75
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:32,980
is turning a few heads as well.

76
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:38,509
Again, ew.

77
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,412
I'd love to hear more
about how you intend to add neutrinos.

78
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,817
Could we get
a cup of coffee sometime?

79
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:48,124
I don't drink coffee.

80
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:50,251
I do. I love me a cup of joe.

81
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:53,286
It doesn't have to be coffee.
How about dinner?

82
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:54,714
- I do eat dinner.
- Great.

83
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:57,983
- I know a terrific Italian place.
- I never eat in strange restaurants.

84
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,595
One runs the risk
of non-standard cutlery.

85
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:02,761
Excuse me?

86
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,549
Sheldon lives in fear
of the three-tined fork.

87
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:08,528
Three tines is not a fork.

88
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,195
Three tines is a trident.

89
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:13,584
Forks are for eating,
tridents are for ruling the seven seas.

90
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:17,648
What if I brought food
to your place?

91
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:19,193
That would be acceptable.

92
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:20,793
On Mondays, I eat Thai food.

93
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:22,245
Mee krob and chicken sate

94
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,494
with extra peanut sauce
from Siam Palace.

95
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:25,814
You got it.

96
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,664
I already have your address.

97
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:32,493
What a nice girl.

98
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:36,505
Do you have any idea
what just happened?

99
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:39,624
Yes. Apparently I'm getting
a free dinner.

100
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,328
Oh, yeah, no, this thing's
majorly out of order.

101
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,383
- See? Sorry.
- That's okay.

102
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:51,934
Guess I'm taking the stairs.

103
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:53,699
- Where you going?
- 4- A.

104
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:56,482
- You here to see Leonard?
- No, Dr. Cooper.

105
00:05:57,311 --> 00:05:58,891
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

106
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,010
We're having dinner.

107
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:03,935
Sheldon Cooper?

108
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,513
Tall, thin,

109
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,129
looks a little like
a giant praying mantis?

110
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:14,119
He is cute, isn't he?

111
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,483
- Hi, Leonard.
- Hey, Ramona. Come on in.

112
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:27,615
- Thanks. Where should I put this?
- The kitchen's fine.

113
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:31,095
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I need to see this.

114
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:35,310
The viewing area's right over there.

115
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:40,906
Sheldon, your girl... date... person...
Ramona's here.

116
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,794
- Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.

117
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:47,629
I just got so caught up reading
the draft of your latest paper.

118
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:50,882
Did you enjoy the humorous footnote
where I illustrate mirror-symmetry

119
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:53,302
by likening it to the Flash
playing tennis with himself?

120
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:54,438
So funny.

121
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:58,474
But the idea that you might be able
to incorporate gravity,

122
00:06:58,594 --> 00:07:01,602
I have to tell you,
I found it physically exhilarating.

123
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:06,637
My hypotheses tend
to have that effect.

124
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,966
I'm sorry I didn't bring enough
for your friends.

125
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:13,233
I assumed we were going to be alone.

126
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:18,884
No, we were just going.

127
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,368
To watch, right?

128
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:24,197
No, come on, now,
we're going out.

129
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:25,977
Come on, we'll be quiet.

130
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,513
Let's go.

131
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,366
Okay, you two.

132
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,405
Have a nice...

133
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:35,237
whatever this is.

134
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,831
Okay, you guys, look,
I know this is none of my business,

135
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:43,747
but I just... I have to ask.

136
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,760
What's Sheldon's deal?

137
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:52,507
- What do you mean "deal"?
- You know, like what's his deal?

138
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,167
Is it girls...? Guys...?
Sock puppets...?

139
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,808
Honestly, we've been operating
under the assumption

140
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:00,414
that he has no deal.

141
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,944
Come on, everybody has a deal.

142
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:04,067
Not Sheldon.

143
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:06,275
Over the years,
we've formulated many theories

144
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:08,228
about how he might reproduce.

145
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:11,482
I'm an advocate of mitosis.

146
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:14,644
I'm sorry?

147
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:18,702
I believe one day Sheldon will eat
an enormous amount of Thai food

148
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:20,574
and split into two Sheldons.

149
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:26,558
On the other hand, I think Sheldon
might be the larval form of his species,

150
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:29,060
and someday he'll spin a cocoon
and emerge two months later

151
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,052
with moth wings and an exoskeleton.

152
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:35,003
Okay, well, thanks
for the nightmares.

153
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,105
Hey, do you want to
hang out with us?

154
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:41,584
What are you guys gonna do?

155
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:45,888
My mom's making a brisket tonight.

156
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,343
The one with the little onions?

157
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:54,760
Yeah, I'm busy, so...

158
00:08:56,378 --> 00:08:57,378
Good night.

159
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,073
Her loss. Let's go.

160
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,709
Brisket party!

161
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,581
B- to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K...

162
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,653
To-the-E-to-the-T...

163
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,800
Don't.

164
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,351
Aren't you having breakfast?

165
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:18,629
Yes.

166
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:23,524
Are you experimenting with
nutritional suppositories again?

167
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,879
Not in these pants.

168
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:31,073
So... how'd it go
with Ramona last night?

169
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:34,887
Great.
She's smart, insightful

170
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,065
and she has a very unique way
of, you know, revering me.

171
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:43,352
Here's your spinach mushroom omelet.

172
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:45,363
Thank you.

173
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,154
- Did anyone touch it?
- Gloves were worn by everyone involved.

174
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:50,509
I was vigilant.

175
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:54,620
Ramona pointed out
that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day

176
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,309
- standing on cafeteria lines.
- Time which would be better spent

177
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,465
tackling the great physics
problems of our day.

178
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:02,730
You don't tackle the big issues.
You fence with them.

179
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,428
En garde. Riposte.

180
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,510
Touche.

181
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:13,977
- Morning.
- Hey, Lesly.

182
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:16,218
So I see you're organizing
your papers

183
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:18,719
for the Smithsonian Museum
of Dumbassery.

184
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:22,354
There won't be any room
until they get rid

185
00:10:22,474 --> 00:10:24,456
of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.

186
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,539
Good one.

187
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,359
I see you got a grad student
to fight your battles for you.

188
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:33,431
I'll let you keep
your lunch money today.

189
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,039
Dr. Cooper is on the verge
of a breakthrough.

190
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:40,643
If you're going to stay,
you'll have to be respectful and quiet.

191
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:49,976
Wait for me.

192
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:56,075
Have you worked out
the neutrino issue?

193
00:10:56,702 --> 00:11:00,211
Well, to paraphrase Mozart,
all the subatomic particles are there.

194
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:02,110
I just have to put them
in the right order.

195
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,249
You're so witty.

196
00:11:04,218 --> 00:11:05,167
Aren't I?

197
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:12,216
Hey, guys,
this package came for...

198
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,157
Dr. Cooper is working.

199
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,882
Yes, I'm close to a breakthrough.

200
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:21,390
It tickles!

201
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:24,597
Sorry.

202
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,412
Holy crap on a cracker.

203
00:11:34,482 --> 00:11:36,574
You probably don't want
to go in there.

204
00:11:36,955 --> 00:11:38,394
Why? What are they doing?

205
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:43,163
The only way I could explain it would be
in a therapist's office with dolls.

206
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:53,922
Boy.

207
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:57,178
Dr. Cooper's working.

208
00:11:57,537 --> 00:11:59,025
Yeah, I can see that.

209
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:02,600
Sheldon, <i>Halo </i>night, Koothrappali's.
You coming?

210
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,387
Yes, it's <i>Halo </i>night.

211
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,169
Let me just dry my tootsies.

212
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:10,310
- You're not going to <i>Halo </i>night.
- Yes, I am.

213
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,492
It's Wednesday.
Wednesday's <i>Halo </i>night.

214
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:16,851
Didn't a great man once say,
"Science demands nothing less

215
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,994
"than the fervent and
unconditional dedication

216
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,393
"of our entire lives"?

217
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,829
- He did.
- And who was that great man?

218
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:25,729
Me.

219
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:30,711
- Sorry, Leonard.
- Seriously? You're not coming?

220
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:33,175
You heard her.
How can I argue with me?

221
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:38,164
Okay, well, once again,
you guys have a good...

222
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:40,485
whatever this is.

223
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:47,019
Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you
your friends are holding you back.

224
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:50,289
I prefer to think of it
as "I'm pulling them forward."

225
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,858
<i>Halo</i> night?

226
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:54,742
A man with your intellectual gifts

227
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:57,113
doesn't waste an evening
playing video games.

228
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:59,129
He does on Wednesdays.

229
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,934
Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.

230
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,039
He does want that.

231
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:09,842
Does a man with my intellectual gifts
play paintball on weekends?

232
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,817
- What do you think?
- Drat.

233
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,162
- Now shall we get back to work?
- I suppose.

234
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:23,931
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>
comes on tonight.

235
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,976
I guess I can wait for the DVD.

236
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,706
And then, never ever watch it.

237
00:14:33,913 --> 00:14:36,449
Sheldon, honey, I've told you,
it's a small apartment.

238
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:38,130
You only have to knock one time.

239
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,610
I don't have a lot of time.

240
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,094
Ramona finally dozed off,

241
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,236
and I need you to help me
get rid of her.

242
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:47,403
Get rid of her how?

243
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,183
I don't know,

244
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,999
but apparently
I'm in some kind of relationship,

245
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,147
and you seem to be an expert
at ending them.

246
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,236
Excuse me?

247
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:03,822
I see man after man
leaving this apartment never to return.

248
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:07,694
Okay, first of all,
it is not man after man.

249
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:09,884
Hide me.

250
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,992
- Hide you?
- I formally request sanctuary.

251
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:17,444
Why aren't you working?

252
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:20,881
She distracted me.

253
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:24,868
I told you, Penny,
I don't have time for your nonsense.

254
00:15:24,988 --> 00:15:26,871
I have important things to do.

255
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:30,591
Oh, man.

256
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,141
- I know what's going on here.
- Really?

257
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:34,864
Then will you explain it to me?

258
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,773
You're in love with Dr. Cooper.

259
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:40,894
Yeah, no, that's not it.

260
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:43,592
Don't try to deny it.

261
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,155
He's a remarkable man,

262
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:47,500
but you have to let him go.

263
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,470
Gee, okay.

264
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:53,774
I know it's hard,
but he's a gift to the whole world,

265
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:55,332
and we can't be selfish.

266
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,044
Yeah, he's a gift all right.

267
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,325
Sisters?

268
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:05,074
Sure.

269
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:06,194
Sisters.

270
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:13,210
Holy crap on a cracker.

271
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:30,724
What are you doing?!

272
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:32,351
It's Morse code.

273
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:35,581
Why?

274
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:37,991
So we can communicate
through the wall.

275
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:42,049
We are communicating
through the wall.

276
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,049
Yes, but the communication
is not encrypted.

277
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:48,055
I don't know Morse code.

278
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:50,052
It's very simple. This is A...

279
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:51,699
This is B...

280
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,595
- This is C.
- I'm not going to learn Morse code

281
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:56,042
at 3:00 in the morning!

282
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:57,162
All right.

283
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:01,106
Don't come in here,
don't come in here...

284
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:07,554
What's going on?

285
00:17:07,674 --> 00:17:09,490
Ramona's sleeping on the couch.

286
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,450
I know.
When is she going home?

287
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:13,216
Never. That's the problem.

288
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,914
- I need your help.
- What are you talking about?

289
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:20,478
I'm invoking the Skynet clause
of our friendship agreement.

290
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,675
That only applies if you need me

291
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:25,015
to help you destroy
an artificial intelligence

292
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:27,508
you've created that's taking
over the Earth.

293
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:29,216
Come on! Don't nitpick!

294
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:32,156
Good night.

295
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:33,703
All right.

296
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:37,450
I'm invoking
our Body Snatchers clause.

297
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,195
The Body Snatchers clause requires me
to help you destroy

298
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:43,909
someone we know
who's been replaced with an alien pod.

299
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:46,379
She's in the living room.
Go. I'll wait here.

300
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,321
Sheldon,
what are you doing out of bed?

301
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:50,654
Now! Do it!

302
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:56,846
You know you need your sleep
in order for your cognitive processing

303
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:58,908
to perform at optimum levels.
Now come on.

304
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:00,257
Godzilla clause?

305
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:03,012
Not unless she destroys Tokyo.

306
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:05,246
Rats.

307
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:08,432
I've got it!

308
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:11,593
I finally reconciled
the black hole information paradox

309
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:13,929
with my theory
of string-network condensates!

310
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,349
It's unbelievable!
It's paradigm-altering.

311
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,184
I could not have done it
without you.

312
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:21,353
Please, I just offered
a little encouragement.

313
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:23,063
It was a lot more than that.

314
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:25,444
You helped me work out
the masses of all the fermions

315
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,192
and you pumiced my hammer toe.

316
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:30,529
How can I ever repay you?

317
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,092
Would you consider naming it
the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?

318
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:35,442
Who's Nowitzki?

319
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:38,620
I'm Nowitzki.

320
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:40,956
You want me to share credit?

321
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:43,949
Get out!

322
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:48,749
Bite me!

323
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:52,642
Sisters?

324
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:58,682
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper.

325
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,835
I'm Kathy O'Brien.
I just finished reading your paper

326
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:04,117
reconciling the black hole
information paradox

327
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:06,371
with your theory
of string-network condensates,

328
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:08,150
and it just took my breath away.

329
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,512
Maybe when I publish it,
I'll include an inhaler.

330
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,952
Would you possibly have any time
for me to pick your brain?

331
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:21,261
Let's see. Today's Thursday.

332
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:23,230
Thursday nights, I eat pizza
from Giacomo's.

333
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,958
Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.

334
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:27,121
Great.
I'll bring it to your place.

335
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:28,545
I have the address.

336
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:33,592
What a nice girl.

337
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:37,930
Sheldon, do you see
what just happened here?

338
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:40,455
Yes, I'm getting a free pizza.

339
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:44,848
I'm on a roll.

340
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:52,069
More pad Thai, please.

341
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,404
Sheldon, you've already had
four servings.

342
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:56,273
You might want
to slow down a bit.

343
00:19:57,574 --> 00:19:59,260
Just one more bite.

344
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:09,795
Are you okay?

345
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm just so...

346
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:12,817
full.

347
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,125
That's it. No more Thai food.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
