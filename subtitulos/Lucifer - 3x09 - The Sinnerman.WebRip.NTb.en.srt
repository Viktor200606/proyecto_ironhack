[SIGHS]

179
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:34,363
Maybe my Father wanted me
to be a better emissary,

180
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:36,558
someone who could fix things on Earth

181
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,933
and stay invisible.

182
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:41,636
So, I can slow down
time and do His bidding

183
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,606
without anyone being the wiser.

184
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:46,776
That seems really...

185
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:48,244
sad.

186
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:49,879
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

187
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:52,314
it... it just seems lonely

188
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:56,986
to visit humanity without ever
really getting to know anyone.

189
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:01,223
I guess I was never told
to <i>avoid</i> humanity.

190
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,127
It just seemed easier.

191
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:09,298
And quite honestly,
I never saw the point.

192
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,827
Until recently.

193
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:16,038
Hey, stranger...

00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:19,208
- You're back!
- Yeah!

196
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,918
Oh, I missed you, too, girl.

197
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:23,747
Where was your bounty
this time, Mazikeen?

198
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,916
Uh, Cleveland.

203
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:32,955
Okay. Well, Linda...

204
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:36,025
Linda was just catching
me up on how sh...

205
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:39,662
[LAUGHS]: on how she
believed in "angel school."

Yes. Yeah, we... we've been hanging out.

00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,804
Yeah, we're friends.

ELLA: It's not just <i>any</i> shoe.

213
00:08:57,548 --> 00:08:59,749
Joey's high-tops were limited edition.

214
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:01,870
Easily worth a grand a pair.

215
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,940
I mean, my brothers
would flip over these.

216
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,287

What are you doing here?

220
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,960
Little early for opposing counsel.

221
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:12,104
Are you defending someone?

222
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:13,195
CHARLOTTE: No.

223
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:14,698
I quit my job.

224
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:17,057
Oh. Well, good for you, Charlotte.

00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:19,735
as a corrupt defense lawyer, have you?

227
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:21,504
That'll help keep your ledger clear.

228
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:24,479
Today is my first day in the
district attorney's office...

229
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,574
As a prosecutor.

230
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:26,876
I'm on your side now.

231
00:09:26,878 --> 00:09:28,577
- Surprise.
- [CHUCKLES]

232
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:29,745
Did you know about this?

233
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:30,746
Not a clue.

234
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:31,747
How did this happen?

235
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:33,956
Who knows how these things happen?

236
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,084
So random.

237
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,346
Guess we should get
back to the case, right?

238
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:39,855
- Right.
- Right.

239
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:42,558
So, Joey had expensive shoes,

240
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,893
plus...

241
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,776
a real Rolex

242
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,398
and ten grand stashed under his bed.

243
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,566
But Joey worked for the mob.

244
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:52,201
I mean, wouldn't that
explain all the swag?

245
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:54,170
Runners for the mob don't
make that kind of money.

246
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:55,838
There's no way he could afford that.

247
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,340
Maybe Joey was skimming off the top.

248
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:01,010
No, you don't have to raise your hand.

249
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:03,712
Okay, well, um, his
bosses wouldn't like that.

250
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:05,176
They would execute Joey

251
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:07,245
to send a message to
the whole organization.

252
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:09,409
Whoever brought him
in would do the deed.

253
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:10,719
Lovely.

254
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:12,904
What? I know how these guys work.

255
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:15,174
I've represented mobsters
like this for years.

an audience when I ream Frankie

00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:00,001

You were supposed to
mentor Joey Pileggi,

not kill him.

317
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:41,603

had a real bright future.

She died from two gunshots to the chest.

Detective, I wasn't
entirely forthcoming earlier.

The real reason I started
granting favors again

396
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:50,642
