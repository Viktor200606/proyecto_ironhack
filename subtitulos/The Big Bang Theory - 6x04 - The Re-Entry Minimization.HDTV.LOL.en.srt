1
00:00:02,425 --> 00:00:04,242
Howard's capsule
should be reentering

2
00:00:04,244 --> 00:00:05,994
the atmosphere
any minute.

3
00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:07,429
It'll be good to have him back.

4
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:10,132
The Fantastic Four reunited!
(chuckles)

5
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:14,336
Yeah, you had a good
run, Fake Wolowitz.

6
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:17,773
We'll remember you
with nostalgic fondness.

7
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:22,427
The way we do the dial-up modem,
the VHS tape, or...

8
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,479
or Leonard's gym membership.

9
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:27,199
We're not kicking him out.

10
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,984
Stuart and I have
become good friends.

11
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:31,153
Okay, one vote for,
one vote against.

12
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:33,271
Leonard, you're
the tiebreaker.

13
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:34,990
I don't have a problem
with Stuart.

14
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,958
Besides, he gives us
a 20% discount

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,210
at his comic book store.

16
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,445
Well, I don't sell my
friendship that cheaply.

17
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:41,747
I can go 30.

18
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,582
Welcome aboard,
old chum.

19
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:46,951
Okay, the NASA Web site says

20
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:49,454
Howard's final
descent has begun.

21
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:52,174
(sighs)
He left a boy,

22
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:56,061
he returns a boy-sized hero.

23
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:58,930
(Wolowitz screaming)
(loud rumbling)

24
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:01,566

We survived!

That was just
the parachute.

48
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:09,318
Waiting for my husband.

49
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,820
That's nice.

50
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:13,439
He's coming back
from outer space.

51
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:17,326
I think this flight's
coming from Houston.

52
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:20,496
No, I mean, he...

53
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:21,997
Never mind.

54
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,334
BERNADETTE:
There he is! Howie!

55
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:28,621
(reporters shouting "Howie!")

56
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:30,989
Howie!

57
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,475
Whoa, thank you.

58
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:34,627
Great to be
back on Earth.

59
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,347
Uh, I think they're
here for me, Ringo.

60
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,183
Howie!
Howie!

61
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:42,551
Mr. Mandel, I'm your driver.

62
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:44,303
Oh, thanks.

63
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:45,438
Here you go.

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,107
That nut job was telling
everybody on the plane

65
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:50,059
he's an astronaut.

66
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:52,228
I missed you so much!

67
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:56,148
(laughs)
I missed you, too.

68
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:59,652
(chuckle)
Oh...

69
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:00,903
Where are the guys?

70
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,187
Oh, it's just me.

71
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:03,522
Oh, I get it.

72
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:06,358
They're waiting back home
with a big surprise party.

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,160
Don't worry, I can
act surprised.

74
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:09,662
(gasps)

75
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:14,216
No, I told them they could
have you tomorrow night.

76
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:16,418
Tonight, you belong to me.

77
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,221
(loud sneeze)

78
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:20,840
(groans)

79
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:22,007
(giggles)

80
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,059
Gesundheit.
You okay?

81
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:26,211
I am now that you're back.

82
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:27,580
Come on, let's go home

83
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,732
so I can tear off
those little pants.

84
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:30,988
Great. Just keep in mind

85
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:33,698
astronauts lose a lot of
muscle tone in space,

86
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:37,383
so you might have to do
most of the heavy lifting. (laughs)

87
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:40,493
You know, I am
very disappointed

88
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,444
that I won't be able
to celebrate

89
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:44,330
Howard's accomplishment tonight.

90
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:46,081
Me, too.
But we'll see him tomorrow.

91
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,834
Yes, it's just that
in all the years I've known him,

92
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:53,088
he's never had the opportunity
to receive my admiration.

93
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:56,091
I was excited to see
the look on his face

94
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,459
when it finally happened.

95
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,645
You're unbelievable.

96
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:01,463
I know.

97
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:02,915
LEONARD:
All right,

98
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,450
Pictionary-- what are the teams?

99
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,885
How about
boys versus girls?

100
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:06,919
Oh!

101
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:08,103
That hardly seems fair.

102
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:10,773
But I guess
any team that I'm not on

103
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,558
has a decided disadvantage.

104
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:15,895
Once again, unbelievable.
Yeah,

105
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:18,364
once again, I know.

106
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:21,367
All right, round one.

107
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,334
Here.

108
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:24,370
Got it.
Okay.

109
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,088
Ready, set,

110
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,790
go.

111
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:30,209
Uh, box?

112
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:31,710
Uh,

113
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:33,111
window?

114
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:35,414
Batman.

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,218
LEONARD:
Batman and Robin.

116
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:43,422
Uh, Wonder Twins
plus the monkey.

117
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,459
Wonder Twins plus
the monkey <i>and</i> Batman.

118
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:50,462
A gift? Present!

119
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,647
Present! Yeah!

120
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:54,250
Oh...
Leonard.

121
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,936
Now, how can you not get that?

122
00:04:56,938 --> 00:05:00,990
In what universe
is that a present?

123
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:02,458
It's not <i>a</i> present,

124
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,577
it's <i>the</i> present. Look.

125
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,278
There's you and me.

126
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,813
It's Penny and Amy.

127
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:10,249
We're playing Pictionary.

128
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:12,551
In the present.

129
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:19,592
Oh, my God, we're
gonna kill them.

130
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:24,096
It's a quark-gluon plasma.

131
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:25,948
No.

132
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,883
It's asymptotically free partons

133
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:30,502
inside a quark-gluon plasma.

134
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,972
Nothing with quarks.

135
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:34,773
It's an observational rebuttal

136
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:37,476
of the Lambda-CDM model
of the universe!

137
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:39,628
No!

138
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,729
It's a chocolate chip cookie!

139
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,982
Yes!

140
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,852
How could you miss that?

141
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:50,122
Hey, if you want someone to
guess "chocolate chip cookie,"

142
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:52,608
you draw a glass of milk
next to it.

143
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,193
Penny got it.
Yeah, only after

144
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:57,746
I eliminated
all the <i>obvious</i> answers.

145
00:05:58,698 --> 00:06:00,015
You're welcome.

146
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:05,454
LEONARD:
Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage.

147
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:07,423
Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst?

148
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,142
Oh, oh, a hot dog.

149
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:12,761
Penny, aren't you gonna
draw something?

150
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:17,132
(chuckles): Relax, we got time,
this is so fun.

151
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:20,052
There.

152
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:21,403
A solar system.

153
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:22,721
Uh, uh, uh,

154
00:06:22,723 --> 00:06:26,692
uh, um, unidentified
flying liverwurst? I don't...

155
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:30,029
Now?

156
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:31,897
Soon.

157
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,699
Come on, Leonard,

158
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:36,368
I am spoon-feeding this to you.

159
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:44,243
I don't know,

160
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:45,477
uh...

161
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,180
Casper the <i>alcoholic</i> ghost?

162
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,517
All right,
that's enough.

163
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,768
(clears throat)

164
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:55,949
AMY:
Uh, hand.

165
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,333
Uh, nail...
polish?

166
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:58,842
Yep!

167
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:01,093
SHELDON:
Wait, no, no!

168
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:02,978
No!

169
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,263
The word is "Polish."

170
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:07,432
See, look.
Polish sausage.

171
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:10,069
And the-the model
of the solar system developed

172
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,621
by Nicolaus Copernicus,
a <i>Polish</i> astronomer.

173
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:14,206
And then, finally,

174
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,741
if that wasn't enough--
which it should've been--

175
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:18,160
this is Madame Curie
killing herself

176
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,245
by discovering radium, who,

177
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,280
although she was
a naturalized French citizen,

178
00:07:22,282 --> 00:07:25,217
was <i>Polish</i> by birth!

179
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,639
Excuse me,
the word is "polish."

180
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:32,591
See? Small "P."

181
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,228
Ah!

182
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,648
So it is.

183
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,734
I guess we both
share blame on this one.

184
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:47,072
Bernie, you okay?

185
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:48,607
Yeah, I'll be
right there.

186
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:51,393
(hacks, coughs, spits)

187
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:59,651
Did you get a sea lion
while I was gone?

188
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:02,154
It's just allergies.

189
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:04,289
Okay. (chuckles)

190
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,175
(congested): Took some Benadryl.
I'll be fine.

191
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:07,876
(chuckles)

192
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:08,927
So...

193
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:10,179
did you miss me?

194
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:12,147
Oh.

195
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,166
Are you kidding?
Every minute of every...

196
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,351
(phlegmy hacking)

197
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:20,338
(groans)
Ew.

198
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:26,945
Excuse me.

199
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:29,648
Sweetie, we don't have
to do this now.

200
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,284
Yes, we do.

201
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,286
(awkward chuckle)

202
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:39,524
You left right after
we got married.

203
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:40,459
(chuckles)

204
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:43,862
This is like
our honeymoon.

205
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:47,532
(chuckles)
Now,

206
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,751
hold on to your hat.

207
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:52,254
Oh.

208
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:53,672
Uh-oh.

209
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:54,840
You okay?

210
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:56,258
A little dizzy.

211
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,876
Must be the Benadryl.

212
00:08:57,878 --> 00:09:00,813
(chuckles)
Switch places with me.

213
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,981
Okay. (chuckles)

214
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:05,267
(exhales)

215
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:06,985
Now...

216
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:13,158
...kiss me!

217
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:21,867
(quiet snoring)

218
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:24,569
Bernadette?

219
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:27,623
(continues snoring)

220
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,908
Bernie?
Bernie?

221
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,376
(gasps)

222
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:33,679
That was amazing.

223
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,435
You made me feel things
I never...

224
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:49,444
Well, that was quick
and a little gross.

225
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:53,765
Now, I know how <i>she</i> feels.

226
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:57,569
Hey, Sheldon, you're always

227
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,437
full of fun little facts.

228
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:00,539
Where did the expression

229
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,859
"got your ass handed to you"
come from?

230
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:08,864
Don't know.

231
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:12,301
I wonder if it's from,
like, ancient Rome

232
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:13,785
where they'd actually
chop somebody's ass off

233
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:16,788
and then go, "Here."

234
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:22,010
You know, to appease
Loseroneous, the god of losers.

235
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:24,546
I am not a loser.

236
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:28,466
Pictionary is not a true test of
any real intelligence or skill.

237
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:30,185
Mmm, in all
fairness,

238
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:33,322
Pictionary has verbal
skills, visual skills.

239
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:34,773
It's a pretty well-rounded game.

240
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,191
Lot of big talk
from a man

241
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:37,859
who can't draw
a chocolate chip cookie.

242
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:40,462
All right, fine,
pick another game.

243
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:42,447
Amy and I will beat
you at anything.

244
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:43,916
All right.

245
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:45,650
Let's play...

246
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:48,570
Physics Fiesta.

247
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:50,756
Oh, come on, what is that?

248
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:52,457
It's a game
that I just invented,

249
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,093
in which the participants
answer physics questions

250
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:56,929
in remedial Spanish.

251
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:58,496
Um...

252
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:01,433
¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?

253
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:04,486
En el acelerador
<i>de particulares.</i>

254
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,523
<i>Bueno, mi amigo.</i>

255
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,062
No, no, we're not playing
some dumb made-up game.

256
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:16,014
All games
are made up.

257
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:17,616
They're not found in nature.

258
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:19,618
You don't just dig in
the ground, come across

259
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,654
a rich vein
of Rock'em Sock'em Robots.

260
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:24,906
Just pick
another game.

261
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:26,325
Why don't we do
something athletic

262
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:29,161
like go over to the university
pool and play water polo?

263
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:32,264
No good--
Sheldon doesn't float.

264
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,749
That is true.

265
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:36,134
I have a higher than
normal body density.

266
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:39,254
If I run too deep a bath,
I drown.

267
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:41,039
All right,
let's keep it simple.

268
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,007
How about darts?

269
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,642
Oh, that's not fair either.

270
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:44,676
Why not?

271
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:46,228
Darts is a bar game.

272
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,263
You've been frequenting
drinking establishments

273
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:50,449
since you were of legal age.

274
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:53,769
Yeah, that's
when it started.

275
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:56,071
Well, regardless, she
has a distinct advantage

276
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:57,555
in all tavern-
based competitions.

277
00:11:57,557 --> 00:12:02,160
Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt
contests-- they're all out.

278
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:03,528
PENNY:
Okay.

279
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,831
Just for the record,
I have never entered

280
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,399
a wet T-shirt contest.

281
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:10,002
I've won a few, but that's just
because I spill when I'm drunk,

282
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:12,504
so...

283
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,456
We could go
to the cadaver lab at UCLA

284
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,293
and play real-life Operation.

285
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:21,179
Uh-uh.  No.
I don't think so.

286
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:23,048
Are you sure? I mean,
the nose doesn't light up,

287
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,282
but if the corpse
is fresh enough,

288
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:27,719
sometimes you can get
the leg to jerk.

289
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:34,643
Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle,
your little star is home!

290
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:38,814
Ma, the chain's on the door!

291
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:40,198
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard?

292
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,668
I thought I wasn't going
to see you till tomorrow!

293
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,154
Yeah, well,
Bernie's not feeling well,

294
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:47,823
so I thought I'd stop by,

295
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:50,792
tell you about the greatest
adventure of my life,

296
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:54,212
see if you can make me feel bad
about it.

297
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:58,900
Uh, uh, okay, hold
on, I'm not decent!

298
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:00,802
All right.

299
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:02,721
Woman hasn't tied her robe
in 20 years.

300
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:04,122
Suddenly she's not decent?

301
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:08,727
MAN: You want me to hide in the
closet or go out the back?!

302
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:12,714
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Shh, you need to whisper.

303
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:14,466
Ma, who is in there?

304
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:15,634
Uh, nobody!

305
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:17,853
The TV is on!

306
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:19,071
MAN:
I only got one sock.

307
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:21,873
Where's my
other sock?

308
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:22,974
Who is that?

309
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,409
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I told you, it's the TV.

310
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:28,947
Jay Leno lost a sock;
it's hilarious.

311
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,649
If you're busy, I can come back.

312
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:33,201
Just give me
a second!

313
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,420
Go, go, go, go.

314
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:39,824
(window opens)

315
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:46,381
Dr. Schneider?

316
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:49,184
Oh, hello, Howard.

317
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:52,204
What are you doing here?

318
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,474
Um, house call.

319
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:57,642
You're a dentist.

320
00:13:58,945 --> 00:14:01,196
Yes, yes, I am.

321
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:03,782
I think he's
on to us!

322
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:13,624
Okay, glasses off.

323
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,910
Find Waldo.

324
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,201
Hurry up,
find him, find him.

325
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:25,036
I'm trying!
Don't yell at me!

326
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:26,170
For goodness' sake,
he's wearing

327
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:28,873
a hat, glasses,
and a red striped shirt.

328
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,074
I know what he looks like.

329
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:31,476
Oh, there he
is, I got him.

330
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:34,295
Yes, we
win again!

331
00:14:34,297 --> 00:14:36,130
How could you not find him?

332
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:38,566
Because he's hard to find.

333
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:39,684
If he was easy to find,

334
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:42,720
the books would be called
<i>There's Waldo.</i>

335
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:49,009
57, 58, 59,
that's one minute.

336
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:51,195
(sputters)

337
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:54,265
Long division,
long division.

338
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:55,867
Go, go, go.

339
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:58,185
Remember,
show your work.

340
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,705
I'm okay.

341
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:02,874
I'm okay.

342
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:04,826
(thuds)

343
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:07,695
I'm not okay.

344
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:10,865
Get up, we can't lose in math.

345
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,333
37!
Yes!

346
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:14,285
Aah!

347
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:16,370
Ready, set, wrestle.

348
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:18,055
(screams)

349
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:20,341
One, two, three, pin.

350
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:21,559
Mwah!

351
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:24,395
Stop that.

352
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:25,396
Mwah!

353
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:26,397
Amy, do something.

354
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,398
Mwah.

355
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,900
Amy, help.

356
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:31,319
W-- Amy, stop that.

357
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,938
Amy, Penny,
both of you, stop it.

358
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:39,577
One to beam aboard?

359
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:41,579
Oh, my God, you're back.

360
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:42,663
(laughs)

361
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:43,731
Oh, look at you.

362
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,666
You, you look
like you grew.

363
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:48,503
(chuckling):
Yeah.

364
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:50,838
The lack of gravity
did decompress my spine,

365
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,207
so I'm like
an inch and a half taller.

366
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,259
I'm going to the DMV tomorrow
to get my license changed

367
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:56,911
before I shrink back.

368
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:59,463
Oh, uh, come in, come in.

369
00:15:59,465 --> 00:16:01,516
Oh, I, uh, I didn't think
I was going to get

370
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:02,733
to see you until tomorrow.

371
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:05,136
Yeah, well,
Bernadette's a little

372
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,270
under the weather

373
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:10,441
and my mom's
kind of under my dentist.

374
00:16:10,443 --> 00:16:13,761
Wait, your, your mother
is sleeping with your dentist?

375
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:15,062
Former dentist.

376
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:17,865
I need a new one now that I know
where his hands have been.

377
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:21,819
So you're wandering
all around by yourself?

378
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:23,404
That's not the kind
of hero's welcome

379
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:25,122
an astronaut should
come home to.

380
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,742
It's okay, you know,
we space cowboys

381
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:31,295
don't do what we do
for glory and fame.

382
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:35,166
We leave that to your rock stars
and your athletes

383
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:38,302
and your Howie Mandels.

384
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:42,924
Oh, hey, man, welcome back.

385
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,792
Oh, Stuart, thanks.

386
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,277
What are you doing here?

387
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,128
I, I kind of live here now.

388
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,697
Just until he gets
back on his feet,

389
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:51,015
which are looking pretty good

390
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:53,901
in the boots I bought him
for his birthday.

391
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:55,937
(imitates explosion)

392
00:16:56,939 --> 00:17:00,191
Ah, he's spoiling
me and I love it.

393
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:05,496
Wow, so you guys
are like buds now?

394
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:07,298
Oh, yeah, we hang out
all the time.

395
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,566
Plus, he doesn't
have a girlfriend,

396
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:09,750
I don't have
a girlfriend.

397
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,118
It's like we both had
these holes

398
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,006
in our lives, but now we fill
each other's holes.

399
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,329
Uh...

400
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:25,533
that sounds a little
funny to an American ear.

401
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:26,834
Which part?

402
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:29,670
Just all of it.

403
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:31,171
Okay,

404
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:33,691
so w-what do you guys
got going on tonight?

405
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:37,078
Raj is taking me to the
<i>Sound of Music</i> sing-along.

406
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,030
<i>Sound of Music</i> sing-along?

407
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:41,449
That used to be our thing,
but that's cool.

408
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,734
Oh, Howard,
it's still our thing.

409
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:45,803
Come with us, we'll, we'll
get you a scalped ticket.

410
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:48,673
So I'd be sitting by myself?

411
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:49,790
We'll switch.

412
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,592
You'll come sit with me
after intermission.

413
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:55,212
So I-I-I'd be sitting by myself
during "Edelweiss"?

414
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:56,847
No, no,

415
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,182
you guys go.

416
00:17:58,184 --> 00:17:59,784
Have fun.

417
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:01,385
Okay, uh, will I get
to see you tomorrow?

418
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:02,219
Absolutely.

419
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:03,370
See you, Stuart.

420
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:05,723
Yeah, yeah.

421
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:08,709
Is he taller?

422
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,815
At least my mother made <i>her</i>
boyfriend climb out the window.

423
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:21,388
All right, standard state fair
pie-eating contest rules are:

424
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,325
no hands, first one
to clean the pan wins.

425
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:25,493
(both exhale)

426
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:27,311
On the count of three.

427
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:29,447
One, two...

428
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:31,682
Wait.

429
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:34,669
I'm a little concerned.

430
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:37,605
Blueberries are rich
in antioxidants.

431
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:38,756
So?

432
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:40,207
So, with all those antioxidants,

433
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,610
what if I run out of oxidants?

434
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:48,833
Sheldon, we haven't won
a game all night.

435
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:51,235
Now, you either stick
your face in that pie

436
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:54,572
or I'm gonna stick
that pie in your face.

437
00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:59,427
That's rude.

438
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,031
One, two, three, eat.

439
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,359
Hey, guys,
guess who's back from space.

440
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:18,278
ALL:
Not now!

441
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,719
Oh, ow, blueberry
in my nose,

442
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,887
blueberry in my nose!

443
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:29,407
Snort it down
and keep eating!

444
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:31,559
(snorts)

445
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,941
You look familiar.

446
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,693
I don't think so.

447
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:51,030
Yeah, I just saw you
on the news.

448
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,982
You're an astronaut.

449
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,283
Yes.
(chuckles)

450
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:55,501
Yes, I am.

451
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:57,803
Good for you.

452
00:19:57,805 --> 00:20:00,056
How about a piece
of cheesecake on the house?

453
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:01,741
Oh, thank you so much.

454
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,209
I've been having
the worst night.

455
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,077
I just got back,
and my friends don't care,

456
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,695
my wife's sick,
I went to my mom...

457
00:20:06,697 --> 00:20:09,548
You want
the cheesecake or not?

458
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:13,118
Yes, please.
