177
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:24,359
And I'm jealous.

178
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:26,928
Oh, God, I'm a mess.

179
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:29,097
God has nothing to
do with your mess.

180
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,832
Look...

181
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:35,069
You didn't sell
your soul, Delilah.

182
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:36,504
You do owe me a favor.

183
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,206
I'm scared.

184
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,641
You should be.

185
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:40,975
Because what
I'm about to ask you

186
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:42,544
is gonna be
quite difficult for you.

187
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,847
Pull yourself together.

188
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,683
That's it, that's
all I'm asking.

189
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,820
'Cause you're wasting
your talent, your life.

190
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,222
Hmm?

191
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,860
You're human, darling.
(chuckles)

192
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,095
I'm gonna do
as you asked.

193
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,498
I'm gonna get
it together.

194
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,800
Promise, Lucifer.

195
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:07,735
Look, it's not about me.

196

What happens now,
that's up to you.

197
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,575
- Okay?
- Yeah.

198
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,043

What did you do?

204
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:02,690
I'm sorry.

205
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,692
"Sorry."

206
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,794
Why did you end her life?

207
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,830
Why else?

208
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:10,265
Money.

209
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,233
"Money."

Yeah, Chloe,
it is your case,

Eddie Deacon, he's
a low-level drug dealer.

228
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:30,411
I found these in his pocket,

229
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:32,447
and I found this
in Delilah's purse,

230
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:33,781
so obviously drug-related.

231
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,783
She probably owed him
a bunch of cash or something.

232
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:38,419
She's not exactly selling out
stadiums these days.

233
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:39,587
How do you know
he's low-level?

234
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,689
Look at his car.

235
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,391
Did you look at his watch?

236

239
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,466
there's gonna be a lot of
attention on this one, Chloe.

240
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:53,434
I wouldn't pick at it too hard.

241
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,069
Not after Palmetto Street.

242
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:58,206
I asked for this case
because of Palmetto Street, Dan.

243
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:02,377
So, anyway, any witnesses?

244
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,179
LUCIFER:
Lucifer Morningstar.

245
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:07,849

Morningstar"?

246
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:10,885
Is that, uh,
a stage name or something?

00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,324
Have we met before?

251
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:19,060
Yeah, five minutes ago.

252
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,294
And I'm asking the questions.

253
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,031
Talk to me about your
relationship with the victim.

254
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,466
Well, she used to work here
a few years back.

255
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,969
I would occasionally
accompany her while she sang.

256
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:31,406
Then she became a big star and
someone decided to end her life.

257
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,673
Do you know the shooter?

258
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,876
No, but we did have
an interesting little chat

259
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,911
just before he kicked off.

260
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,047
I asked him why he did it.

261
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:41,099
Huh, like to play cop, do you?

262
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:41,816
(laughs)

263
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,018
No, I just like to play
in general, Detective.

264
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:45,787
What about you?

265
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:48,856
So, you had a conversation
with a dead guy?

266
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:50,158
Oh, no, he wasn't quite dead.

267
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:51,934
His soul hadn't
crossed the threshold.

268
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,129
I see.
Did he tell you why he did it?

269
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:56,998
Why, money, of course.

270
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,267
You humans, you love your money,
don't you?

271
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,902
Yes.

272
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,270
Yes, we do.

273
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,405
And, uh, what planet
are you from... London?

274
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:05,640
(laughs)

275
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,176
Yes, he also said,
"I just pulled the trigger."

276
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:10,578
Now, don't you think
that's interesting?

277
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,680
Delilah was shot to death
by a drug dealer.

278
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:15,683
And looks like Delilah herself
kept the guy pretty busy.

279
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:18,252
You know, it's sad, it's ugly,
but it's not rocket science.

280
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,121
Something probably
went south between them.

281
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,089
She gets riddled with bullets,

282
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:23,391
and a nice little act of God
takes him out.

283
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,460
You know, it doesn't work
like that, Detective.

284
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,361
It's quite a neatly wrapped
little present

285
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:28,896
for the LAPD, don't you think?

286
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:30,698
Why don't you tell me something?

287
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,166
How does she end up

288
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:33,434
dying in a hailstorm of bullets,

289
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,203
and you get away
without a scratch?

290
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:36,971
I think that's interesting.
Don't you?

291
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,272
The benefits of immortality.

292
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,407

00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:40,441

294
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:42,376
you spell that
with one or two M's?

295
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:43,711
I always forget.

296
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:46,280
What will your corrupt little
organization do about this?

297
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:48,483
Excuse me?

298
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,984

301
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,322

354
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:46,872
I was furious and
I was humiliated

355
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:49,174
when she dumped me,
but I think, I-I think

356
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,876
I've rebounded pretty well.

357
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:53,045
Yes, clearly.
Respect.

358
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,947
JIMMY: Should go
play your mind games

359
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:56,081
with 2Vile.

360
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:57,750
- The rapper?
- Come on.

361
00:14:57,785 --> 00:14:59,551
Delilah dumped me
for that lunatic.

362
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:00,853
They were always fighting.

363
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:02,187
He slapped her
around a bunch.

364
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:04,723
He surrounds himself with
gun-toting morons 24-7.

365
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,692
He is the real deal.

366
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,560
Right.

367
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:10,763
Sorry, how rude.

368
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,664
Allow me to introduce myself.

369
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,534
Lucifer Morningstar.

370
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:18,637
I really don't want to
have sex with him tonight.

371
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,606
(congregation gasping)

372
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,441
Oh, my...

373
00:15:22,476 --> 00:15:23,575
I'm sorry, I...

374
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:25,044
I can't believe
I just said that.

375
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,879
LUCIFER: Oh, no, no, no.
Let's be honest here.

376
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:28,881
I mean, you're not
marrying this human stain

377
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,916
'cause you're actually
in love with him, right?

378
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,284
- God no.
- No.

379
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:33,419
Right.

380
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,887
(claps)
Well, I should get going.

381
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:36,221
Ooh!

382
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:38,590
Best of luck
with you crazy kids, all right?

401
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:26,738
Hello, disc jockey!

402
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:28,674
Thank you.

403
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,242

00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:32,344

406
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:37,616
"Lucifer Morningstar"?

407
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:39,084
(laughs)

408
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,919
Now, that's a good hip-hop name.

409
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:42,221
Well, that offends me.

410
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:45,424
What, you don't like hip-hop?

411
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,925
No, I most certainly do not.

412
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:49,728
Well, that offends me.

413
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:54,166
You have a problem
with black people?

414
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:55,367
No, not in the slightest.

415
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:56,468
I just hate your music.

416
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:58,203
- (laughs)
- And when I say

417
00:16:58,239 --> 00:16:59,705
"your music,"
I mean<i> your</i> music.

418
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,440
Not the music made
by other black people.

419
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:04,476
Without the blues, there'd be
no devil's music whatsoever.

420
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:06,478
There are, of course,
many giants in the field.

421
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:08,046
Just not you...
am I being clear?

422
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:09,615
(chuckles) Yeah, you're
being clear all right.

423
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,717
- Good.
- If you're looking

424
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,152
to get yourself killed.

425
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:16,622
(guns clicking)

426
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,824
Yes, well, don't waste
your munitions... I'm immortal.

427
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,193
Tell me about Delilah.

428
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:23,028
You ain't seen the news?

429
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:24,830
Bitch is dead.

430
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,233
(others gasping, murmuring)

431
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:30,269
(gunshots)

432
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,338
Don't shoot, you idiot!

433
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,542
- I didn't kill her.
- Why should I believe you?

434
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,243
Because I loved the girl.

435
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,279
People sometimes kill people
with whom they're in love.

436
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:42,181
The heart's mysterious.

437
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,949
- So I'm told.
- Ain't like that.

438
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:46,318
Girl made me crazy!

439
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:47,553
Women can do that.

440
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,188
Doesn't mean you should
beat them up, does it?

441
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:50,689
We worked that out
a long time ago.

442
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:53,923
I hit her once 'cause I found
out she was cheating on me.

443
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:01,800
All right.

444
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:03,101
With whom?

445
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:04,436
I don't know.
I don't know.

446
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:05,837
She wouldn't tell me,
all right?

447
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:07,139
Said it was a big secret,

448
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:09,608
some-some, uh, rich married guy.

449
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:11,510
Well, does she have a friend
that she might've confided in?

450
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:12,844
She didn't trust no one, man.

451
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,413
Uh, uh, her therapist.

452
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:16,215
Her therapist is probably
the only one who knows.

453
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,283
She-she's some, uh, uh,
Dr. Linda

454
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,418
in-in Beverly Hills.

455
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:21,687
Saw her, like,
five times a week on the DL.

456
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:23,589
Used a fake name, everything.

457
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,791
Oh, did she now?

458
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:28,527
Well, thank you for your time.

459
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:31,063
CHLOE:
LAPD! Guns down.

460
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:32,197
On the floor, down!

461
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:33,665
You two against the wall.

462
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:36,134
Detective, welcome to the party.

463
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,736
Grab the bucket,
collect the guns.

464
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,638
Now!

465
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:41,573
You sly dog,
you did listen to me.

466
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:42,574
I ran the dead guy's cell phone.

467
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,842
2Vile was the last person
he called.

468
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:45,811
Come on, man.

469
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:47,980
What I find
highly interesting

470
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:49,915
is how you made the
connection on your own.

471
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,617
Well, I've been busy, my dear.

472
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,719
Talk to me about Delilah.

473
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:55,787
We've been over that one,
Detective.

474
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:57,322
And why you called
the shooter

475
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:58,790
two days before
she was murdered.

476
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:01,560
Fine. Yeah, I called Eddie
'cause he hooks me up sometimes.

477
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:02,961
He met Delilah through me.

478
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:05,197
Whatever.
Don't make me a killer, do it?

479
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,799
No, but it does
make you a suspect.

480
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:10,168
What, so everyone on Eddie's
phone's a suspect?

481
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:11,403
Are you joking?

482
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:13,905
You gonna drag
half of Hollywood downtown.

483
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:15,674
Be like the Oscars or something.

484
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:18,076
Wait, aren't you
that chick from that film?

485
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,611
Hmm, what's this?
What film?

486
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:20,748
You used to be an actress
or something, right?

487
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:21,553
Yeah.

488
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:23,415
That teen movie...
I forget what it's called.

489
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,118
Of course.
<i>Hot Tub High School.</i>

490
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:27,419
That's where
I know you from.

491
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:29,021
Let's just stick to my
questions, shall we? So...

492
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,255
The one with
the famous nude scene,

493
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,456
coming out of the hot tub!

494
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:33,358
It was, like, a complete
<i>Fast Times</i> rip-off.

495
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:34,926
She was, like,
the new Phoebe Cates!

496
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:36,395
Thanks, I appreciate that.

497
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,429
That was quite a nude scene.

498
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:38,630
I have far too many bullets

499
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,032
in this thing
for you to still be talking.

500
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:41,933
You, we need to have a
conversation right now.

501
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:43,402
LUCIFER: That's a waste
of time, Detective.

502
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:45,304
I've just threatened his life...
he's not our guy.

503
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:46,605
He would've said, trust me.

504
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,774
You did what?

505
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:50,909
Yeah, isn't that illegal?

506
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:52,678
Uh, little bit, yeah.

507
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,046
You stay put.

508
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:55,247
You, you're coming with me.

509
00:19:55,282 --> 00:19:56,848
What? Ooh.
(laughs)

510
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:58,583
With pleasure.

511
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,452
At least, perhaps now,
you'll listen to me.

512
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:02,788
Although, I'm not quite sure
why I'm being arrested.

513
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:05,223
Because you're interfering
with a police investigation.

514
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:07,693
You've broken I can't
even count how many laws.

515
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:08,860
And you pissed me off.

516
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:10,395
Right, I can get
out of these, you know?

517
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:11,663
Funny.

518
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,200
How'd you do that?

519
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:16,501
(sighs)
Come on, we're wasting time.

520
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:18,303
We should be out there
solving a homicide

521
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:20,205
and punishing those responsible.

522
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,606
"We"?
You're insane.

523
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:23,575
I'm taking you in.
Get in the car.

524
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,743
No, that's boring.

525
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:25,911
Not to mention pointless.

526
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,113
Come on, I'll help you.
It'll be fun.

527
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:29,748
How could you possibly help me?

528
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:31,016
I have a certain skill set.

529
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:33,085
I can be very persuasive
with people

530
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,520
and tend to see things
that others cannot.

531
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:37,289
So, you're psychic or something?

532
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:39,758
No, I can't read people's minds.
I'm not a Jedi.

533
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,326
People just like
to tell me things.

534
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:43,095
Hmm, just-just tell you things?

535
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,763
Just confess their sins,
just like that?

536
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:45,864
No, not their sins.

537
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:47,332
I have no power
over people's sins.

538
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:49,034
I actually get
a bad rap for that.

539
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:50,235
I have the ability

540
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,771
to draw out people's
forbidden desires.

541
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,072
The more simple the human,

542
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:55,273
the easier it is.

543
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:56,675
The more complex,
the more challenging

544
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,176
and exciting, really.

545
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:00,612
But no, the actual sins,
the sins are on you people.

546
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:02,114
"You people"?

547
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,149
I got it.

548
00:21:04,184 --> 00:21:05,784
I got it! The name?

549
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:07,018
The whole Lucifer thing?

550
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:08,987
And desire's, like,
your superpower.

551
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:11,423
Mm, it's more like
a gift from God really.

552
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,658
Okay, look.

553
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:16,094
Tell me, Detective,

554
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,264
what do you desire more than
anything else in this life?

555
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,134
This is it?
This is your big trick?

556
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:29,708
(sighs)

557
00:21:29,743 --> 00:21:32,010
I guess,
when I was a little girl,

558
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:35,781
I... always wanted to be a cop
like my daddy,

559
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:40,018
so that... that one day
I could help people and...

560
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:42,491
and be taken seriously...

561
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:46,091
...when I say to shut up
and get in the damn car.

562
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,497
You're not, like, a Jedi
or something, are you?

563
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,599
Get in the car.

564
00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:55,934
No, no, no, no, no.
Look.

565
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:57,102
I know something you don't know.

566
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:58,870
Really? What's that?

567
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:00,472
Won't say unless you
take me with you on this.

568
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:03,975
Please, come on.
I got to 2Vile, didn't I?

569
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:05,710
Why do you care
about this so much?

570
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:06,945
About Delilah?

571
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:12,117
Look, I just... I just do.

572
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:13,785
Look, if I hadn't meddled
with her career,

573
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:16,121
maybe she wouldn't
have died.

574
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:17,122
Okay.

575
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:18,657
Okay, fine...
but if this

576
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:20,625
little clue thing of yours
doesn't pan out,

577
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:23,028
these are going back on,
and they're gonna stay on.

578
00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:24,765
Is that a promise?

579
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:35,045
CHLOE: <i>Yeah, therapist
in Beverly Hills</i>

580
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,213
<i>with the first name Linda.</i>

581
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:37,681
See if Delilah
was a client.

582
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:38,982
Ah-ah, actually,
she had a pseudonym,

583
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:40,217
which I also
happen to know.

584
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:41,651
I'm quite good
at this, aren't I?

585
00:22:41,687 --> 00:22:44,421
- Uh, Penny Lane.
- Okay.

586
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:46,656
Delilah may have gone
by Penny Lane. Thanks.

587
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:51,161
Don't look so smug.

588
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:52,195
Nothing's
panned out yet.

589
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:53,430
No, no, no, it's not that.

590
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:55,131
It's just that I knew
that I recognized you.

591
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,800
Right.

592
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,468
Right, you've seen my boobies.

593
00:22:58,503 --> 00:22:59,436
It's exciting.

594
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:00,503
What, are you 12?

595
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,638
So is the, uh... is the movie

596
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,440
why you've got such
a chip on your shoulder?

597
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,909
Uh, it's low on the list

598
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:07,844
- of things I have to live down, I guess.
- Right.

599
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,146
Attractive female cop
struggling to be taken seriously

600
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,815
in a man's man's world...
that it?

601
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,484
Yeah, something like that.

602
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,819
Well, they're
threatened.

603
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,755
You're clearly smart
and have notable instincts.

604
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,819
Ignore them. Trust yourself.

605
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:22,826
(cell phone rings)

606
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,495
Detective Decker.

607
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,796
All right,
text it to me.

608
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:28,331
Thanks.

609
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,899
What's that?

610
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:30,965
(sighs)

611
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,869
What you were
saying stands up.

612
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:34,170
There's a Penny
Lane who sees

613
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,905
a Dr. Linda Martin
in Beverly Hills.

614
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:38,141
Excellent.
I'll clear my schedule.

615
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:39,337
(cell phone rings)

616
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:40,477
Ooh, someone's popular.

617
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:41,511
Please stop talking.

618
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,313
Hello.

619
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:45,412
What? You're kidding me.
Is she okay?

620
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:48,385
Oh, of course he's not there.

621
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,719
Thanks.

622
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:51,755
We got to make
a pit stop.

623
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,856
What?
No, absolutely not.

624
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,325
My kid got into a fight.
I got to pick her up.

625
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,027
What, can't she get
herself home?

626
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,361
She's seven.

627
00:23:58,397 --> 00:23:59,863
Look, I'm not here
to help you run errands.

628
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,364
I'm here to help you
solve a homicide.

629
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,166
Really?

630
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,204
("Sinister Kid"
by the Black Keys playing)

631
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:15,512
CHLOE:

632
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:17,080
Wait here.

633
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:18,381
With pleasure.

634
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,949

Oh, dear, what will
become of me?

644
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,393
My mother is
a police officer.

645
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:05,128
She could arrest you.

646
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:06,156
(lighter snaps shut)

647
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:09,328
Oh, I think I might
know your mother.

648
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:10,433
What's your name?

649
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:12,135
Lucifer.

650
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,937
(whispering):
Like the Devil?

651
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,705
Exactly.

652
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:19,642
My name's Beatrice, but
everybody calls me Trixie.

653
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:21,644
That's a hooker's name.

654
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,979
What's a hooker?

655
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:24,948
Ask your mother.

656
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,951
So... why are you
in trouble?

657
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,120
See that girl
over there?

658
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:32,722
She was bullying me.

659
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:34,391
She created a fake
Snapchat account

660
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:36,025
and used it to
make fun of me.

661
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:40,663
So... I kicked her in the
no-no-touch-touch square.

662
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:44,134
Oh. Oh, I see.

663
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:47,036
Well played.

664
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:48,505
Well played, indeed.

665
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,449
Hello, mean girl.

666
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:56,946
Did you know there's a
special section of Hell

667
00:25:56,982 --> 00:25:58,081
reserved for bullies?

668
00:25:58,116 --> 00:26:00,450
So have fun.

669
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,492
(screams)

670
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:07,991
What did you do?

671
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,959
Oh...

672
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:12,896
I just think someone's feeling
a little guilty.

673
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,691
(school bell rings)

674
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,672
Hi, Daddy.

675
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,007
Hi, munchkin.

676
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,175
CHLOE: Wow, shocker,
you're late.

677
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,342
Come on, give
me a break.

678
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,644
I'm putting
a case to bed.

679
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,145
Right, like I'm not
working a case, too.

680
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:31,781
Oh, yeah, the one
you tried to steal from me.

681
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,216
You mean the open and shut one.

682
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:36,252
You did open and shut it, right?

683
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:38,121
I'm being diligent, Dan.
It's a high-profile case.

684
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:39,956
Exactly, which is why you
need to be smart about it.

685
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:41,891
She is smart.
You're the dimwit.

686
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,961
Perhaps you should refrain from
arguing in front of the child.

687
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:46,129
It's unbecoming.

688
00:26:47,432 --> 00:26:49,499
I don't know whether to laugh
or to shoot you.

689
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:51,434
Surprise me.

690
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,058
Isn't he funny, Daddy?

691
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,538
CHLOE: Hey, can you, uh,
drop Trix at my mom's?

692
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,040
We got to go. Thank you.

693
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,142
Trixella, give
Mommy a kiss.

694
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:01,044
I love you so much.

695
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,779
Good job standing up
to the mean girl.

696
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:04,147
Thanks, Mommy.

697
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:06,082
What's a hooker?

698
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:11,354
Daddy will tell you.

699
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:16,759
Bye, Lucifer.

700
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:18,261
It was nice meeting you.

701
00:27:19,397 --> 00:27:20,897
CHLOE:
Hmm.

702
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,232
Think she likes you.

703
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,909
Of course she does...
what's not to like?

704
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:39,128
Was your offspring
planned or a mistake?

705
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:42,131
Planned, sort of.

706
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,566
Really?

707
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:45,234
'Cause I've never understood
the human desire to procreate.

708
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,036
That's probably
a good thing.

709
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:48,771
I mean, children are
hideous little creatures,

710
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:50,139
terrible, taxing burdens.

711
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:52,241
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

712
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:53,976
Oh, um, yours is fine.

713
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:56,379
I mean, you know,
nothing to crow about,

714
00:27:56,414 --> 00:27:57,913
but nothing to be too
embarrassed about, either,

715
00:27:57,949 --> 00:27:59,048
so that's quite good, isn't it?

716
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,018
Are you at all aware
of how dickish you sound?

717
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:03,185
No.

718
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,356
Speaking of dicks...

719
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:08,824
why was that ex-husband of yours

720
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,845
pressuring you
to close the case?

721
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,417
No reason.

722
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:16,266
Strange.

723
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:18,445
Yes, you are.

724
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:21,104
Did my father send you?

725
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:22,538
(door opens)

726
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:25,274
Okay, Detectives,
I'll see you now.

727
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,709
CHLOE:
Thank you.

728
00:28:26,744 --> 00:28:28,244
Oh. "Detectives."

729
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:31,247
CHLOE: Dr. Martin,
I'd like to ask you

730
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:33,082
a few questions
about Delilah.

731
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:40,189
You're thinking
about it, aren't you?

732
00:28:40,224 --> 00:28:41,357
What?

733
00:28:41,392 --> 00:28:42,558
Yes, I wouldn't
recommend it.

734
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:43,859
I'm like walking heroin.

735
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:45,861
Very habit-forming.
It never ends well.

736
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:46,962
(sighs)

737
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:49,598
I'm sorry, do... do you two
know each other?

738
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:51,267
No, no, but I know that look.

739
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:54,203
I don't know
what you're talking about.

740
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:56,472
That is interesting

741
00:28:56,507 --> 00:28:59,208
'cause... you don't
look at me that way.

742
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:01,243
- What way?
- With carnal fascination.

743
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,645
That's 'cause
it doesn't exist.

744
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,847
No, you see, that's just it...
with most women, it does.

745
00:29:04,882 --> 00:29:06,649
I tend to appeal to the
dark, mischievous hearts

746
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:09,885
in all of you, but
you, Detective,

747
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:12,054
you seem oddly
immune to my charms.

748
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,091
Referring to them as "charms,"
I think, is a bit of a stretch.

749
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:16,726
Truth be told,
I find you repulsive.

750
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:18,427
Like, on a
chemical level.

751
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,628
That's fascinating.

752
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:22,398
LUCIFER:
Now, tell me, Linda...

753
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:23,999
You say it's fascinating,

754
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:27,069
and yet I can see that it
disturbs you, doesn't it?

755
00:29:27,105 --> 00:29:29,538
Deeply.

756
00:29:29,574 --> 00:29:31,140
CHLOE:
Dr. Martin,

757
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:33,476
we know that, um, Delilah was
having a clandestine affair

758
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:35,311
with a wealthy married man,
so if you just

759
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:37,413
tell us his name,
we will be on our way.

760
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,315
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

761
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,083
Oh, she's one of
the complex ones.

762
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,318
Linda,

763
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:44,920
darling, why don't
you tell me? Hmm?

764
00:29:44,956 --> 00:29:46,078
Well, I can't.

765
00:29:46,113 --> 00:29:47,123
(Lucifer chuckles)

766
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:49,558
I want to, but I can't.

767
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:50,659
(laughs)

768
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:52,995
(laughing):
Oh, you're the devil.

769
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,297
(chuckles)
Correct.

770
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,966
Now, come on, Dr. Martin.

771
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:58,334
I know you want to.

772
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:01,604
Oh, man, and it's really,
really juicy, too.

773
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:02,772
Ooh, I bet it is.

774
00:30:02,807 --> 00:30:04,073
No, I can't.

775
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:05,408
What did you do to her?

776
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:06,375
Did you roofie her?

777
00:30:06,411 --> 00:30:07,410
Oh, no, it's
not her fault.

778
00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:08,778
She's just
reacting to me.

779
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:11,147
Just watch
and learn, okay?

780
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:12,415
Right, the answer is yes,

781
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,784
we can take a trip
to pound town if we must,

782
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:18,754
but first, you're gonna have
to tell us, Linda, okay?

783
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,456
(moaning):
Um...

784
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:23,025
(chuckles)

785
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,623
Okay... (chuckles)
it's Grey Cooper.

786
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:28,765
Grey Cooper?

787
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,732
Seriously?

788
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,200
That is juicy.

789
00:30:31,235 --> 00:30:32,468
Grey Cooper, the actor?

790
00:30:32,503 --> 00:30:34,069
The one who's married
to Amanda what's-her-chops?

791
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:35,404
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,206
Oh, no,
he's horrible.

793
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:40,761
So square-jawed,
so handsome, so vanilla.

794
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:42,478
Oh, I'm really quite
disappointed in Delilah.

795
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:46,015
That's truly terrible taste
in the opposite sex.

796
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,450
Thank you very
much, Dr. Martin.

797
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:48,451
We'll be in touch.

798
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:49,752
All right,
we got to go.

799
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:51,353
Yes, of course,
but I... I made a deal,

800
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:53,289
so I'm gonna have to hold up
my end of the bargain.

801
00:30:53,324 --> 00:30:55,391
You wouldn't mind
waiting outside?

802
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:56,992
Are you seriously talking

803
00:30:57,028 --> 00:30:58,694
about having sex
with her right now?

804
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:00,896
- Well, it won't take long.
- I do yoga.

805
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:05,634
Hot... yoga.

806
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,304
I'm freakishly flexible.

807
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:09,772
Want to see?

808
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,876
Wow!

809
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:17,580
(chuckles)

810
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:20,316
I really tried
to keep that one in.

811
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:23,018
Well, you tried...
that's what matters.

812
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:24,453
Uh, look,
I'm really sorry,

813
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:26,455
but I'm gonna have
to take a rain check.

814
00:31:26,491 --> 00:31:27,590
I will be back, okay?

815
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:28,824
I certainly hope so.

816
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,994
My word is my bond.

00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:45,908
Ah, excuse me. Thank you.

822
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:48,210
Hey, hey, sir.

823
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:50,479
(tires squealing, gunfire)

824
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:57,219
Who the (bell rings)
is this guy?

825
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:59,622
What the hell are you doing?

826
00:31:59,657 --> 00:32:00,856
CHLOE: Excuse me.
Excuse me.

827
00:32:00,892 --> 00:32:02,258
Sorry. Excuse me.

828
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:04,527
Sorry, he's with me.

829
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,830
That's not Grey Cooper.

830
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:09,164
No, of course not.

831
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,399
What the hell is this?

832
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:12,434
We need to speak
with Mr. Cooper.

833
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:18,073
God, Delilah, yeah,
heard about that this morning.

834
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,141
I can't believe it.

835
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:21,510
We did a movie
together last year.

836
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:22,545
Got pretty close.

837
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,680
- Lovers?
- Friends.

838
00:32:24,715 --> 00:32:26,248
Friends who were lovers?

839
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:27,383
CHLOE:
Settle down.

840
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:28,684
I'll handle
the questions.

841
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:30,619
Mr. Cooper, when did you last
have contact with Delilah?

842
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:32,154
Well, actually, I just
have one more question

843
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:33,756
before you proceed
with the boring ones.

844
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:36,358
Tell me, Mr. Cooper,

845
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:38,627
what do you want more
than anything in this world?

846
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:40,663
What's your deepest,
darkest desire?

847
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:43,933
You close your eyes,
what do you see?

848
00:32:43,968 --> 00:32:48,470
I'm the president of the
United States of America.

849
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:49,705
Ha!

850
00:32:50,863 --> 00:32:52,808
Well, who's the Devil now, eh?

851
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:54,777
Those are some pretty big
aspirations there,

852
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:57,279
- Mr. Cooper.
- (chuckles) Well, after the acting

853
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:59,148
- and stuff.
- No need

854
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:01,550
to be embarrassed. Hell,
if Arnold can do it, right?

855
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:02,572
- (chuckles)
- Now, you wouldn't

856
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:03,486
want any nasty secrets

857
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:05,054
screwing that up for you,
though, would you?

858
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,622
Is there a point to this?

859
00:33:06,657 --> 00:33:09,024
Mr. Cooper, were you having
an affair with Delilah?

860
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,059
AMANDA:
Honey!

861
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:11,560
Have you been
getting my texts?

862
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:12,962
I thought they were
breaking you for lunch

863
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:14,563
like a half hour ago.

864
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:16,465
What's going on?

865
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,968
These people are detectives.

866
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:19,969
Real ones?

867
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:22,071
We have some questions
about Delilah.

868
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:24,173
Oh. Oh. Yes, it's so sad.

869
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:26,343
Yeah. Very sad.

870
00:33:26,644 --> 00:33:28,547
Your watch,
where'd you get that?

871
00:33:28,846 --> 00:33:30,312
Oh, it's a prop.

872
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:31,347
AMANDA:
No, that's the one

873
00:33:31,382 --> 00:33:32,314
Delilah gave you, isn't it?

874
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,682
For<i> Time Will Tell?</i>

875
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:36,118
GREY: Right.
That's the movie

876
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:38,387
that we did.
It was a wrap gift.

877
00:33:38,422 --> 00:33:40,723
(chuckles)
Yeah. She buy a $10,000 watch

878
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:42,291
- for the whole crew?
- Uh, no.

879
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:44,493
Just me, as far as I know.

880
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:46,829
'Cause we were,
you know,

881
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:48,430
costars and everything.

882
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,766
You know, you're gonna have
to get much better at lying

883
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:52,134
if you want to be president.

884
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:54,370
I know, right?

885
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:56,952
So you were sleeping
with her, then, yeah?

886
00:33:57,545 --> 00:34:00,494
- Oh, yeah. (chuckles)
- (laughing)

887
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:07,116
Crap. I just said that
in front of people.

888
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:08,717
Whatever.
It's not like I didn't know.

889
00:34:08,753 --> 00:34:10,486
God, you are a
terrible liar.

890
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:11,754
And actor, by the way.

891
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:13,122
- You knew?
- Of course.

892
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:16,659
Why else do you think I've been
sleeping with Bobby?

893
00:34:16,694 --> 00:34:17,826
Are you serious?

894
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:19,762
Oh, yeah. And it is good.

895
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:22,331
Mmm. I climb that man
like a tree.

896
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:23,298
Right, Bobby?

897
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:25,034
GREY:
My bodyguard?

898
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:26,902
What a cliché.

899
00:34:26,937 --> 00:34:29,004
Oh, I'm a cliché?
Well, you're a dick.

900
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,172
Oh, boy.

901
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,242
- Hey, guys...
- Come on!

902
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:35,778
Hey, guys. Arrest them.

903
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:38,047
- Seriously?
- (grunting)

904
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:40,983
One of them's got
to be guilty.

905

00:34:55,587 --> 00:34:58,154
Thanks.
(sighs)

909
00:34:58,189 --> 00:35:02,492
So, Grey and Amanda have
zero connection to the shooter.

910
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:05,395
(sighs) But the shooter had
the same watch as Grey.

911
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,063
That can't be a coincidence.

912
00:35:07,098 --> 00:35:11,768
Maybe Delilah gave him one, too,
like kind of a go-to gift. I...

913
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:13,236
Well, that would imply
she was actually

914
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:14,337
sleeping with that maggot.

915
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:16,139
Really?

916
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:19,142
Jimmy, 2Vile,
Grey Cooper.

917
00:35:19,177 --> 00:35:20,610
That's three other maggots
she's sleeping with.

918
00:35:20,645 --> 00:35:22,745
I don't think there's a lot
of discretion going on with her.

919
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:24,180
Yeah. I suppose you got a point.

920
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,482
(chuckles softly)

921
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:28,618
God, what am I doing here?

922
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:31,220
Wrong deity, but, yes,
that is the eternal question.

923
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:34,023
(chuckles)
No. I mean here, in a bar,

924
00:35:34,058 --> 00:35:35,358
- with you.
- Well, I don't know.

925
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:37,160
You tell me, Detective.

926
00:35:37,195 --> 00:35:39,529
I mean, despite
your proclaimed revulsion,

927
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:42,131
you can't deny that
there's a connection between us.

928
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:45,201
Tell me, what do
you actually want?

929
00:35:45,236 --> 00:35:48,204
You mean what do I desire
more than anything else

930
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,572
- in this life?
- Yes.

931
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:50,796
- Mm-hmm.
- No tricks. Not that they work

932
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:52,041
on you, you freak.

933
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:53,376
(chuckles)

934
00:35:54,312 --> 00:35:56,913
Seriously. I'm curious.

935
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,448
I don't know.

936
00:35:58,483 --> 00:36:00,149
What-what I told you's true.

937
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:03,286
I-I really do want
to help people.

938
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:05,822
My father was a cop.

939
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:07,356
He was a great cop.

940
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:09,125
My mother was an actress.

941
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,626
Really cheesy one.
(chuckles)

942
00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:13,830
I tried the acting thing.
I took off my top.

943
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:16,365
Wasn't really contributing
to the betterment of society.

944
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:18,501
I disagree. I love that movie.

945
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:19,769
(chuckles)

946
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:20,837
So I quit.

947
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:22,538
Decided to become a cop
like my dad

948
00:36:22,574 --> 00:36:25,208
and, uh, dealt with the whole
<i>Hot Tub High School</i> thing,

949
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:26,876
until, um,

950
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:29,078
I became a detective
and found a whole new way

951
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:31,447
- to ostracize myself.
- Ah, the...

952
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:33,950
reason your ex-maggot
was pressuring you

953
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,585
to close this?

954
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,153
Yeah. Yeah.

955
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:39,355
Exactly. There was a case,

956
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,191
a shooting on Palmetto Street
where a cop was shot,

957
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:44,460
and I saw it differently
than pretty much everyone

958
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:46,596
in my department,
including my ex.

959
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:48,297
And I stuck
my neck out,

960
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,399
and it backfired.

961
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:52,468
And, uh, now...

962
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:55,204
(chuckles)
no one wants to work with me.

963
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,206
Well, I'm available.

964
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:00,409
Too bad your little protégé

965
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:01,744
isn't around
to collect the check.

966
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:03,045

The soundtrack album

for the movie<i> Time Will Tell</i>

00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:07,083
has reached number 15
on the Billboard charts

969
00:37:07,118 --> 00:37:08,851
and is still climbing.
Song and record sales...

970
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:10,219
Oh, wow.

971
00:37:11,222 --> 00:37:12,688
What?

972
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:16,726
Delilah didn't give that watch
to the drug dealer.

973
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:24,133
♪ Got a heavy load,
sometimes I wonder... ♪

974
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:25,160
- Stop, stop, stop!

975
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:28,052
What is it? You got a gerbil in
your throat? What's going on?

976
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:31,107
Hello, Jimmy.

977
00:37:31,142 --> 00:37:32,842
Really?

978
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,477
How's the album sales doing?

979
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:35,811
What album?

980
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:38,114
Soundtrack to<i> Time Will Tell,</i>
which you produced.

981
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:41,584
Whitney Houston hit the top ten
for album sales after her death.

982
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:43,553
Michael Jackson hit
the stratosphere.

983
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:46,556
Not sure you'll achieve such
heights having Delilah killed,

984
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:49,792
but that sure is a boatload of
royalty checks headed your way.

985
00:37:49,827 --> 00:37:53,296
Guess you really
needed the cash, huh?

986
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:56,566
Which is why you had to pay
the shooter with your watch.

987
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:58,868
The watch Delilah gave you.
Now, that's just sick.

988
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,636
But then you are, so...

989
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,562
(gun clicks)

990
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:04,807
Hey, Jimmy?

991
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:06,309
I made her,
and she ruined me.

992
00:38:06,344 --> 00:38:09,278
She humiliated me.
She owes me.

993
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:11,809
You're not God, Jimmy.
You didn't make her.

994
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:13,482
But you did destroy her.

995
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:15,384
So I'm gonna punish you.

996
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,054
You back off,
you freak. I mean it.

997
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:20,323
I am not going to jail
for that bitch. No chance.

998
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:21,691
Listen to him,
Lucifer. Back off.

999
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:23,759
I told you, it's fine.
I'm immortal.

1000
00:38:26,364 --> 00:38:28,664
Why did you do that?

1001
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,733
- He was gonna kill you.
- No, no, no,

1002
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:33,669
no, no, no. You just...
you just let him off too easy.

1003
00:38:33,705 --> 00:38:35,738
He needs to pay!
He needs to suffer!

1004
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,373
He needs to feel the pain,

1005
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:39,842
- not escape it!
- Don't worry.

1006
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:42,244
I'm sure where he's going,
the pain's coming.

1007
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,080
No. No, it's not, actually.

1008
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:46,215
And you know why?
Because I'm here and he's...

1013
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:01,631
(weakly):
I don't want to die.

1014
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:04,367
I won't let you.

1015
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,510

00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:16,345

please! Please.

1022
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,225
Please don't kill me.

1023
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,559
Oh, Jimmy.

1024
00:39:32,563 --> 00:39:34,263
You're gonna wish
that's all

1025
00:39:34,298 --> 00:39:36,999
- I did to you.

1026
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:52,882
LUCIFER:
Well,

1027
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:55,685
look who's back.

1028
00:39:57,989 --> 00:39:59,789
(groans)

1029
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,393
How long have I been out?

1030
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:07,396
(sighs)
Three years.

1031
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:09,598
What?

1032
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:10,866
(chuckling)

1033
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,370
You're such an ass.

1034
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:16,539
- Thank you.
- Oh, God.

1035
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:21,963
He was firing at you.

1036
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:24,059
Why aren't you...

1037
00:40:24,182 --> 00:40:26,041
more dead?

1038
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:28,384
You're having a very hard time
with the immortal thing,

1039
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:30,519
aren't you?

1040
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:32,088
(sighs)

1041
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:35,491
- What happened with Jimmy?
- Jimmy?

1042
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:37,960
Jimmy got what he deserved.

1043
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:39,895
Hmm?

1044
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,666
Well, I'm pretty sure
I'd be dead

1045
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:45,201
if you hadn't helped me,
so...

1046
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:47,336
thank you.

1047
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:49,271
Sorry, what was that?
That last bit.

1048
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:51,373
I didn't quite
get that.

1049
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,143
Thank you.

1050
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,179
You're welcome.

1051
00:40:57,215 --> 00:40:58,981
And, besides, you know,

1052
00:40:59,016 --> 00:41:02,182
you're far too interesting
to let die.

1053
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,754
You saved my life
because I'm interesting?

1054
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:06,889
Wildly irritating as well,
but yes.

00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,124
(chuckles softly)

1056
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:11,594
So what now?

1057
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:13,195
Well, I mean,
I've obviously proven myself

1058
00:41:13,231 --> 00:41:14,597
to be an invaluable
crime-fighting tool.

1059
00:41:14,632 --> 00:41:17,032
You're a pariah
in the department.

1060
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:18,200
I think this could be the start

1061
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:19,335
of a beautiful friendship.
Don't you?

1062
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,470
Who the hell are you?

1063
00:41:21,506 --> 00:41:23,739
I told you, I'm...

1064
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,441
Lucifer!

1065
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:28,577
Uh, yes. Hello, child.

1066
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:30,613
Um, just... Why don't you save

1067
00:41:30,648 --> 00:41:32,448
some of this unpleasantness
for your mother, yeah?

1068
00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:33,716
- (groans)
- Ooh.

1069
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:35,718
- Sorry.
- Oh.

1070
00:41:35,753 --> 00:41:37,887
- God.
- Are you hurt?

1071
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:39,121
I'm okay.

1072
00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:40,823
LUCIFER: Right.
Well, I'd stay for

1073
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:42,958
the family reunion,
but it's giving me terrible IBS.

1074
00:41:42,994 --> 00:41:45,528
So, look forward
to seeing you soon, Chloe.

1075
00:41:45,563 --> 00:41:47,530
- I don't.
- Bye, now.

1076
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:49,064

I've been watching you, Lucifer.

1083
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:14,423
- You perv.
- And I'm not sure

1084
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:16,058
I like what I see.

1085

You're showing restraint, mercy.

You scared I'm turning my back
on the dark side, bro?

1087
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:25,634
Lucifer, there is a balance here
that we must maintain.

1088
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,304
I strongly suggest you do
what I told you to do

1089
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:29,738
and go back to Hell.

1090
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:32,741
Don't threaten me, Amenadiel.

1091
00:42:32,777 --> 00:42:35,377

to start a war.

Oh, Luci.

00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:47,156
My hatred for you grows stronger
with every visit.

1096
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:50,459
Well, I wouldn't have it
any other way, pal.

00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:15,885
I sense your
disapproval, Maze.

1102
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,853
What is it?

1103
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:23,292
I just can't understand
why you would save a human life.

1104
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:25,794
Well, there's...
something different about her

1105
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,364
that I don't quite understand,
and it vexes me.

1106
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,933
Maybe it's not her
that's different.

1107
00:43:30,968 --> 00:43:33,569

where I'm supposed to ask,

"Whatever do you mean?"

1109
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:38,007
I'm worried the humans
are rubbing off on you.
