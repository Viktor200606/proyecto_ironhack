00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,179
Howie, slow down.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:08,930
I can't.

3
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:10,932
I'm not allowed to eat
for 12 hours before my surgery,

4
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:13,468
and I only got two more minutes.

5
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:18,907
What surgery are you having?

6
00:00:18,909 --> 00:00:20,575
I'm stress eating.

7
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:24,045
My best friend's getting
a vasectomy tomorrow.

8
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:27,115
And you're sad you won't be able
to bear his child?

9
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,451
Oh, my goodness.

10
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:30,952
If it's “vasectomy
gone wrong” videos,

11
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:32,253
he's seen them all.

12
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:33,888
Including the one of
the guy who's sitting

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,192
on what appears to be a
cantaloupe but is not.

14
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:40,328
And I'm done.

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,163
They're going
to start making

16
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:44,099
Professor Proton's
science show again.

17
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:45,670
<b><font color="#f93200">BERNADETTE</font></b> :
I thought he passed away.

18
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,202
He did.

19
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:47,402
He was cremated,
and his remains

20
00:00:47,404 --> 00:00:49,604
were put
in a baking soda volcano.

<b><font color="#f93200">LEONARD</font></b> : Oh, me, too.

23
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:56,578
I grew up watching his show.

24
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,613
He's one of the reasons
I became a scientist.

25
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,716
Aw. Thought you did it
just to get girls.

26
00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:03,618
Joke's on you. It worked.

27
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:07,388
Have they found anyone
to replace him?

28
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,324
No, not yet,
and it won't be easy.

29
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:11,772
Arthur Jeffries was
an accomplished scientist.

30
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:12,495
Mm.

31
00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:14,929
You know who'd make
a great Professor Proton?

32
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:17,265
Meryl Streep.

33
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:19,901
She's not a scientist.

34
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:21,603
Uh, then explain to me why

35
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:25,006
she has chemistry
with literally everyone.

36
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:28,042
It would be nice
if they cast a woman.

37
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:30,078
Oh, you've already got <i>Doctor</i>
<i>Who</i> and the <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,880
Leave us something.

39
00:01:32,883 --> 00:01:34,115
Who do you think it should be?

40
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:36,451
Well, it should be a scientist
I respect.

41
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:38,887
You know,
someone with a pleasing voice

42
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:41,523
and symmetrical facial features.

43
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:43,091
Is he talking
about himself?

44
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:45,827
If he's talking,
he's talking about himself.

45
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:49,831
I just know how much Professor
Proton touched me as a child,

46
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,167
and I feel that I owe it to him

47
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:56,004
to try and touch
as many children as possible.

48
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,610
You should put that
on your audition tape.

Gift shop.

63
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:56,053
There is no gift shop.
Sit down.

64
00:02:57,757 --> 00:02:59,490
This was your idea.

65
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:02,426
So was having sex, and
look where that got us.

66
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:05,936
This isn't a big deal.
Stop whining.

67

I said that, you kicked me.

rolling.

85
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:04,961
Hello. I am theoretical
physicist, Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

86
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:07,363
auditioning for the role
of Professor Proton.

87
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:10,033
Now, excuse me
while I get into character.

88
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,872
Hello. I am Professor Proton.

89
00:04:15,874 --> 00:04:17,574
And today,

90
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:20,109
boys and girls, we're going
to have fun with science.

91
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,579
Did you know you could calculate
the mass of an electron

92
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:24,581
using household items?
It's true.

93
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,716
All you'll need is a pencil,
some paper,

94
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:28,751
dry ice, rubbing alcohol,

95
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:32,856
and a spool of 50-micron-thick
cobalt-60 wire.

96
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:36,292
And, remember,
don't put it in your mouth,

97
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:37,760
or instead
of becoming a scientist,

98
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:40,630
you'll become
wildly radioactive.

99
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:43,199
Hang on. I have
a question.

100
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:46,069
Do you have any experiments
that aren't life-threatening?

101
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:49,305
Come on! That was a perfect
take, and you ruined it.

102
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:52,575
Oh, look!
Hey, I did need enraged.

103
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,847
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

104
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,649
Really hurts, huh?
<b><font color="#f93200">BERNADETTE</font></b> : No.

He's just saying,
“Ow can these prices be so low”.

106
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:06,623
It's gonna be okay.
A day or two of rest,

107
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,857
and you'll be fine.

108
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:10,727
You know nothing
about Jewish people.

110
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:16,332
Um, let me go check on her.

111
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:20,136
Okay, uh, this is
a bit awkward.

112
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:22,372
It says here
that I need to check the area

113
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:24,908
for redness and swelling.

114
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:28,912
You know what?
It hurts so much, go ahead.

115
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:33,249
So you see, boys and girls,

116
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,085
H, or helicity,
is the natural variable

117
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,689
to use relativistically
and is defined as S dot P,

118
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:41,691
divided
by the magnitude of P.

119
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:44,060
So the next time someone
on the playground tells you

120
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:46,396
you can only use integral values
for the matrix

121
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:48,364
that determines the spin
of the antiproton,

122
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:51,668
you stop being friends with that
kid, 'cause he's going nowhere.

123
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,074

Professor Proton saying,

it would be... better

Well, you want me to lie?

161

Well, it's not
lying-- it's acting.

162
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,437
Sheldon Cooper
may not like kids,

163
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,906
but Professor Proton loves them.

164
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:39,008
Interesting.

really thought

166

to how I'm afraid of dogs,

168
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:48,518
but my <i>D&D</i> character likes dogs,
you know?

169
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:52,488
But he's allergic,
so he can't be around them.

170
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,325
Why don't we
have a dog?

171

Hey, you can
always reshoot it.

172
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:02,465
Mm, I suppose. And, you know,
maybe I could even get some tips

I can't. I got my 16-week

No, it's fine.
Great.

he's not even a scientist.

What legacy?

My-my last two seasons,
I was on Sunday morning

the day he ever met me.

L-Let's shake things up

that there's a show

00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:15,051
to get kids excited
about science?

What if the reboot is great?

317
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,663
That's even worse.

00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,632
If-if I like it, I'll feel like
I'm being disloyal to Arthur.

319

He was a mentor

320
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:34,637

for some Hollywood pretty boy

321
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,372

322
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:38,775
It's hard to argue with him.

323

00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:11,641
Penny, everything
all right?!

Hey. All good.

337
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:18,514
Dipped her pacifier in a little
bourbon, she conked right out.

338
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:21,985
I hope you're joking.

339
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:25,455
Of course I'm joking.
I don't share my bourbon.

340
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,291
She's joking.

Definitely.

342
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,263
Probably.

343
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,802
Wil Wheaton. Wil Wheaton.

344
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:42,005
This is Sheldon, by the way.

345
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,875
Hi, Sheldon.

346
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:49,412
Here, I found this pizza flyer
in your fence.

347
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:50,446
Thank you.

348
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,615
Okay, now you owe me a favor.

349
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:55,818
Turn down the role
of Professor Proton.

350
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,420
<b><font color="#9b75ff">(</font><font color="#0000ff">chuckles</font><font color="#9b75ff">)</font></b>
I don't think so.

351
00:15:57,422 --> 00:16:01,124
You can't be Professor Proton.
You're not a scientist.

352
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,358
Well, I was never on a starship,

353
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,594
but pretending I was
bought me this house.

354
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,629
And if I'd pretended
a little longer,

355
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,731
it would have a swimming pool.

356
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:11,234
Some things
shouldn't be rebooted.

357
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,202
Some things were perfect
the way they were.

358
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:15,805
Like the walled city of York--
it was a delight.

359
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,941
But New York? Blech.

360
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,011
Did you ever consider that maybe
Arthur would be happy to know

361
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,680
that his show has outlived him?

362
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,714
I doubt it.

363
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:27,083
He was kind of a mean old crank.

364
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:31,354
Sheldon, I promise
that I will work my hardest

365
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:32,789
to make this show great

366
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,390
so that a whole
new generation of kids

367
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,392
will grow up
and they will be able to say

368
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:39,962
that Professor Proton was the
reason they got into science.

369
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,598
Wow.

370
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,134
That was very persuasive.

371
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:46,302
Thanks.

372
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:48,304
But I won't be seduced
by your acting skills

373
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:51,007
nor your movie star charisma.

374
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,976
There's
only one Professor Proton,

375
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:56,412
and he had neither
of those things.

376
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:59,115
I'll give you one more
chance to bow out.

377
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,317
Or what?

378
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,954
When we first met,
we were enemies,

379
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:08,458
but we worked through that
and we became friends.

380
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,460
Do you really want to go back?

381
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,796
Honestly, it doesn't feel
very different.

382
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,634
I'm not leaving!

383
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:21,337
All right, I'm gonna sic
my dog on you.

384
00:17:22,173 --> 00:17:24,173
You don't have a dog.

385
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:25,575
Yes, I do.

386
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,510
Ugh, I can't tell
if you're lying--

387
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:28,845
you're such a good actor!

388
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:34,751
Hey, how you doing?

389
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,753
What are you
doing here?

390
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:41,858
Oh, I just came by, you know,
to see if you need any help.

391
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,826
Howard and Bernadette
asked you to check up on me.

392
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:45,862
That is not entirely true.

393
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,031
So did Leonard and... everybody.

394
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:52,168
How irresponsible
do you all think I am?

395
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,070
We don't think
you're irresponsible.

396
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,805
We think you're...

397
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:57,774
fun-loving.

398
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,210
That is just a nice word
for “irresponsible.”

399
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:04,781
Hmm. You might be more
on the ball than we thought.

400
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,118
I'm getting
a little hungry.

401
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,620
Want me to get
it this time?

402
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,555
That'd be great.

to see an annoyed blonde

walk into the room.

408
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,769
Can you get us
a little snack?

409

your spy to do it?

We trust you.
Yeah.
