1
00:00:02,187 --> 00:00:04,785
- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- <i>You're the Lord of Hell,</i>

2
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:05,834
for crying out loud.

3
00:00:05,869 --> 00:00:08,156
Shouldn't you be spending
your valuable time

4
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,692
doing something more significant?

5
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:13,232
I'm retired, Maze. I've
got nothing but time.

6
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,924
Your return to the
Underworld has been requested.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,928
Remind Dad that I quit Hell

8
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:20,541
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

9
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:22,826
<i>We should be out there
solving a homicide</i>

10
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,558
<i>and punishing those responsible.</i>

11
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:26,299
We? How could you possibly help me?

12
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:27,407
I have the ability

13
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,772
to draw out peoples' forbidden desires.

14
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:31,972
I got it. I got it. The name,

15
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:33,243
the whole Lucifer thing.

16
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:34,800
And desire is like your superpower.

17
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,445
Mm, it's more like a gift from God really.

18
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:37,933
You're thinking about it, aren't you?

19
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:39,095
See, I wouldn't recommend it.

20
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,229
I'm like walking heroin.

21
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:42,051
Ah, you're the Devil.

22
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:43,349
Mm, correct.

23
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:51,809
Give me one second.

24
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:55,957
Please. Please don't kill me.

25
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:58,300
You're gonna wish that's all I did to you.

26
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,075
<i>I just can't understand</i>

27
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,205
<i>why you would save a human life.</i>

28
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,306
Something different about her

29
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:05,555
that I don't quite
understand, and it vexes me.

30
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:07,384
Maybe it's not her that's different.

31
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:08,641
<i>Right. Here's the deal.</i>

32
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:11,155
We can have as much naked
cuddle time as you desire,

33
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,245
but you're gonna have to listen to me, too.

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,772
You know, just an existential
dilemma or two. Deal?

35
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:17,419
<i>Yes.</i>

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,007
Save your soul! It's up to you!

37
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:40,576
I ask you to repent!

38
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:43,679
Repent your sins before it is too late!

39
00:01:43,714 --> 00:01:45,788
It is the end of times!

40
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:47,393
The Devil walks among us!

41
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:51,520
Padre, you have no idea how right you are.

42
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,122
But there's no need to be angry about it.

43
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:54,390
Enjoy the ride.

44
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:55,791
Bless you.

45
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:57,626
Have you seen the face of the Devil?

46
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,662
Oh, every morning in the mirror, pal.

47
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:02,030
Exactly!

48
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,432
He's in all of us!

49
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:05,567
In our every moment of weakness.

50
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,002
Look at this world!

51
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:09,605
The sin, the lust!

52
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,773
It is the Devil's touch.

53
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:12,875
N-N-No, don't give me
credit for all that.

54
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,277
You humans do plenty all on your own.

55
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:21,817
What's your problem, pal?

56
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:23,719
Excuse me?

57
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:25,702
Yeah, uh, why don't you
move your shtick along.

58
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:26,967
Okay, I'm not sharing my tips with you,

59
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:29,391
- if that's what you're angling for.
- Oh.

60
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:31,155
Right. Is this a performance?

61
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,228
Are you like the Chewbacca and
the Spider-Man down the street?

62
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:34,963
I have to say, you're very good.

63
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:36,732
Yeah, so why don't you go bother them.

64
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:38,247
You're bad for my business.

65
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,084
Repent! The Devil...

66
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:42,909
Isn't finished with you yet.

67
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,577
You see, what I hate more
than anything is a liar,

68
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:50,952
a charlatan, someone who
doesn't believe in what they say.

69
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:53,248
So what are you gonna do about it?

70
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:56,784
Why, make you a believer, of course.

71
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:01,523
S-S... uh, stay away!

72
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,858
He's the Devil!

73
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:03,900
You don't understand!

74
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:06,534
This isn't a performance! He's the Devil!

75
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,963
He's the Devil!

76
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:09,965
It's true. It is true.

77
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,709
Yes, thanks, everyone.

78
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,711
I'm, uh, here till, well,
the end of time, actually.

79
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,741
- <i>So you're the Devil.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

80
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:24,386
Yes. Well, Satan, Beelzebub, Old Scratch.

81
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,448
Actually, I like that one in particular.

82
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:28,094
But, uh, those were the old me.

83
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:30,123
These days, you just
have plain old Lucifer.

84
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,545
And you've left Hell behind to
take a vacation in Los Angeles.

85
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,353
Well, where else would I go?

86
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:39,312
You don't seem too bothered

87
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:41,790
by my being the Prince of Darkness.

88
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:44,199
I'm willing to work within your metaphor.

89
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:45,634
Right.

90
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:47,903
Sometimes it's easier
to make intimate issues

91
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,372
about something bigger than yourself.

92
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:52,574
Well, there are few
things bigger than myself.

93
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,393
I'm well aware.

94
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,413
Ah.

95
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:02,885
Last we spoke, you were bothered
about feelings of humanity.

96
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,287
I was, yes, but I have good
news for you on that front.

97
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:06,469
I'm healed.

98
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:07,422
Is that so?

99
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,240
Yes. Yes, back to my normal, devilish self.

100
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:12,247
No pesky empathy to be found.

101
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:14,138
I'd kick a puppy if one waltzed by.

102
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,569
I'm joking. Puppies don't waltz.

103
00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:19,023
You like to hide insecurity in humor,

104
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:19,918
don't you?

105
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,476
I don't have insecurities.

106
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,632
Mm. Everyone does.

107
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:28,844
Very well. I'll play your game.

108
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:30,815
What do you think I'm insecure about?

109
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,248
That you <i>are</i> changing,

110
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:36,143
but that you don't know
what's causing the change.

111
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,045
Or who.

112
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,593
We'll pick this up next time.

113
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,803
What? Oh, very well.

114
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:46,260
A deal's a deal. Though, why do I feel

115
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,047
like you're getting more
out of our bargain than I am?

116
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:49,131
Ooh! Hello!

117
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,500
Thank you. Here.

118
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:53,902
- Donald.
- How are you, sir?

119
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:29,145
- Oh, I didn't order a drink.
- Courtesy of the owner.

120
00:05:29,254 --> 00:05:30,673
This is from Lucifer?

121
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,241
He asked me to make you
something you'd like.

122
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,151
Did I get it wrong?

123
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,944
You and Lucifer seem really close.

124
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:40,616
I followed him through the gates of Hell.

125
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:42,351
I'll take that as a "yes."

126
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,274
Hello, Detective.

127
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,677
How has your undercover surveillance

128
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:10,412
of my activities gone so far?

129
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:12,274
I've looked into you.

130
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:14,552
Your name really is Lucifer Morningstar.

131
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:17,619
And as far as I can tell, you
didn't exist five years ago.

132
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:19,154
On the earthly plane, no.

133
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:22,758
People don't appear out of thin air.

134
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:24,369
Who were you?

135
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:28,065
How did you survive getting
shot six times by Jimmy Barnes?

136
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:30,632
Is that your normal reaction
to someone saving your life?

137
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:32,470
- Investigating them?
- When I see something

138
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,508
I can't explain, yeah, I look for answers.

139
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:37,506
Well, I've given you the answer, Detective.
It's not my fault you won't accept it.

140
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,439
Do you know what I think?

141
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:40,192
I stopped trying to guess.

142
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:41,777
I think you like me.

143
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:44,590
What part of the look on my
face gives you that impression?

144
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,226
No, no, no, it's not about
the face. It's about the eyes,

145
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:48,612
what's behind them. I think you see

146
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:51,424
something that you truly desire, and you...

147
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,728
you don't know what to do with yourself,

148
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:55,090
do you?

149
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,958
Really?

150
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:58,260
Uh-huh.

151
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:02,084
- Hmm.
- That's more like it.

152
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:08,275
Detective, I never knew you cared.

153
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,138
Mm.

154
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:11,580
Ooh.

155
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,936
No bulletproof vest.

156
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,077
What?

157
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:23,494
I just couldn't imagine how you'd get it

158
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,583
under that suit, but I had to check.

159
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:27,425
What is it? What is it? What is it?

160
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,148
I'm gonna figure out your secret, Lucifer.

161
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:31,457
Not a secret if I'm telling you the answer!

162
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,695
It's...

163
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,024
Why don't I affect you, Detective?

164
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:37,799
What makes you different?

165
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:39,935
I guess we both have our mysteries.

166
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,471
Ah. Well, I'll show you
mine if you show me yours.

167
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:45,607
Oh, God, not that again.

168
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:47,278
Decker.

169
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:50,612
Are you sure?

170
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:51,747
Yes.

171
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:54,182
Yes, um, please send me the address.

172
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:56,079
I... I owe you one.

173
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:58,770
Oh, finally.

174
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:01,414
Now <i>that</i> affected you. What was it?

175
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:04,094
Detective?

176
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:06,461
Detective?!

177
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:13,435
Come on. Active scene.

178
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,778
The victim was being
followed by a paparazzo.

179
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:22,811
Tried to lose his tail.

180
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,513
Instead, lost control of his car.

181
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,024
Died on impact.

182
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:27,885
The paparazzo following him was...?

183
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:29,918
Was Nick Hofmeister, yeah.

184
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,021
Who's the victim?

185
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,091
Robbie Russell Jr.

186
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,192
The son of the movie star?

187
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,624
He wasn't in the business, was he?

188
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,828
Didn't stop everyone from
wanting pictures of him.

189
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:42,983
They're vultures.

190
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:44,633
You get a statement from Nick?

191
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:48,103
You can't be involved in an active
case until you're off medical leave.

192
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:52,073
Listen, I get why you
wanted to be here, I do.

193
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,409
But you have to bring him?

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,316
You've got to be kidding me.

195
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,278
What are you doing here?

196
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,383
Oh! How's your ex?

197
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:07,128
He's not the reason you
rushed over here, is he?

198
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:08,427
Answer the question.

199
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:10,354
I'm trying to solve my mystery, Detective.

200
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,641
If I don't affect you, I'm
curious as to what does.

201
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:17,851
Oh, and I think I've just found my answer.

202
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:18,917
Who's that?

203
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,202
He's a paparazzo.

204
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,120
Oh. Had a little run-in with him

205
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:25,092
during your <i>Hot Tub High School</i>
days, did you? Huh? Is that it?

206
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,974
Yeah, you could say that. He's a cockroach.

207
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,025
But he'll figure a way out
of this. He always does.

208
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,846
You want to talk to him, don't you?

209
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,681
Well, go on, then. What's stopping you?

210
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,182
The rules? Huh?

211
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:35,450
Detective Douche?

212
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:37,602
If you desire something, just take it.

213
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:39,487
Lucifer, what are you doing?

214
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,424
Hello.

215
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,645
You finally did it, Nick.

216
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:49,113
You finally wanted a photo so
bad that you killed someone.

217
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,265
You're not gonna get away with this.

218
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,944
I'm gonna make sure of it.

219
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,468
You're right.

220
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:54,479
- Say that again?
- You're right.

221
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:56,918
I went too far. I'll confess.

222
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:58,408
Okay.

223
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:01,503
Maybe he's less cockroach,
more dung beetle?

224
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,208
Police work always this easy?

225
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:04,316
No. That's the problem.

226
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:06,775
Right. Well, do you mind
if I give it a whirl?

227
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,184
Tell me, dung beetle,

228
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:11,753
what is it you desire?

229
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:17,292
I... would like to confess.

230
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:19,030
Yes, yes, yes, but why?

231
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:20,386
Because I deserve it.

232
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,064
I've just done...

233
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:25,267
...so many terrible things, you know?

234
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:27,525
I see it as my chance to-to...

235
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:28,855
Chance to what?

236
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:30,714
No. I...

237
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,630
I... If I tell you,

238
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,845
- he's just gonna... No. Just...
- He? Who?

239
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,810
Would you please make him stop?

240
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,058
- Who? He who?
- Him.

241
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:37,869
- Tell him.
- What are you hiding?

242
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,721
- What are you doing? Hey.
- You said "he." Who?

243
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:42,092
Neither one of you are supposed
to be here. Especially you.

244
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:43,318
Come on.

245
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:45,692
All right. Temper, temper.

246
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:50,492
Right. Well, that's done.

247
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:52,193
No.

248
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:53,576
If Nick's covering for someone,

249
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,346
that means the real
murderer is still out there.

250
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:57,465
Yes, plenty of murderers
are out there, Detective.

251
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:00,030
You heard the man. He
deserves the punishment.

252
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:01,937
At least he's getting it.

253
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:03,705
But that's not enough for you, is it?

254
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,140
You hate that dung beetle.

255
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:07,575
Are you really gonna try
and prove his innocence?

256
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,578
I'm gonna find out who
really killed this kid.

257
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,403
So that's a yes.

258
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,915
Wow, aren't you full of surprises.

259
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:19,587
Well, where do we begin?

260
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,604
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

261
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,821
You think Nick Hofmeister is innocent? You?

262
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:42,490
He confessed, Dan.

263
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,026
Nick wouldn't confess to a parking ticket,

264
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:44,925
let alone a murder.

265
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,707
It just sounded like

266
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:48,296
- he was covering for someone.
- So wait.

267
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,777
First he confessed, then
he told you he didn't do it?

268
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:53,050
Well, he didn't want to.

269
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:54,518
You know, Lucifer, um...

270
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:56,636
...made him.

271
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:58,172
Do I even want to know what that means?

272
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:00,853
Look, he was about to tell us more
before you came and took him away, Dan.

273
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,510
You know what, his car is at the scene.

274
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:04,201
- He confessed.
- I know.

275
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:05,846
Is this the fight that you want to pick?

276
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:07,858
Just promise me you'll look into it.

277
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,450
I'll do my job.

278
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:11,311
- Go home.
- Okay.

279
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:13,685
And take your weird
club-owner sidekick with you

280
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,551
- before I arrest him.
- For what?

281
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:18,252
Let's start with smoking
pot at a crime scene.

282
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:21,595
Uh, sorry, do you want a hit?

283
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:22,926
N-No.

284
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:25,262
It's "puff, puff, pass," not
"puff, puff, stomp angrily."

285
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:26,990
You brought pot to a crime scene?

286
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,512
I most certainly did not.

287
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,356
I found it here.

288
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,548
You found it?

289
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,837
You found it here at a crime scene?

290
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:33,550
Yes, in the dung beetle's car.

291
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:34,964
You smoked evidence?

292
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,410
Well, it would've gone to waste otherwise.

293
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:38,713
That's really good stuff you
just ground under your heel.

294
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:41,980
Wow.

295
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,595
Any sign he'd recently lit up?

296
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,459
Well, there was a... a
roach from another joint,

297
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:46,554
freshly smoked.

298
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:47,922
Nick's pupils weren't dilated.

299
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:49,457
He didn't seem high.

300
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:51,317
Maybe he wasn't alone. Where's the roach?

301
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:52,893
Well, I added it to my joint.

302
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:55,936
Well, it's the best part.

303
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:58,385
So our only evidence is
currently in your lungs?

304
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,002
Uh, you really wanted to say
"up in smoke" then, didn't you?

305
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:03,698
No. No, I most definitely did not.

306
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:04,846
Right, so what should we do now?

307
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:06,013
I mean, we could head back to Lux.

308
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,211
I'm sure there's some stragglers

309
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,210
we could get into trouble with, huh?

310
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:11,401
I'm good, thanks.

311
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:13,047
More for me, then.

312
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:45,369
Hello, old friend.

313
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,591
Bloody hell.

314
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,623
Brother, I'm disappointed in you.

315
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:57,591
What?

316
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,511
It's called a devil's
threesome for a reason.

317
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:01,462
You were once the brightest of

318
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:03,685
all of God's angels, Lucifer.

319
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,833
And now, look at you.

320
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:08,494
Look, if you've come to lecture
me, can you just save it for later?

321
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,045
I'm annoyingly sober right now,

322
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,959
and it takes ages to pour
a drink when you're around.

323
00:14:11,994 --> 00:14:14,041
- Actually, I'm here with an offer.
- Really?

324
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:16,310
Go back to Hell, Lucifer,
and I will speak to Father.

325
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:18,943
You're scared, aren't you?
That if I don't go back to Hell,

326
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:20,338
you're gonna have to take over.

327
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:21,785
Oh, that would never happen.

328
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,526
Oh, no, no, I mean, it's not
like God sent his favorite son

329
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,257
to reign over Hell before, is it?

330
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,999
Oh, wait, sorry.

331
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:29,345
Forgot.

332
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:30,729
So you can take your ultimatum

333
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:32,897
and shove it up your feathered hole.

334
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:41,935
You can't see it yet, can you?

335
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,939
- What's that?
- You saved a human life, Luci.

336
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,980
And not for any selfish reasons.

337
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:50,678
No, you did it simply because
you cared about that detective.

338
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:56,630
Your time here on Earth is
affecting you, dear brother.

339
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:59,785
- You're changing.
- My life is change.

340
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:02,289
"The same thing over and
over," that's your boring motto.

341
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:05,612
True, but usually you're the
one controlling the change.

342
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:08,596
This time, you're not.

343
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:11,031
Now, does that scare you?

344
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,399
Because it should.

345
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:16,239
You know, I am tired of your
dire warnings, all right?

346
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:20,288
So just go rattle your
saber in someone else's face.

347
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:24,078
You think about my offer.

348
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:28,137
When you've made a decision,
you know how to find me.

349
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,304
Hey, Robbie, where you been?

350
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:52,648
If you're gonna follow me,

351
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:54,650
maybe I can do something good with this.

352
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:58,474
This... is the Web site for the Red Cross.

353
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:00,577
Give blood, volunteer.

354
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,912
Don't be like the asshat filming this.

355
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,216
Good job, kid.

356
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,331
Better than I did.

357
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,954
- Mommy?
- Yeah, baby?

358
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:08,700
Are you looking at a no-no site?

359
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,006
No. Why would you think that?

360
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,423
Because you put it away so fast,

361
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:14,652
and you look really, really guilty.

362
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,335
No, baby, I'm just doing police work.

363
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,098
I thought you weren't
supposed to be working.

364
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,704
And I thought you were
supposed to be getting ready

365
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:22,303
to hang out with your dad.

366
00:16:22,338 --> 00:16:24,705
Who is early, apparently.

367
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:28,825
Do you really live here?

368
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,828
I thought I must have
gotten the wrong address.

369
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:32,813
How do you afford this place?

370
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:33,989
Do you take bribes?

371
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,051
I don't. And what are you doing here?

372
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:36,850
Lucifer!

373
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:39,520
Ah, hello again, small human.

374
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:42,960
Uh, this-this is yours, yes?

375
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,653
Yeah, that's Molly McDowell.

376
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:46,312
She's a ballerina by day,

377
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:47,961
but a ninja chemist by night.

378
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:49,624
When a simple yes would've sufficed.

379
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,191
Right, on you go, then. Go on, fetch away.

380
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:54,408
Well, go on, then.

381
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:56,085
Uh, is this too advanced for her?

382
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,005
You're funny.

383
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,476
Trixie, babe, come on.

384
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:02,369
Get ready.

385
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:04,636
You need to leave now.

386
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:07,474
I had no idea that <i>Hot Tub
High School</i> paid so well.

387
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:10,017
It didn't. And can you
shh on the <i>Hot Tub?</i>

388
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:11,077
She doesn't know.

389
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:12,752
What, that her mom was a giant star?

390
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:14,053
Why not?

391
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:16,538
Not 'cause of the old...?

392
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:18,489
Yeah. And can you never do that again?

393
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:21,400
Right, sorry. So how do
you afford this place?

394
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:23,017
I don't; it's my mother's.

395
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:26,180
I moved in after Dan and I separated, okay?

396
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:28,595
Penelope Decker?

397
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,808
Hold on a minute.

398
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:31,557
Your mother's Penelope Decker?

399
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,407
- Queen of '80s cheeseball sci-fi?
- Yeah.

400
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,743
You have to introduce me.

401
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,512
Mm, I don't.

402
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:38,931
- And I probably won't.
- So you're part of a

403
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,513
family dynasty like me. No
wonder we get on so well.

404
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:42,748
How did you rebel?

405
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:44,666
- What do you mean?
- Well, you're mad at the dung beetle.

406
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:47,447
You must have done something
salacious in your youth.

407
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:48,288
What was it?

408
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:49,723
Did you kiss a girl and like it?

409
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,240
I don't want to talk about it.

410
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:52,739
Oh, so there is something.

411
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:53,560
Two girls?

412
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:55,468
- Okay.
- An Eiffel Tower?

413
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,124
What's an Eiffel Tower?

414
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,968
It's marvelous. It's
when two chaps high-five

415
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,124
at the top, then the young lady...

416
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,065
Okay, there is an
eight-year-old in the room

417
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:04,568
who doesn't need to hear
about an Eiffel Tower.

418
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:06,436
What...? What about the case?

419
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:09,043
If I were secretly working
on it, having you around

420
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:10,971
drawing attention
wouldn't be good, would it?

421
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:13,165
Well, maybe not, but be much
more fun, wouldn't it, Detective,

422
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,020
if we carried on working together?

423
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:16,821
Detective?

424
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:19,153
Detective?

425
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:20,477
Mm-hmm.

426
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,199
I understand.

427
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,458
Mm-hmm.

428
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:25,463
Hello, there.

429
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,917
I'd very much like to see Nick Hofmeister.

430
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:31,012
I'm afraid I can't... Oh.

431
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:33,567
Hello.

432
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,699
Hello to you.

433
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:35,531
Hello?

434
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,916
Afternoon, dung beetle.

435
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:45,835
We need to talk.

436
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:49,643
I, um, I'm not gonna
tell you anything, man.

437
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,257
No, no, no, I don't want
to know about the case,

438
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:54,548
so you can keep your dirty little secrets.

439
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:57,468
No, I'd like to know about Chloe Decker.

440
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:00,827
And you're gonna tell me everything.

441
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,391
I have an effect on people.

442
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:08,781
It's a way of pulling out

443
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:12,175
their deepest desires,
revealing the truth within.

444
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,840
It works on everyone.

445
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,420
Everyone except for Chloe Decker.

446
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:17,611
And I suspect it's somehow related

447
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:19,457
to my recent bouts of humanity.

448
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:20,762
What does this have to do with me?

449
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:22,269
Well, you know everything
about her, don't you?

450
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,944
All her sordid secrets.

451
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:25,285
I'm hoping they'll help me understand

452
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,060
why she's so frustratingly
immune to my charms.

453
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:30,246
Chloe doesn't have any sordid secrets.

454
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:35,391
I've seen the hatred in her
eyes when she looks at you.

455
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:37,909
Come on. You must have something.

456
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,777
Do you know what happened when she was 19?

457
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:41,307
She starred in <i>Hot Tub High School</i>

458
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:44,047
and revealed her rather
spectacular assets to the world.

459
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,883
Right.

460
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,140
And two weeks later, her father died.

461
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:51,014
Oh.

462
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,675
Yeah, so I knew, of course,

463
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,307
everyone in the world was gonna try to get

464
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:57,275
a... shot of them leaving the funeral.

465
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,553
And I really... I really
wanted to be first.

466
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:02,731
Oh, dung beetle, tell me you didn't.

467
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,686
Yeah, I crashed the funeral.

468
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:08,061
And... she... oh, she flipped out.

469
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:09,507
But I got my photo.

470
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,926
Right when she punched the lens.

471
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,886
I mean, right then... it
cracked the lens right in half.

472
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:16,314
- I made so much money off that photo.
- I'm sure.

473
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:23,400
Yeah, but at what cost to my soul, right?

474
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,444
And that'll be for someone else to decide.

475
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:28,562
Yeah.

476
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:30,442
Well, that someone else
is sitting opposite you,

477
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:32,052
and it's not looking good.

478
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:33,498
I crossed a line.

479
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:34,630
And I knew it.

480
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:36,229
And after that, I just
did everything I could

481
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:38,608
to keep others from making
the same mistakes I did.

482
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,276
That's why I...

483
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,708
Why what?

484
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,501
- No, it's...
- You want to tell me.

485
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,848
- It's nothing.
- Who are you protecting

486
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:48,796
- from following in your footsteps?
- I can't.

487
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:51,894
- It's... I just... I can't.
- You want to tell me, don't you?

488
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:53,661
- I really can't.
- You want to tell me.

489
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:54,810
Who are you protecting?

490
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:55,822
Who are you protecting?

491
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,358
How are you doing this, man?

492
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:58,698
Look at me.

493
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,191
Who are you protecting?

494
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,212
Please, just...

495
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:02,960
- Look at me. Look at me.
- I won't. I won't.

496
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,362
- I can't.
- Look at me!

497
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,830
Leave me alone!

498
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,687
I already spoke to the police about Robbie.

499
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,411
I don't know what else there is to say.

500
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,714
I'm just following up.

501
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,049
I want to make sure there aren't
any suspects we overlooked.

502
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,518
But I was told Nick Hofmeister confessed.

503
00:21:28,536 --> 00:21:29,935
He did.

504
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:35,174
Mr. Russell, I, um...

505
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:37,873
I don't think Nick killed your son.

506
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:39,497
What?

507
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,217
Are you... Is this a joke?

508
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,167
I'm sorry.

509
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,711
Y-You just don't know

510
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:51,007
what Robbie went through
because of my work.

511
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:53,891
Now he's dead because of me.

512
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:55,046
No.

513
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,017
You know, my mom is Penelope Decker.

514
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:00,084
So I was followed by paparazzi all my life,

515
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,019
just like Robbie.

516
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,085
But, you know, that wasn't my mom's fault.

517
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,574
And you got to know, it's
not your fault either.

518
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,792
The only person you can blame

519
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,946
is whoever ran your son off the road.

520
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:12,451
I want to make sure we get the right guy.

521
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:15,287
And I'm telling you, I
don't think Nick is him.

522
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:19,203
There was one other paparazzo.

523
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,001
Did you get a name or a description?

524
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:21,714
No, I didn't.

525
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:24,154
Because Robbie only noticed him once.

526
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:26,589
That's why I never mentioned him before.

527
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:29,013
Thank you.

528
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,550
Excuse me.

529
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,522
Decker.

530
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,058
He did what?

531
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:51,469
What is wrong with you?

532
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,217
Nothing is wrong with me.

533
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:56,511
I was hoping for sexy, salacious details,

534
00:22:56,546 --> 00:23:00,047
and instead I got taken on
a trip down depression lane.

535
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:04,875
You feel bad for invading her privacy?

536
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,310
You're the Lord of Hell.

537
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,744
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but Amenadiel is right.

538
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:12,911
You are changing.

539
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:15,159
I don't mind the odd
smart-assed remark, Maze.

540
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:16,252
They can be quite amusing.

541
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:18,710
But don't you dare disrespect me.

542
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,448
Or what?

543
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:22,203
You'll cry really hard on my shoulder?

544
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:24,605
You will not speak to me this way!

545
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,340
There he is.

546
00:23:31,596 --> 00:23:34,435
How did you get into Nick's holding cell?

547
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,214
And there he goes.

548
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,415
Oh, sorry.

549
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:40,573
Am I interrupting some
creepy foreplay you two have?

550
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:42,797
How did you get into Nick's holding cell?

551
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:44,589
Why, by asking very nicely, of course.

552
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:46,141
Something you should try sometime.

553
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:49,227
This case has nothing to do with you.

554
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,588
Why won't you leave it alone?

555
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:52,243
Why won't you?

556
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:54,498
Did you learn something, at least?

557
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,635
Yes. I did, actually.

558
00:23:57,774 --> 00:23:59,178
Our dung beetle is protecting

559
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:02,235
someone who's following in his footsteps.

560
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:03,642
Protégé, perhaps.

561
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:05,615
I found out someone else
was following Robbie,

562
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,484
and someone's been uploading photos online

563
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,752
today from Nick's company.

564
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,383
Last one was posted an hour ago

565
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:13,985
from a party that's still happening.

566
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,717
Our killer could be there.

567
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,272
Right.

568
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,390
Are you coming or what?

569
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,465
Oh, sorry, I thought this was
the part where you leave me behind

570
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,064
and say something like, "Lucifer, stay.

571
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,686
- Good devil."
- I'd rather keep my eye on you.

572
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:45,949
So how do you plan on catching
our murderous protégé anyway?

573
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,830
Well, I was thinking, what if he
never left the scene of the crime?

574
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:52,264
What, and instead blended in with
the other paparazzi taking photos?

575
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:53,997
That's quite clever.

576
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:57,767
Yeah, so if we recognize anyone
from the crash, it could be our guy.

577
00:24:57,802 --> 00:24:59,295
Right.

578
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:03,434
Are you okay?

579
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,835
I'm fine.

580
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,638
Why?

581
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:09,952
Oh, Nick told you what happened, didn't he?

582
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:11,163
He did.

583
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:13,744
Got to hear all about
your wicked right hook.

584
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:15,005
Oh, yeah.

585
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,207
He also told me it was a low point for him.

586
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:19,254
Which I believe, actually.

587
00:25:19,372 --> 00:25:21,585
Yeah, I think our dung
beetle, of all things,

588
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,621
desires redemption for what he did to you.

589
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,958
Yeah, well, he's not going
about it the right way,

590
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:29,308
- that's for sure.
- Yes, well, we all know

591
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:32,269
what the road to Hell
is paved with, don't we?

592
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:34,927
Hello, hello, hello.

593
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:36,859
There's a familiar face.

594
00:25:36,984 --> 00:25:39,603
Yeah, from the crime scene this morning.

595
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:42,923
- I remember him.
- And he's spectacularly creepy as well,

596
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,749
so that's a bonus.

597
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:45,830
Hey, everybody, it's Chloe Decker!

598
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:47,078
Penelope Decker's daughter!

599
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,881
- Chloe, look over here!
- Guys...

600
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:50,819
- Back off.
- Chloe Decker!

601
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:52,901
- Hey, show me your boobs!
- Hey, show us your boobs, Chloe!

602
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:55,436
Back off, you mouth-breathing scaven...!

603
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,686
Well, go on then, punch him!
Come on, let's punch them all!

604
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:00,507
It's not me anymore.

605
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:03,828
Well, it's still very much me.

606
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:05,196
You, Friar Tuck,

607
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,823
tell me, is this depravity
really all you want out of life?

608
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,433
Hmm?

609
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:14,323
I want to win a Pulitzer for photography.

610
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:15,373
Pulitzer?

611
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,782
Really? Do you hear that, chaps?

612
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:20,334
Yeah, they don't give out
Pulitzers for nip slips.

613
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:36,423
He's gone.

614
00:26:43,911 --> 00:26:45,710
Oh, boy.

615
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,055
It's not that bad, is it?

616
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:50,353
Trixie's classmates all have the Internet.

617
00:26:50,388 --> 00:26:51,860
One of them's gonna
figure out that her mom is

618
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:54,082
the top story on their
favorite gossip site.

619
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:57,192
She's finally gonna find out
about <i>Hot Tub High School.</i>

620
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:58,725
- Great.
- If it's any consolation,

621
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,976
you look really good in it.

622
00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:01,544
Thanks.

623
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:05,589
Why do I feel like you're
cheering me up for even worse news?

624
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:07,199
Nick's sticking to his story.

625
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:08,474
It's an open-
and-shut case,

626
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:11,314
but I can't help it if a rogue detective

627
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:13,550
won't leave well enough alone.

628
00:27:15,776 --> 00:27:17,262
Oh, you ran the plate number I gave you.

629
00:27:17,297 --> 00:27:18,406
Yes, ma'am, I did.

630
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,633
It was registered to Nick...
one of his company cars.

631
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:22,526
Like the one that ran Robbie off the road?

632
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:23,479
Exactly.

633
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:24,337
Did a little more digging.

634
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:27,936
Guy's name is Josh Bryant.
He freelances for Nick.

635
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:29,437
Thanks.

636
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:33,217
Why are you doing this?

637
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,224
Because I think you're onto something.

638
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:38,641
So go figure it out
while I buy you some time.

639
00:27:38,676 --> 00:27:41,120
And... be careful.

640
00:27:41,155 --> 00:27:42,762
All right?

641
00:27:57,305 --> 00:28:00,806
Oh, sorry. Did I ruin
your creepy little moment?

642
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:05,598
I am so happy to see you.

643
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:08,117
I felt so bad about what happened.

644
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:09,438
I'm a huge fan.

645
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:11,803
<i>Hot Tub High School</i>
was my favorite growing up.

646
00:28:11,838 --> 00:28:12,876
Yes, we're really not interested

647
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:15,040
in your formative spank
bank years, all right?

648
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,802
I'm so sorry about what happened.

649
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:19,237
I would've done something,
but I'm not good with violence.

650
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:19,859
Mm.

651
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:22,040
Well, lucky for us, we found you anyhow.

652
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,582
You were looking for me? Why?

653
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,256
Because she wants justice
for Robbie Russell Jr.

654
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,694
What is it you want, Josh?

655
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:30,949
Hmm?

656
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:32,926
To be first.

657
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:34,770
To always be first.

658
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:36,271
Really?

659
00:28:37,564 --> 00:28:39,190
What, did Nick teach you that?

660
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:40,759
To be first?

661
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,895
Yeah. I learned a lot working for him.

662
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:44,162
He's my idol.

663
00:28:44,197 --> 00:28:45,438
He's the best pap out there.

664
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:48,778
So you took photos of your
idol being arrested for murder?

665
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:50,742
I didn't know what else to do.

666
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,306
Other than what Nick would've done.

667
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:54,107
Which is to be first, no matter what.

668
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:55,533
Of course.

669
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,275
Just a second.

670
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:07,845
You like smoking pot, Josh?

671
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,689
It's for my nerves. I have a prescription.

672
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:14,459
Oh!

673
00:29:14,494 --> 00:29:15,360
Hello.

674
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,269
Good timing on that photo.

675
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,701
Just lucky I guess.

676
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:29,307
Far be it for me to call someone's
morality into question, but...

677
00:29:29,343 --> 00:29:32,310
I believe that photo was planned.

678
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:34,796
Yeah.

679
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:37,664
Makes me wonder what else was.

680
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:41,519
Look at this.

681
00:29:41,555 --> 00:29:43,262
Celebrity shouting matches,

682
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:44,355
fistfights.

683
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,766
Josh had the first photo on every one.

684
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:47,926
It escalates.

685
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:49,348
Overdose. Suicide.

686
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:50,819
- Or so it appeared.
- Well, I suppose

687
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:53,485
the best way to be first is to
know it'll happen beforehand.

688
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,468
So he follows Robbie, intent
on running him off the road,

689
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,604
but doesn't count on his
own car running off as well.

690
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,339
This is cold, premeditated murder.

691
00:30:01,374 --> 00:30:02,711
- Mm.
- Nick's a slimeball.

692
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:05,377
I just... I don't think he'd go this far.

693
00:30:05,485 --> 00:30:07,616
Which means Josh maybe
convinced him to take the fall.

694
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:08,885
The question is: why?

695
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,148
Well, who cares?

696
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,442
We know Josh is guilty. Let's punish him.

697
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:15,230
Ah, I could add an ironic twist,
like I used to when I ran Hell.

698
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:16,861
Yeah, no, it doesn't work that way,

699
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:18,024
because I need evidence.

700
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,558
Well, you have plenty.

701
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:20,762
Circumstantial.

702
00:30:20,797 --> 00:30:22,853
I need concrete proof.

703
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:23,729
I'm gonna talk to Nick...

704
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:25,227
Boring, boring, boring, boring!

705
00:30:25,262 --> 00:30:27,358
You don't decide who gets punished and how.

706
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:30,368
- That's exactly what I do.
- No, no, you don't.

707
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:32,744
This is how it works, Lucifer.

708
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,271
Whatever speech you have brewing, Maze,

709
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:44,907
I don't want to hear it.

710
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:48,221
I think I've said everything I need to.

711
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:52,220
You're right.

712
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:53,728
And I agree.

713
00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:55,760
Let's go deliver some punishment.

714
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:04,709
We believe Josh may be a
very disturbed individual.

715
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,939
God.

716
00:31:07,974 --> 00:31:09,659
He caused all these?

717
00:31:09,694 --> 00:31:11,952
Yeah. All of them.

718
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:13,979
I can't believe it. I...

719
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,621
Tell me what really happened, Nick.

720
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,332
I took Josh in when he was 16.

721
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:23,822
He was a runaway.

722
00:31:23,857 --> 00:31:27,582
He was a little broken.

723
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:32,530
In him, I saw a little
bit of who I used to be.

724
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:35,734
At least, I thought I did.

725
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,569
So I took him under my wing.

726
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,038
He was a natural.

727
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:42,783
Taught him about all the
lines a pap can't cross.

728
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,564
You know, 'cause I just...
I just wanted him to stop

729
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,600
making the same mistakes I did.

730
00:31:47,714 --> 00:31:50,313
- Mm.
- And then, two days ago,

731
00:31:50,382 --> 00:31:52,915
he calls me up, says he's
been in a really bad accident,

732
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,083
and said that he totally understood

733
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:57,485
everything I was saying now.

734
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,388
But it was too late.

735
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:01,770
You know, someone was dead.

736
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:02,990
So you took the fall,

737
00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:06,214
hoping that Josh would
get a chance at a new life.

738
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,416
Yeah.

739
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:11,036
Nick Hofmeister finally tries to
do something good with his life,

740
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:13,438
and he gets played.

741
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:15,398
You must really be enjoying this.

742
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:17,266
I'm really not.

743
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:21,111
Believe it or not, I forgive you.

744
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:23,246
This isn't about you, this isn't about me.

745
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:24,816
This is about Robbie Russell.

746
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:27,470
You know, he was a kid who
didn't ask to be famous.

747
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:31,183
He just wanted to live a normal life.

748
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:36,105
Nick, if you don't testify,
Josh will do this again.

749
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,830
He'll do it again.

750
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:43,802
Excuse me.

751
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,258
Oh. Just a second.

752
00:32:47,094 --> 00:32:48,257
Hey, Dan, this better be important.

753
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:50,290
I think Nick's about to talk.

754
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:54,746
No, I'm not following Josh. Why?

755
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:56,900
What do you mean he's missing?

756
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:06,015
Desk Sergeant?

757
00:33:06,145 --> 00:33:07,918
- Yes, Detective?
- Where did Nick Hofmeister go?

758
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,915
- Did somebody get him?
- Why, yes.

759
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:12,548
It was that tall, handsome British fella.

760
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:17,345
Oh, no. I did it, too, didn't I?

761
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:43,071
Oh, I respect what you do, dung beetle.

762
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,764
Much as celebrities hate you,

763
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,401
you know, they need you,
keep you in the limelight.

764
00:33:48,645 --> 00:33:51,346
You're a... a necessarily evil.

765
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:53,835
Something I understand all too well.

766
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,361
But the-the trouble is
that you tried to change.

767
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,831
Yeah? And you failed spectacularly at it.

768
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,525
Because, well, sometimes
we are what we are,

769
00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:06,630
and we should embrace that.

770
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,776
What are we doing back here exactly?

771
00:34:10,811 --> 00:34:12,067
And do you need me to...?

772
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,002
Maze!

773
00:34:14,935 --> 00:34:17,469
Did you bring me my gift?

774
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,769
I'll kill you, you crazy bitch.

775
00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:36,230
Just be polite to the lady.

776
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:38,467
She isn't your enemy tonight.

777
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:41,847
What is this?

778
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:45,909
Right, well, both of you have committed
terrible acts worthy of punishment.

779
00:34:45,944 --> 00:34:48,436
However, you will not receive
said punishment when you die.

780
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:50,841
It's my fault, really. Sorry.

781
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,891
So I'm here to fix that.

782
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,760
Right now.

783
00:34:57,419 --> 00:34:59,156
Oh. Amateurs.

784
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:01,612
All right, very well, in
terms you'll understand.

785
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,324
You both get a gun.

786
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:08,188
Let's see who shoots who first.

787
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:17,003
What's to stop us from shooting you?

788
00:35:17,038 --> 00:35:20,053
Well, despite the waste
of bullets, let's see.

789
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,483
He's about to rat you out to the police.

790
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:26,308
And he tricked you into taking
the fall for a murder he committed.

791
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:27,776
Discuss.

792
00:35:29,748 --> 00:35:32,014
You really did it, didn't you?

793
00:35:32,954 --> 00:35:34,653
You killed people.

794
00:35:37,196 --> 00:35:38,874
You lost your touch, Nick.

795
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,821
All this talk about lines we can't cross.

796
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,758
Nowadays, the only way to be first

797
00:35:43,794 --> 00:35:46,428
is to realize that there <i>is</i> no line.

798
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:50,665
And you were almost
begging to take the fall.

799
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:52,769
That one dramatic gesture.

800
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:55,270
As if that would erase the fact
that you've been a piece of crap

801
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:57,305
- for the last 30 years.
- You can't do this.

802
00:35:57,395 --> 00:35:59,628
I treated you like a son.

803
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:06,181
Oh, Maze, you fiend.

804
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:07,965
Even I didn't see that one coming.

805
00:36:08,025 --> 00:36:10,304
You really would've killed me.

806
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,094
Nick...

807
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:21,496
I made a mistake, okay? I realize that now.

808
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:22,950
And I'm sorry.

809
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,667
Stop! Don't shoot him!

810
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,370
Detective, you're
interrupting my punishment.

811
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,654
You, don't talk. You're lucky
I figured out your insane,

812
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,528
ironic punishment before anyone got killed.

813
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:35,411
Nick, you tried to do some good,

814
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:37,134
to help someone. Don't throw it all away.

815
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:39,684
Nick, embrace who you really
are. Stop fighting it. Come on.

816
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,304
Don't listen to him,
Nick. You tried to change.

817
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:43,639
Yeah.

818
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:45,049
- And look what happened.
- Yeah.

819
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:46,819
You screwed up, but you
know what? It's okay.

820
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:48,926
You tried to change.
That's what's important.

821
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:50,994
Humans.

822
00:36:51,215 --> 00:36:53,716
Fascinating, aren't they?

823
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:56,002
Do you know, perhaps
they're onto something.

824
00:36:56,054 --> 00:36:59,252
Nick... don't.

825
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,818
I was surprised to hear from you, Lucifer.

826
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:19,754
Well, not as surprised as I was.

827
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,956
But I wanted to tell you you were right.

828
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,160
Hmm. Is that a joke?

829
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:26,244
No, I wish it were.

830
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,397
But, no, you were right, and I was wrong.

831
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:35,150
So you'll return to Hell?

832
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:37,172
What? No!

833
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:38,796
That is absurd.

834
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:41,143
No, you're right that I've
changed in my time here,

835
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:44,158
and that I have absolutely
no control over it.

836
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:46,530
And you know what?

837
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,336
That feels positively thrilling.

838
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,890
You asked me here to tell me that?

839
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:56,211
No, no, no, I thought

840
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,782
I'd use you to remedy a
situation that I've mishandled,

841
00:37:58,872 --> 00:38:01,439
and annoy you in the process.

842
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,827
Kill two birds with one
prayer sort of thing, hmm?

843
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:06,634
Luci...

844
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,536
you should've taken the offer.

845
00:38:08,572 --> 00:38:11,239
Oh.

846
00:38:26,323 --> 00:38:28,642
You're looking for someone?

847
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:33,061
But...

848
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:34,896
you were just over there.

849
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:38,406
That's... that's impossible.

850
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,684
Yes?

851
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:00,823
I saw Nick pull the trigger.

852
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:03,489
I heard the gunshot, but Josh wasn't shot.

853
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:05,920
Did you put blanks in the guns? Like...

854
00:39:05,955 --> 00:39:08,393
Was this some staged thing to
get a confession out of Josh?

855
00:39:08,428 --> 00:39:11,086
That's probably more plausible
to you than my angelic brother

856
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,337
slowing time while I pluck
a bullet out of thin air,

857
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,701
isn't it?

858
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,237
Even with all that,

859
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,706
you were standing right in front of me.

860
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:23,109
I blink, and you're here.

861
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:24,911
Is there a question there, Detective?

862
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,282
You...

863
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:29,367
You know exactly what I'm asking you.

864
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:31,938
And you know exactly what I'll answer.

865
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,387
You know, um...

866
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,063
it's quite fun, this
police malarkey, isn't it?

867
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:41,027
Are we going to watch a movie, Mommy?

868
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:43,429
No, babe, I just wanted to
talk to you about something.

869
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,632
So, before I was a cop,

870
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,669
I was an actress.

871
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:50,390
And I was in a movie.

872
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:53,607
And... it was this movie.

873
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:58,070
In the movie, I do some very silly things.

874
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:59,777
Things that, uh,

875
00:39:59,812 --> 00:40:03,018
maybe some of your friends
might tease you about.

876
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,320
But it is what it is,

877
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:08,430
and-and that's not me anymore, okay?

878
00:40:09,636 --> 00:40:10,923
I know.

879
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:11,958
Hmm?

880
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,575
I've seen this before, Mommy.

881
00:40:15,403 --> 00:40:17,400
You have? Where?

882
00:40:17,435 --> 00:40:20,271
I have the Internet.

883
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:21,832
Oh, right.

884
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:25,102
This isn't even in HD.

885
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,241
Mm. Hmm.

886
00:40:29,112 --> 00:40:31,032
Well, what'd you think?

887
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:33,410
I thought it's hilarious!

888
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:34,914
You did?

889
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:36,985
My favorite part is when
you ate too much cake,

890
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:39,452
and then you puked in that cute guy's hair.

891
00:40:40,892 --> 00:40:42,984
That part is really funny.

892
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,817
Then you stop, and we think it's all over.

893
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:48,037
Yeah.

894
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:49,512
But then...

895
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:51,564
- Blah! Blah!
- Oh.

896
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:55,346
Sorry, Mommy.

897
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:56,616
Didn't mean to hurt you.

898
00:40:56,694 --> 00:40:59,095
You didn't hurt me, baby. I'm fine.

899
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,004
It's gonna get better soon.

900
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:03,637
I hope the guy who hurt
you got in lots of trouble.

901
00:41:03,696 --> 00:41:06,484
You know, I should go see him.

902
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,749
So, the Devil did a good deed today.

903
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:11,250
Oh. Hmm.

904
00:41:11,323 --> 00:41:13,325
There's no need to call it that.

905
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,986
I enjoyed every minute of it.

906
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:18,289
You know what I mean.

907
00:41:18,553 --> 00:41:19,952
Mm.

908
00:41:20,018 --> 00:41:23,419
You know, I'm so very used to
being in control of everything.

909
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:26,832
Not knowing what's gonna come next is...

910
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,634
Can be scary.

911
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,671
No. No, I'm finding it
quite exhilarating, actually.

912
00:41:31,731 --> 00:41:33,239
Hmm.

913
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:35,974
I think you were right, by the way.

914
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:37,091
About what?

915
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:40,746
That it may be a "who" that's changing me.

916
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:46,312
But now that begs the
question: what do I do with her?

917
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:48,517
<i>I have to warn you,
he's heavily medicated.</i>

918
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:51,090
I doubt he'll be able to string
two words together right now,

919
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,814
much less have a conversation.

920
00:41:53,885 --> 00:41:56,018
Thanks.

921
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,666
Hey, Jimmy.

922
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:04,502
So this is where you ended up, huh?

923
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:08,054
I was so wrapped up in
recovery, I forgot to come visit.

924
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:10,496
You know, from when you shot me.

925
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:16,351
I have to ask you something, Jimmy,

926
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:18,720
about that day.

927
00:42:24,754 --> 00:42:27,040
What happened to you, Jimmy?

928
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:29,624
What happened with Lucifer?

929
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,926
Lucifer?

930
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:35,151
What happened when you shot at me?

931
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,105
- Is he here?! Tell me he's not here!
- No.

932
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,337
No, Jimmy, he's not here.
He's not here, Jimmy.

933
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:40,539
I know he's here.

934
00:42:40,575 --> 00:42:43,101
I can't get away. I
can't get away from him!

935
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:45,911
Jimmy, you're safe here.

936
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:49,771
You're safe.

937
00:42:49,806 --> 00:42:51,677
No, I'm not safe! None of us are!

938
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,390
- He's just a man, Jimmy.
- You don't get it, do you?

939
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:56,889
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

940
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,290
He's the Devil!

941
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,193
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

942
00:43:02,535 --> 00:43:07,535
