1
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,797
Lucifer. What's going on?

2
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:28,718
You've been avoiding me, Dr. Arn,
so I had to force a meeting.

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,303
Yeah, sorry about that.

4
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:32,931
- Work has been so crazy...
- Don't care.

5
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:37,101
I granted you a favor. Now you
owe me one. It's time to pay up.

6
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,063
I need a medical consultation.

7
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:44,233
If I was to tell you I had
a mole or two on my back...

8
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:48,065
perhaps you could reshape them,
maybe... zhuzh them up a bit?

9
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:49,735
I'd have to see them first.

10
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:51,785
Not possible, I'm afraid, but...

11
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,703
I have visual aids.

12
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,043
Wait, you have moles
that large on your back?

13
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:04,295
You need to get them checked
out, have them removed.

14
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,381
But I tried removing them in the past,

15
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:08,758
but the stubborn buggers
always seem to grow back.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,761
I just need you to
dress them up a smidge.

17
00:01:11,763 --> 00:01:12,971
Maybe you could...

18
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,932
attach some white
feathers or tattoo them.

19
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,892
Something cheery, flowers, maybe.

20
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:19,352
Tattoo your moles?

21
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:22,981
I was thinking maybe I could get
you a discount on some botox, but...

22
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:25,441
I don't need botox, doctor!

23
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:28,903
What I need is for you to fix
them, because they are disgusting!

24
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:30,613
Please don't hurt me.

25
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:32,326
Lucifer, what's going on?

26
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:33,839
God, I really need to put a lock

27
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:34,911
on that elevator.

28
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:38,540
Useless, doctor. Get out of my sight.

29
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,432
- Lucy, what were you doing to him?
- Nothing.

30
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,295
Huh?

31
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:49,426
What happened there, brother?
Hit another bridge whilst flying?

32
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:52,760
That happened one time, Lucy.

33
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:55,805
And no, I got into a fight with Remy.

34
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:58,611
Remy was here?

35
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:00,893
Oh. How is your little clone?

36
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:02,061
Angry.

37
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:04,090
She wanted to take Linda's baby,

38
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:06,941
my child, back to the
Silver City with her.

39
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:08,192
The argument escalated.

40
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,738
Of course, I was victorious and now
the child will be raised here on Earth,

41
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,073
which is actually why I'm here.

42
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:15,408
I have a favor to ask you.

43
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,898
Oh.

44
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:18,911
Apparently, there's a
tradition here on Earth

45
00:02:18,913 --> 00:02:21,180
to ask someone to be a back-up parent

46
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,375
in case something happens
to the child's real parents.

47
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,418
Oh.

48
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,336
Are you seriously asking me,

49
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:30,089
evil incarnate, to be
the child's godfather?

50
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:31,131
Ha!

51
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,617
The irony.

52
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,554
Well, Lucy, this birth is imminent.

53
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:38,139
And I still don't know
how to be a father.

54
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:39,432
How am I supposed to prepare?

55
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:42,185
Well, I would have thought
it patently obvious by now.

56
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:44,854
I'm the last person to
come to for fatherly advice.

57
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:48,566
But if you really want to know
how humans raise their children,

58
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,653
maybe you should, I
don't know, ask them.

59
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:54,155
That's actually not bad advice.

60
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:57,158
And as for being the child's
godfather, trust me, brother,

61
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,619
the biggest favor I can
do you and the child

62
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,664
is to stay as far away as possible.

63
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,223
Hey, Ella.

64
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:22,102
Oh, hey, Dan.

65
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:23,851
So what's up?

66
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:25,645
Nothing. Crime scene stuff.

67
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:26,689
Yeah.

68
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:28,815
Cool.

69
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:31,192
So, about the other...

70
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:32,318
Yeah, I wanted to...

71
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,402
- Me too.
- It was...

72
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:34,946
- Totally...
- But, you know...

73
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,656
- Working together.
- Crossing lines.

74
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:37,865
Bodies crossing.

75
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:38,868
Yeah.

76
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:41,609
Maybe we shouldn't.

77
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,663
No, we shouldn't.

78
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:44,999
- Cool.
- Cool.

79
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:51,254
I'm so glad we could talk
about this like adults.

80
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:52,755
- Yeah, okay.
- Cool.

81
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:54,551
Oh, sorry. I'm just...

82
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:57,239
Okay.

83
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:00,831
When the devil walks the earth

84
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,848
and finds his first love...

85
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:05,184
evil shall be released.

86
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:08,938
Everything alright, detective? Did
I do something wrong, per usual?

87
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,607
Perhaps I should check myself
into detention whilst I'm here.

88
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,400
Permanently.

89
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:15,363
No. Everything's fine.

90
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:18,573
Hey, guys.

91
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,741
Oh, hey, Lucifer.

92
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:24,704
Hey, Dan's ex-wife. Ex-wife.

93
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:26,541
I mean... I mean Chloe.

94
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:28,751
So what do we have?

95
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:32,604
- This is Sandra Baez...
- The victim is... Yeah.

96
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:36,506
She was 32 years old...
and a history teacher.

97
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,552
Whatever's happening here is
undoubtedly somehow my fault.

98
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:42,138
- Er...
- Maybe you... I'm sorry.

99
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,806
Nothing. We're all good.

100
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:45,558
- We're totally cool.
- All good.

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,171
In fact, the janitor, he's
the guy who found the body...

102
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:51,793
claims that Miss Baez, every
morning, jogs the track,

103
00:04:51,796 --> 00:04:53,691
showers and then she heads to class.

104
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,777
And apparently someone ambushed
her as she was getting dressed.

105
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,640
And do we have a cause of death?

106
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,820
Cause of death is a blunt
force trauma to the head.

107
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,035
It turns out that Miss
Baez was a faculty adviser.

108
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,580
- Yeah, she was.
- To YEA.

109
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:11,083
Uh, YEA is Youth Academy
of American Entrepreneurs.

110
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:12,752
The club met last night,

111
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:15,630
so probably the last
people to see her alive.

112
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:17,632
Right, thank you.

113
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:18,885
Lucifer.

114
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,137
Can I talk to you?

115
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,747
Right now.

116
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,099
Sure.

117
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,517
Okay, well...

118
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,022
I need to tell you something.

119
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,440
I'm all ears. Or horns, rather.

120
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:35,860
I went to see Father Kinley.

121
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,528
Oh. Did you now?

122
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,865
Conjuring up more ways to
send me back to hell, are we?

123
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,242
No. No.

124
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:48,539
Father Kinley had been asking to
see me, so I finally went and...

125
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:51,292
he told me about...

126
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,211
a prophecy.

127
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,923
Right.

128
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,595
What is it this time? Are frogs about
to start falling from the sky or...

129
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:05,388
perhaps winter is coming.

130
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,058
All of this celestial
stuff, it is new to me.

131
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,519
I don't know what is good and bad,

132
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:12,895
what is real and fake.

133
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:14,265
But what he said...

134
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,732
It scared me.

135
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,943
Well, come on then,
detective. What did he say?

136
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,986
He said,

137
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:24,409
"When the devil walks the earth
and finds his first love...

138
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:27,412
evil shall be released."

139
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:32,081
Well, this is wonderful news.

140
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,211
- It sounds kind of bad.
- Oh, it's bad. It's bad, but...

141
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,379
it explains why I'm changing.

142
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:39,463
Wait up...

143
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:43,175
listen, if this prophecy
were to actually come true...

144
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,179
What then? Would there
be demons running around?

145
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:48,973
Nothing of the sort.

146
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,850
But let's not get
bogged down in specifics,

147
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:53,769
because none of that will matter if
I can stop the prophecy altogether.

148
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:55,604
- How?
- Well, clearly the first part,

149
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,481
when the devil walks
the earth, has happened,

150
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,650
because hello, here is
me, walking the earth.

151
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,111
- Yeah.
- And since Eve was my first girlfriend,

152
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:03,162
then she's...

153
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:04,655
- Your first love.
- Exactly.

154
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,953
So to stop evil being released, all
I need to do is, drum roll, please...

155
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:11,384
Break up with Eve!

156
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,876
So there you have it.

157
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:20,840
I mean, usually these prophecies
turn out to be gobbledegook, but...

158
00:07:21,548 --> 00:07:23,631
this one seems legit.

159
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:24,759
So...

160
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,347
Wow.

161
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:29,513
I had a feeling...

162
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:32,892
or maybe I just knew all along.

163
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:35,019
- Knew what?
- That you love me!

164
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:40,566
Right. And how exactly
did you end up there?

165
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:42,485
The prophecy, silly.

166
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:46,091
I mean, if you believe
it to be true then,

167
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,323
"When the devil walks the earth

168
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:53,662
and meets his first love," means
you consider me to be your...

169
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:55,220
first love.

170
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:56,542
Ergo!

171
00:07:57,668 --> 00:07:59,877
- You love me.
- Mm...

172
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:04,256
Oh, my God! I can't
believe you said it first.

173
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:06,258
I've been dying to say it for so long.

174
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,385
Have you?

175
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,429
Interesting you should focus
on that part of the prophecy,

176
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:13,559
when evil being
released really is the...

177
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:15,976
the relevant part.

178
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:18,646
And much as I hate to say this,

179
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:20,712
I think it means that we need to...

180
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:21,984
you know...

181
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:24,642
break up.

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,406
No.

183
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,316
- No?
- Mm-mm.

184
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,536
Lucifer, I know what you're doing.

185
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:34,829
- Do you?
- Yes.

186
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:37,998
You're scared. Because
you've been hurt before.

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,710
You don't have to worry, okay?

188
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:44,674
I promise you that I
will never, ever, ever...

189
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,058
give up on you.

190
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:48,457
You know why?

191
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,441
Surprise me.

192
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:53,641
Because I love you too.

193
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,293
Ah...

194
00:08:58,296 --> 00:08:59,478
Boop!

195
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,316
Shit.

196

197
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,332
Thanks for speaking with us, Miss Shaw.

198
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:22,334
Please, call me Lexy.

199
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,420
Anything to help find
the person who did this.

200
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:26,213
We're speaking to
everybody in the YEA club,

201
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:29,175
because you all were the last
to see Miss Baez last night.

202
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:32,011
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary with her?

203
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:35,055
No. She was her normal, cheery self.

204
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:38,100
Miss Baez was awesome.
She did so much for me.

205
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:40,182
She was also the SAT prep administrator,

206
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:42,942
so helped me get into my first choice.

207
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:45,151
It was Harvard.

208
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:48,152
- Oh.
- She's also just so good at giving advice

209
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,361
on anything.

210
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:52,114
School, parents, relationships.

211
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:53,949
Relationships?

212
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:57,703
What advice would Miss Baez give
to, say, a student in a relationship

213
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:00,789
who, I don't know, needed
to break up with someone?

214
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,627
Oh, well, I wouldn't know. My
boyfriend and I are super-solid.

215
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:06,086
We'll probably get married.

216
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:08,502
After we both finish
college. At Harvard.

217
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:10,080
Right.

218
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,384
Do you know of anyone who
may want to hurt Miss Baez?

219
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:15,638
Not really. Well, unless...

220
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,515
Have you spoken to Caleb Mayfield?

221
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,099
No. Why?

222
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:22,647
Miss Baez was particularly talented
at giving advice to the more...

223
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:25,898
troubled students.

224
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,024
Ah.

225
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:30,611
Nah, I didn't really
know Miss Baez that well.

226
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:33,364
To be honest, I was thinking
about quitting YEA altogether.

227
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,324
You were going to break
up with the entire club.

228
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:38,619
How does one specifically
say nay to YEA?

229
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:40,996
Could we just stay focused, Lucifer?

230
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:44,124
Lucifer? As in the club
owner who grants favors?

231
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:45,793
You've heard of the favors?

232
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:48,796
Some people I hang around with,
they may have mentioned it.

233
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:51,799
Well, granting favors is much
lower on my resume these days

234
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:54,760
than releasing death and
destruction upon the world.

235
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:57,513
So you didn't spend
much time with Miss Baez?

236
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:59,241
Not really.

237
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:02,788
Did you guys talk to Nate
Benedict? He was fighting with her.

238
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,353
Mm.

239
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,647
We had, you know, words.

240
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,232
What were you fighting about?

241
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,859
I was pissed because she
was sleeping with my dad.

242
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,153
Miss Baez was having an
affair with your father?

243
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:16,240
My parents are separated, and they
totally could have fixed things,

244
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,577
but Miss Baez was standing in the
way, so hells yeah, I was angry.

245
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,329
- I see.
- But not enough so I'd kill her.

246
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:24,373
And where were you yesterday morning?

247
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,958
At my girlfriend Lexy's place.

248
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,043
My dad said he had things
he needed to take care of,

249
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:29,211
He needed me out all night.

250
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:32,339
We'll have to speak with your
dad to confirm your story.

251
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:33,676
And his. Thank you.

252
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:36,010
Oh...

253
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:37,720
Your parents' marriage failed.

254
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:41,473
What exactly was the final nail in
the coffin of their relationship?

255
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,425
Weirdly enough, things got really bad

256
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:45,060
after they went to couple's therapy.

257
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:46,185
Therapy.

258
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:48,691
Of course.

259
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,785
Excuse me. Do you have any children?

260
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:03,621
Why? Did Ramona send you?

261
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,826
Hey, man, I'm all paid
up on my child support.

262
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,760
Excuse me. Do you have a good
relationship with your father?

263
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:20,806
I love all my daddies.

264
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:24,894
Right.

265
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:30,229
Excuse me!

266
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,692
Do you have a good
relationship with your father?

267
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:36,897
I'm dancing half naked
in a nightclub for money.

268
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,366
What do you think?

269
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,665
Hey...

270
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,999
do you know where I could
find Lucifer Morningstar?

271
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,167
He's not here right now.

272
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,169
- Damn.
- What do you need from Lucifer?

273
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,866
Just...

274
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:56,382
- a favor. Thanks.
- Whoa, hold up.

275
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:59,426
Maybe I can help. I'm
Amenadiel, Lucifer's brother.

276
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,929
- For real?
- As God is my witness.

277
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,138
I'm Caleb.

278
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,850
So what's the problem, Caleb?

279
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,435
This.

280
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:11,063
Xanax and Adderall.

281
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:14,066
- Where did you get all these drugs from?
- A dealer.

282
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:15,734
His name's Tahir.

283
00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:17,695
He asked me to sell it
at school. I did once.

284
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,780
I'm just trying not to do it no more.

285
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,491
Problem is, he said if I
don't, he'll mess me up bad.

286
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:24,910
I was hoping maybe Lucifer
could buy them off me.

287
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:27,579
Just take them off my hands. Could you?

288
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,418
Listen, even if I did, that
wouldn't solve your problem.

289
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,962
It sounds like this Tahir would
just, you know, make you sell more.

290
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,683
What am I supposed to do?

291
00:13:36,686 --> 00:13:38,342
I just want out.

292
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:44,054
Hey, Ella, you wanted to see me?

293
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,515
Yes, Sandra Baez's autopsy
report just came in.

294
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:49,059
Great. I'll go and get Dan
and we can go over it together.

295
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:53,021
No! Don't. I'll just tell you what
it says and then you can tell Dan.

296
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,399
Because, you know, you
probably see him all the time,

297
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,401
like when you're handing off Trixie,

298
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:01,697
the child you made together
when you were married together.

299
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:03,407
Okay.

300
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,368
So... what does it say?

301
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,536
Contusions.

302
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:10,247
Two of them on the victim's skull.

303
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:14,585
Unusually shaped, so it appears that
the murder weapon is a golf club.

304
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,086
A driver, to be exact.

305
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,381
Got it. I'll tell Dan that we need a
search warrant for the golf lockers.

306
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:20,482
Good.

307
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,750
Forensics.

308
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:27,937
Yeah, I worked the Tiernan case.

309
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:33,689
I'm sorry, where did you
say you were calling from?

310
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,859
So how do you like being a prison guard?

311
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:48,662
Boring. Unless you get to mix it
up, you know, fight with an inmate.

312
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:50,706
How's bounty hunting?

313
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,499
Look, I'm going to get to the point.

314
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,584
Usually I go straight for the sex,

315
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:58,378
but my friend thinks I'm
too invested in her baby...

316
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,381
thinks I need to find a
connection of my own, so...

317
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:03,500
I'm looking for someone
I can do that with.

318
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:06,388
Whatever. I'm in.

319
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:11,393
You're too clingy. This
is never going to work.

320
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:22,319
I recently learned, doctor,

321
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:26,490
that counseling is a good way to
help relationships grow, evolve

322
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,994
and then reach their final destination.

323
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,997
Yes, it can be.

324
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,040
In the right circumstance.

325
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:39,461
Linda, I'm so happy to finally meet you.

326
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:41,841
And being here in this room...

327
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,677
Woo! It's kind of like
being inside Lucifer's mind.

328
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:49,346
Scary thought.

329
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,514
Ha-ha!

330
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:55,185
Yes, well, I'm very happy
to meet you too, Eve.

331
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:59,064
Wow. You're the first woman ever.

332
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,941
It's like meeting a dinosaur.

333
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:03,277
Not that you look old.

334
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,113
I mean, it's like you're my great-great,

335
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,739
great-great...

336
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:08,782
whatever.

337
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,284
Ah! Never mind.

338
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:12,580
What can I do for you guys?

339
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:16,540
I think, if you looked up "perfect
relationship" in the dictionary,

340
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,251
you might just see a
photo of myself and Eve.

341
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:20,460
Mm!

342
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:24,673
But complacency is the enemy of
excellence, so I thought it wise

343
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:28,387
to get your expert perspective
on our wonderful kinship.

344
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,346
I'm guessing this
isn't going to end well.

345
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:37,603
Please, tell me about this
wonderful relationship of yours.

346
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:41,398
Well, I'd say that we are impulsive.

347
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,271
I mean, we often text whilst driving.

348
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:45,193
We moved in together after one day.

349
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:48,822
Also we consume an unfathomable
amount of drugs and alcohol

350
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:52,701
and regularly invite
strangers into our bedroom.

351
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:53,744
It's true.

352
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,830
Did I mention that Eve has just come
out of a long-term relationship?

353
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,749
So, what say you, doctor?

354
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,667
Hm. Yes, well...

355
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:03,128
while you claim to be happy,

356
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,923
I'm sensing a hidden trepidation

357
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,717
by the words that you're using
to describe your relationship.

358
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:10,844
In fact, I'm concerned

359
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,442
that you're returning to
a familiar pattern of...

360
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:14,558
Denial.

361
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:18,727
That's exactly what I was going to say.

362
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:20,020
Don't you just hate it

363
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:22,376
when he takes the exact wrong message

364
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,358
from every single conversation?

365
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,692
Oh, my God!

366
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:29,321
Every single time!

367
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:32,741
- Right. Why don't we get back on track?
- How have we not met?

368
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:35,285
- I don't know!
- Right, there's a prophecy.

369
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,020
Now he's just deflecting.

370
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,039
I couldn't have said it better myself.

371
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,856
You know, Lucifer has a tendency to

372
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:44,585
project his issues onto external sources

373
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:46,046
when what he really needs to do

374
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:48,090
- is face his issues head on.
- Head on.

375
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,513
Finally!

376
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:01,561
You sure you know what you're doing?

377
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:04,189
Caleb, I'm the Silver
City's greatest warrior.

378
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:06,443
There's no need to worry. Ha!

379
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:09,110
Tell me something.

380
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:11,824
How did you get involved in
this business in the first place?

381
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,950
I met Tahir and his boys at a club.

382
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:17,244
He seemed cool, so I
start hanging with them.

383
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:21,665
Then one day, Tahir offered me
a way to make some extra cash.

384
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,291
Why didn't you just say no?

385
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:25,460
Tahir's not really the
kind of guy you say no to.

386
00:18:25,462 --> 00:18:28,463
I'm pretty sure I can
reason with this Tahir...

387
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:30,134
convince him to let you off the hook.

388
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,761
And then maybe, after...

389
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,931
we can go and get some
ice cream together.

390
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,813
Ha! My man, Caleb.

391
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:45,105
What's good, man?

392
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,525
Oh, you need bodyguards now?

393
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,573
What's wrong? The white kids at school

394
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:52,236
loving them beans a little bit too much?

395
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:55,449
Actually, Caleb won't be
selling them beans anymore.

396
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,089
You see, he no longer wishes to be a

397
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:59,902
part of your illegal drug operation.

398
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:12,426
- Oh...
- Excuse me.

399
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:17,804
Caleb is out.

400
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,581
His obligation is done.

401
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:22,308
This dude right here means business.

402
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:23,976
But it don't work like that.

403
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:26,855
You see, I've got expenses,
and he needs to pay me out,

404
00:19:26,857 --> 00:19:28,231
one way or another.

405
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,443
Alright, fine. I'll be the one to
come back and pay for those drugs.

406
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:32,611
Uh-oh, hold on, man.

407
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:34,196
The honor code's broken right now.

408
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:36,406
You'll have to leave me
some kind of collateral.

409
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,203
- What about the kid?
- That's never going to happen, Tahir.

410
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:42,456
What about that bling around your neck?

411
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:47,751
This bling is a gift from my
father, Tahir. It's priceless.

412
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,211
That's good.

413
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:52,466
That means you'll be highly
motivated to come back with my money.

414
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:05,938
I will be coming back for that.

415
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,775
Know this, Caleb.

416
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,571
If anything blow back on
me, I blow back on y'all.

417
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:16,490
You feel me?

418
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:22,536
I can't believe she's gone.

419
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,913
Miss Baez was a great mentor to Nate.

420
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:28,542
Nate said that you asked him to
be out of the house last night.

421
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:31,336
- What was it you needed to take care of?
- Work stuff.

422
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:32,420
Work stuff?

423
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:34,339
Like murdering a beloved teacher?

424
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:36,508
You think I killed her? That's insane.

425
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,507
Is it?

426
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,718
You were sleeping with her.

427
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,972
Yes, we were having an affair, but
that's over. Broke off last week.

428
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,724
You didn't have to kill her
to break up with her, did you?

429
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:45,809
Of course not!

430
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,311
- Oh.
- It was mutual. In fact, I already...

431
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,938
started seeing somebody else.

432
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,732
So you were having an
affair on your affair?

433
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:56,236
Not exactly. I started seeing my
ex, Emma. We had gone to counseling.

434
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:59,114
It was rough at first, but ultimately
it helped bring us back together.

435
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:00,157
Now you tell me!

436
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,991
Last night I was with Emma.

437
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,661
We didn't want to tell Nate, we
didn't want to mess with his head.

438
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,664
He had taken our break-up really
hard, but he's doing so great lately.

439
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,249
He's seeing Lexy, great girl.

440
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,626
Crushed his SATs, he got into Harvard.

441
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:14,045
We didn't want to rattle him until...

442
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:15,589
we knew it was permanent.

443
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:18,133
I'll need your ex-wife's information.

444
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:22,097
Er... why did you and your wife
break up in the first place?

445
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,267
I suppose I was the
cliché bad husband.

446
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:30,395
Infidelity, selfishness, neglect.

447
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:33,442
In hindsight, I gave Emma no
option but to break up with me.

448
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:38,280
Cliché bad husband, I see.

449
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,374
You're going to get it!

450
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,459
Er, babe?

451
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:55,170
I thought we had plans.

452
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:57,088
Nah, sorry...

453
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,508
right, Lynn, you're up next!

454
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:35,754
Move! Move! Ah! Aha!

455
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,054
Yes! Yes!

456
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:48,308
Suck it! Suck it!

457
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:13,039
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

458
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:22,048
In your face! Ah!

459
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,216
Yes!

460
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:25,176
Detective. How can I help?

461
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:28,263
We know who the killer is.
Meet me at the precinct.

462
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:29,847
Right.

463
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,435
Erm... Eve!

464
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:33,518
I have to go.

465
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,354
Hey, are you sure you
can't stay a little longer?

466
00:23:36,356 --> 00:23:37,605
We have queso!

467
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:39,234
It's work.

468
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:46,072
Yo, did you see the look on their face

469
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:48,783
when you busted up homeboy's hand?

470
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,952
I told you I've got skills, young buck.

471
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:53,206
Not bad. I'll never doubt you again.

472
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,874
See, I knew that you were smart.

473
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:57,625
Which does make me wonder, Caleb,

474
00:23:57,627 --> 00:24:00,045
why would you even want to
be friends with those guys?

475
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,756
I mean, you must have lots
of friends back at school.

476
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:05,842
Yeah, but I don't really fit
in with the rich, white crowd.

477
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,970
Tahir and his boys, they look like me.

478
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:10,430
They let me be me.

479
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:13,308
I mean, if I knew what they
was into in the beginning,

480
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,685
maybe I would have found
a new crew to hang with.

481
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,690
It's just kind of hard
finding your own kind.

482
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,825
Your own people, you know?

483
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,279
I've got a question for you.

484
00:24:25,906 --> 00:24:27,405
Why are you even helping me?

485
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:28,597
I, erm...

486
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:32,329
I have a son on the way.

487
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,253
Yeah.

488
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,914
And I've been worried if I'm
going to be a good father.

489
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:43,417
So, what? I'm like a test run for you?

490
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:50,656
I was just playing, man.

491
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:52,136
I'm cool with it.

492
00:24:58,438 --> 00:24:59,815
Are you Caleb Mayfield?

493
00:25:01,024 --> 00:25:04,194
- I said are you Caleb Mayfield?
- Yes, this is Caleb, officer.

494
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,695
- What's the problem?
- We've got a warrant out for his arrest.

495
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:09,616
- He's wanted for murder.
- Murder?

496
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:13,743
No. No, that can't be right.

497
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,703
Down on the ground, hands on your head.

498
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:17,455
Listen, punk, I said
down on the ground,

499
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:18,748
hands on your head.

500
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,083
You're hurting him!

501
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,213
- Sir, stop right there, put your hands up.
- Put my hands, wh...

502
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:25,843
Why are you pointing your gun at me?

503
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:27,590
I've done absolutely nothing wrong.

504
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,509
Put your hands on your head now!

505
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:35,557
Look, you guys are making
a big mistake here, alright?

506
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,977
Now I have friends in the
LAPD. Just let me call them.

507
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:41,354
- No, no, please just do what they say!
- You're hurting him!

508
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:43,445
- Put your hands on your head!
- Get off of him!

509
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:46,192
I'll tell you one last time,
asshole. Put your hands up!

510
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:48,903
- I'm not putting my hands above my head!
- Don't make me shoot you.

511
00:25:48,905 --> 00:25:50,321
I don't want to shoot you!

512
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:53,368
Stand down! He's my
friend! He's a friend.

513
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:01,585
Are you okay?

514
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:14,428
A golf club...

515
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:18,560
with Caleb's prints and the victim's
blood was found in his locker.

516
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:21,478
Caleb was known to sell drugs,

517
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,606
so the working theory is
that Miss Baez found out,

518
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:26,566
threatened to turn him
in, so he killed her.

519
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:27,859
No, Dan.

520
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:29,486
Caleb is not a killer.

521
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,821
Okay. But the kid looks guilty.

522
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:34,356
What exactly does "looks
guilty" even mean, Dan?

523
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,433
Are you talking about
the color of his skin?

524
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,287
He's guilty given all the...

525
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:41,833
evidence against him,
man. Come on, how dare you?

526
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:50,006
Are you okay?

527
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,800
I know it's not fun to have guns...

528
00:26:52,802 --> 00:26:53,968
pointed at you.

529
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,828
Why wouldn't those
officers listen to me?

530
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:58,620
I tried to talk to them,
reason with them, but they...

531
00:26:58,623 --> 00:27:01,058
They wouldn't listen.

532
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:03,144
It's like they'd already
made up their minds.

533
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:05,401
Those two cowboy hotheads
are way out of line

534
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:07,649
I'm filing an excessive
force complaint against them

535
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,150
as soon as all this is over.

536
00:27:09,152 --> 00:27:11,110
And what changes will come...

537
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:13,949
as a result of your complaint?

538
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:17,202
Probably nothing.

539
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:20,288
Hey, Dan...

540
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:22,958
can I talk to you for a second?

541
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:32,465
Okay.

542
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:36,302
I'm not really sure
how to say this, but...

543
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:37,637
Hold on a second.

544
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:41,558
I thought that we were
on the same page about us.

545
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,351
This is about the Tiernan case.

546
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:45,770
Right. I'm sorry. What about it?

547
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:48,314
To close the case, due
diligence interviews were done

548
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:49,524
by the detective pool.

549
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:51,945
Someone told them that
it might've been a cop...

550
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:54,445
who came to Jacob Tiernan

551
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:57,865
and told him that it was Lucifer
himself who broke his son's back.

552
00:27:57,867 --> 00:27:59,367
It's an outrageous claim.

553
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:01,869
I know! But what if it's true?

554
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:04,122
Someone might have it out for Lucifer.

555
00:28:04,124 --> 00:28:05,456
I guess it's possible.

556
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,917
I could narrow down
which cop it could be

557
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,336
by tracking the department cars,
but I don't know what to do,

558
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:11,840
whether to tell Chloe or not...

559
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,466
Whoa, Dan!

560
00:28:15,468 --> 00:28:16,884
What are you doing?

561
00:28:16,886 --> 00:28:18,636
I'm flattered, but I just...

562
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:21,556
You're right, we need to
be on the same page here,

563
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:25,310
which is that this is no bueno.

564
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:27,063
I got caught up in the moment.

565
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:29,482
It won't happen again.

566
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,816
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

567
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:34,861
And the Tiernan thing, sounds like
it's way out of left field to me.

568
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:38,114
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Er...

569
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,575
Okay. Anyway, er...

570
00:28:40,577 --> 00:28:41,748
Later.

571
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:42,829
Later.

572
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:10,315
So listen, I talked to your parents.

573
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,815
They're flying back from vacation.

574
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,859
We're going to get you a good lawyer,

575
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:17,197
clear your name and
you'll be out of here soon.

576
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:21,288
Let me ask you something.
What makes you sure

577
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,493
- I didn't kill that teacher?
- I know you wouldn't.

578
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,079
You figured all that out by
knowing me for one whole day?

579
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:29,123
Yes. I know you wouldn't
murder anyone, Caleb.

580
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,085
But that doesn't matter. So
who cares if you believe me?

581
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:33,234
The cops don't.

582
00:29:33,237 --> 00:29:34,587
But you're innocent.

583
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:37,799
The truth will come out and they'll
have no choice but to set you free...

584
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:41,260
What kind of bullshit, fantasy
world do you be living in, man?

585
00:29:41,262 --> 00:29:42,929
I mean, look what happened to you.

586
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:45,765
You didn't even do anything
and you almost got shot.

587
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:48,685
The only truth that matters is theirs.

588
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:52,188
And to them, I am a black
kid who is selling drugs,

589
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,943
whose fingerprints were
found on the murder weapon.

590
00:29:56,236 --> 00:29:58,528
My life is over.

591
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,907
Just go. Stop wasting your time on me.

592
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:04,242
I'm not leaving you, Caleb.

593
00:30:04,244 --> 00:30:07,787
Now, there are good people out there
who can find out the real truth,

594
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:09,288
but they're gonna need your help.

595
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,877
And I'm not asking you to have
faith in them. Have faith in me.

596
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,721
Okay?

597
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,854
This is an interesting pair-up, huh?

598
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:34,023
Loved your profile.

599
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:38,484
And all those stories you made
up about murderous exploits...

600
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:40,319
Wow!

601
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:43,074
Ah. Consider me turned on.

602
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,660
But...

603
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:49,247
I don't see this working out.

604
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:53,001
I mean, we're both clearly Alphas.

605
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:57,170
We'd just wind up butting
heads and locking horns.

606
00:30:57,172 --> 00:30:58,965
I just don't see a future together.

607
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,721
But have a lovely evening
and good luck, milady.

608
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,473
Mm-hm.

609
00:31:08,808 --> 00:31:09,966
Argh!

610
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,088
Oh, hey, Maze.

611
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:17,148
Have you seen Lucifer?

612
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,372
No.

613
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,443
Are you okay?

614
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,236
That was my 21st bad date.

615
00:31:22,238 --> 00:31:24,911
And my 22nd is about
to arrive any minute.

616
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:26,201
Damn.

617
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,661
Talk about stamina.

618
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:31,873
I know this must sound crazy...

619
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,959
but I'm starting to think that maybe...

620
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,960
I'm the problem.

621
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,545
That is crazy.

622
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:41,255
You're awesome.

623
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:43,216
What are you doing on these dates?

624
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:44,342
Normal stuff.

625
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:45,676
Okay.

626
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:47,138
Well, why don't we...

627
00:31:48,264 --> 00:31:51,059
figure this out. Let's practice on me.

628
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:54,800
We can pretend to be on a date and then

629
00:31:54,803 --> 00:31:57,522
try to figure out what's going wrong.

630
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:58,528
Okay.

631
00:31:58,591 --> 00:31:59,816
Okay.

632
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,025
I'll start.

633
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:04,695
Hi. I'm Eve.

634
00:32:04,697 --> 00:32:06,989
Hey. I'm Maze.

635
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,159
Nice to meet you.

636
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,662
Want to have sex?

637
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,997
Good.

638
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,042
There's nothing wrong with
having sex on a first date.

639
00:32:18,044 --> 00:32:23,630
But, you know, maybe just wait a
few sentences before you go there.

640
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:27,343
Okay, tell me about yourself.

641
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,512
Well, I like sex.

642
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,919
Good.

643
00:32:30,922 --> 00:32:32,267
And?

644
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:39,607
It's just hard to open up about my life.

645
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:44,402
- I am a demon after all.
- What's wrong with that?

646
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:48,950
Anybody worth dating should
understand everything that makes you...

647
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,349
you.

648
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:54,914
Anyway, don't you have
another hot date coming?

649
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,542
Looks like he's a no-show.

650
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,753
Why don't we keep going?

651
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:03,339
You know, this is really helping.

652
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,383
Yeah.

653
00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:10,261
So how are things going with Eve?

654
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:12,471
Not good.

655
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:15,641
I tried being a super bad
boyfriend so she'd break up with me,

656
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:17,435
but it failed spectacularly.

657
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:20,440
Of course it failed, Lucifer,
because that's not who you are.

658
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:25,052
How do you know who I am?

659
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:28,778
Caleb Mayfield is innocent, Chloe,

660
00:33:28,781 --> 00:33:30,323
you really need to look into it.

661
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:31,699
Did he say something to you?

662
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:33,284
Yes! That he's being set up.

663
00:33:33,286 --> 00:33:36,662
Did he say by who? Because I've been
looking at it as well and I agree,

664
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:38,664
something doesn't add
up. It's just too easy.

665
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,106
Whoever framed him must have known

666
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:41,792
that he would make a really good target.

667
00:33:41,794 --> 00:33:43,461
- You mean they knew he sold drugs?
- Yes.

668
00:33:43,463 --> 00:33:47,006
I had Caleb write down a list
of all the kids that he sold to.

669
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,051
Here's a list of everyone who
had access to the golf closet.

670
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:52,345
If one of these kids
is on Caleb's list too,

671
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:56,057
then that person would have means
and opportunity to set him up.

672
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:57,433
So let's see.

673
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,852
No. None of the names match.

674
00:33:59,854 --> 00:34:01,773
Aren't those two dating?

675
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,526
Lexy Shaw and Nate Benedict.
And they're each other's alibi.

676
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:13,868
I'm sorry I didn't come forward sooner.

677
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:15,855
I was afraid.

678
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:20,539
Maybe I didn't want to accept it.

679
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,792
That he could do something like this.

680
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:27,713
So Nate killed Miss Baez?

681
00:34:29,008 --> 00:34:30,218
I love him.

682
00:34:32,261 --> 00:34:34,178
But he can get so angry sometimes,

683
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,846
- it's scary.
- Mm-hm.

684
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:38,099
And Nate was devastated
when his parents split up.

685
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:39,936
I think he blamed it on Miss Baez.

686
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,728
I just never thought he'd go this far.

687
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:47,777
Lexy, let's take a break, alright?
And I'll go grab you some tissues.

688
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,208
She's lying.

689
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,587
Then tell them the truth, Nate. Now.

690
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:09,924
It's all because of stupid Harvard.

691
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:14,844
Lexy had to get in. She
insisted that I go too.

692
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,388
And she got us a ton of Adderall
so we could study harder.

693
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,515
My grades went up and then the SAT came

694
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,101
and Miss Baez was the
test administrator.

695
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:23,394
You stole the test.

696
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:25,271
We knew she had a copy in her office.

697
00:35:25,273 --> 00:35:27,940
I didn't want to do it and she made me.

698
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,525
And then Miss Baez found out.

699
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,652
That's why you were fighting
after the YEA meeting?

700
00:35:31,654 --> 00:35:33,487
She told me that if I didn't come clean,

701
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,364
she was calling my
dad and then the cops.

702
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,701
And when I told Lexy, she... freaked.

703
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,412
Said, "I have worked too
hard to get into Harvard

704
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:43,080
and I'm not letting Miss Baez ruin it,"

705
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:44,832
and she made me steal Caleb's club...

706
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:46,474
You? You killed her?

707
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,462
No! I couldn't do it,
but Lexy... Lexy did.

708
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:51,215
And I'm just as bad because...

709
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:54,302
Because I covered it all up and I lied

710
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:55,843
about Caleb. He didn't do anything.

711
00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:57,511
Why should we believe you, Nate?

712
00:35:57,513 --> 00:35:59,847
- I'm telling the truth and I can prove it.
- How?

713
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:01,100
Lexy's bloody clothes...

714
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,895
I was supposed to get
rid of them and I didn't.

715
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,190
I didn't even care about Harvard.

716
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:12,318
Lexy just wanted me
to be someone I'm not

717
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,405
and I should have stood up to
her before anybody got hurt.

718
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,766
I'm so sorry.

719
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,959
So you're free to go.

720
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:30,669
You got your necklace back.

721
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:33,257
Yeah, I paid off Tahir, so...

722
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,219
you don't have to
worry about him anymore.

723
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,595
Looks like I owe you a favor now.

724
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:40,763
How can I get you back?

725
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,890
Know something? I've
been thinking about that

726
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:46,393
and I will accept nothing less

727
00:36:46,395 --> 00:36:49,982
than a game of one-on-one tomorrow.

728
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,102
As long as we can get
ice cream afterwards.

729
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,029
By the way...

730
00:36:57,038 --> 00:36:59,249
- you got nothing to worry about.
- About what?

731
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,575
Being a dad.

732
00:37:01,577 --> 00:37:02,852
You gonna to crush it.

733
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,081
I'll see you tomorrow.

734
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:13,671
And he got all upset with me because
I laughed at the end of the movie.

735
00:37:13,673 --> 00:37:15,297
I thought it was a comedy.

736
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,094
Have you seen it?

737
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,761
Marley And Me?

738
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:22,471
No.

739
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,266
But maybe we can watch it together.

740
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:28,062
Yeah, that would be nice.

741
00:37:28,984 --> 00:37:30,064
Ah.

742
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:34,819
Anyway, enough about
my bad dating stories.

743
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:37,383
Don't you have any?

744
00:37:37,386 --> 00:37:39,196
Bad dating stories?

745
00:37:39,198 --> 00:37:43,868
Er, no. I was married for,
like, thousands of years.

746
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,496
And then, on my second
try, I found the one.

747
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,624
Yeah, but how did you know
that Lucifer was the one?

748
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:56,088
With Adam, I guess I felt like
I was always trying to be...

749
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,465
someone that I wasn't.

750
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:00,511
And then, with Lucifer...

751
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,892
I feel like I can just
be myself, you know?

752
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:07,852
At least I did.

753
00:38:08,728 --> 00:38:10,271
Lately, I feel like he's...

754
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,647
kind of pulling away from me.

755
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:17,359
That's just Lucifer. He can be a
self-sabotaging jackass sometimes.

756
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,447
But he will come around.

757
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,658
He'd be a fool not to.
You're way too awesome.

758
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,621
Want another drink?

759
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:30,791
- You need another drink?
- Yeah, I do.

760
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,128
Yeah.

761
00:38:37,632 --> 00:38:39,340
Yo, Mazy-Maze.

762
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:41,736
What's going on?

763
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:44,337
We're having a drink, bro.

764
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,236
Yeah, 'cause it kind of looks to me...

765
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:49,560
like you're making the
moves on Lucifer's girl.

766
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:56,522
Well, it kind of looks
to me like you're wasted.

767
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:57,942
Don't sweat it.

768
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:00,819
I'm not going to say anything,
because you and me, we're the same.

769
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:03,072
You should've seen how
I played Ella today.

770
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,367
And assholes like us...

771
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:07,409
we've got to stick together.

772
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,995
I am not interested in Eve, Dan.

773
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:12,373
We're just talking.
You know, hanging out.

774
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,083
That's great. That's cool.

775
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,207
Because that means
that you won't care...

776
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,920
if I take a shot.

777
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:21,756
Back off.

778
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,428
Whoa, so I struck a nerve after all.

779
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:26,220
I'm going to do you a solid, okay?

780
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:29,640
I'm going to go tell Eve
exactly how you feel about her.

781
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,020
Come on, Maze.

782
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:36,689
Is that all you've got?

783
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:38,717
Come on, give it to me!

784
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,441
Come on.

785
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,779
You want me to hurt you?

786
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:45,199
You're trying to punish yourself.

787
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,246
Get him out of here.

788
00:40:03,013 --> 00:40:04,787
Eve?

789
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,102
We...

790
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:17,482
we need to talk.

791
00:40:17,485 --> 00:40:18,723
I've been thinking...

792
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:21,349
Actually, I have something
I want to say first.

793
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:23,444
Go on.

794
00:40:23,446 --> 00:40:25,904
Tonight, a friend
helped me realize that...

795
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:29,076
I'm great.

796
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:32,705
No. You know what?

797
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,539
I'm awesome.

798
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,751
And...

799
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,126
I deserve to be treated well.

800
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,392
You're right.

801
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:47,300
And you are...

802
00:40:47,303 --> 00:40:49,764
so much more than awesome, Eve.

803
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:53,432
You have a light inside of
you that brightens the world

804
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:55,351
and a smile so infectious

805
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,938
that it captures the heart of
anyone lucky enough to see it.

806
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,898
And...

807
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:04,485
I'm sorry for the way that
I've treated you lately.

808
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:05,696
You don't deserve that.

809
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:10,076
- That's all I wanted to hear...
- Which is why...

810
00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:13,913
I should have just
said this straight away.

811
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,461
I want to break up with you.

812
00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:24,443
I don't...

813
00:41:25,674 --> 00:41:27,674
understand.

814
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:30,386
I've been trying so hard to...

815
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:31,549
please you.

816
00:41:31,552 --> 00:41:33,764
I've made friends with all your friends.

817
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:35,557
You see that's just it.

818
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,812
You shouldn't have to change for anyone.

819
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:40,187
And neither should I.

820
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:43,941
Eve, I have been trying so
hard to make you happy too,

821
00:41:43,943 --> 00:41:46,134
trying to be someone I'm not.

822
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,571
Or at least...

823
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,392
someone I don't want to be anymore.

824
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:57,329
And you deserve to be with
someone that wants what you want.

825
00:41:57,331 --> 00:41:58,831
I want to be with you.

826
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,710
And I don't like who I am with you!

827
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,383
I don't.

828
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:10,970
Sorry.

829
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,849
I have to take this. It's work.

830
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,437
Detective, how can I help you?

831
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,526
No, I don't know where
Amenadiel is. Why?

832
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,492
Amenadiel...

833
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:19,121
I promise you, we will
find whoever did this.

834
00:43:37,264 --> 00:43:39,539
I know who did this.

835
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:41,180
I'll drive.

836
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:06,281
What's the damage, big man?

837
00:44:09,755 --> 00:44:12,589
- Caleb.
- I warned that boy not to do that, man.

838
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:50,713
They've lost themselves.

839
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:52,715
Earth is...

840
00:44:56,635 --> 00:44:58,596
no place to raise my son.

841
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:42,229
How's Amenadiel doing?

842
00:45:42,232 --> 00:45:44,514
You know...

843
00:45:44,516 --> 00:45:45,885
tormented.

844
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:48,955
And how are you doing?

845
00:45:57,905 --> 00:45:59,323
I broke up with Eve.

846
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:06,555
Well, you know, I'm sure,

847
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,414
if it's what you wanted,
then it's all for the best.

848
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:10,626
It is what I wanted.

849
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:14,955
She was in love with
the person I used to be.

850
00:46:16,256 --> 00:46:17,589
I understand.

851
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:18,924
You've changed.

852
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:20,886
You've become a better man, Lucifer.

853
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,474
You see, that's just it, detective.

854
00:46:26,975 --> 00:46:29,395
Eve sees me in a different way.

855
00:46:30,104 --> 00:46:31,602
Mm.

856
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:32,908
But so do you.

857
00:46:37,486 --> 00:46:38,862
That's what makes you so...

858
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:42,241
So special.

859
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,868
The fact you see me that way.

860
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:48,536
But I don't like...

861
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,515
how that makes me feel either.

862
00:48:18,378 --> 00:48:19,823
This is all his fault.

863
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,503
What is?

864
00:48:23,513 --> 00:48:25,601
Every bad thing that's ever happened.

865
00:48:27,053 --> 00:48:28,260
With Eve,

866
00:48:28,263 --> 00:48:29,620
with the detective.

867
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:35,687
Dear old Dad's back up to his
old tricks, manipulating me.

868
00:48:36,605 --> 00:48:38,190
Using these two women to...

869
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:40,273
tear me apart.

870
00:48:40,275 --> 00:48:42,150
Do you really believe that?

871
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:45,904
With every fiber of my being,
but I also know it's a lie.

872
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:48,700
A grand deception I've
been telling myself for...

873
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,160
since before I can remember.

874
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:55,664
Why do you think you've been
lying to yourself all this time?

875
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,179
Because the truth is
so much harder to face.

876
00:48:58,182 --> 00:48:59,379
What is the truth?

877
00:49:01,129 --> 00:49:02,172
My devil face.

878
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,798
My...

879
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,259
devil wings, everything
that's happening to me,

880
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:08,762
it's my own bloody fault.

881
00:49:09,763 --> 00:49:12,722
I brought this upon myself.
How's about that for starters?

882
00:49:12,724 --> 00:49:15,141
Don't you see? This is progress.

883
00:49:15,143 --> 00:49:16,893
Genuine progress.

884
00:49:16,895 --> 00:49:18,979
Unraveling these patterns of denial

885
00:49:18,981 --> 00:49:23,441
is the first step toward
resolving these issues.

886
00:49:23,443 --> 00:49:25,986
No, doctor, this isn't progress.

887
00:49:25,988 --> 00:49:30,868
Because if I'm doing this to
myself, then the real truth is...

888
00:49:32,452 --> 00:49:34,248
Is what?

889
00:49:34,373 --> 00:49:35,954
Is what?

890
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:37,831
Come on, Lucifer.

891
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:41,420
This will weigh on you
unless you face it head on.

892
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:45,465
The real truth is what?

893
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:52,139
There is something rotten inside of me.

894
00:49:53,348 --> 00:49:55,307
I find it near impossible

895
00:49:55,309 --> 00:49:59,603
to drown out the constant cacophony
of voices whispering in my ear,

896
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:03,064
telling me I am evil.

897
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,761
I'm drowning, doctor!

898
00:50:06,361 --> 00:50:09,057
And I can't stop asking myself...

899
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,073
why do I hate myself so much?
