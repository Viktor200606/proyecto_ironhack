1
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:05,964
How's your mom
holding up?

2
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:09,134
She's doing okay, but we just
lost another nurse.

3
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:10,369
How many is that now?

4
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:12,037
Two, and I know what
you're thinking--

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,206
she's eating them.

6
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:18,543
She's just so impossible,
they keep quitting.

7
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,145
So, who's
watching her now?

8
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:23,749
A bowl full of M&M's with
a few Ambien tossed in.

9
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:25,317
What up, guys?

10
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:26,585
Hello. - Hey.  -Hello.

11
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:28,620
Okay.

12
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:30,122
Well, now that
everyone's here,

13
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:32,758
Penny and I have
some big news.

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,559
We're engaged!

15
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:43,235
And I thought me having sex with
Emily was gonna be the big news.

16
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:48,774
Hey! Hey!

17
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:51,977
What the hell!

18
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:53,779
You guys propose all the time.

19
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:56,081
This never happens.

20
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,549

31
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:32,489
Boy, I'm so
hungry today.

32
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:35,258
I wonder why?

33
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:38,495
Because you had sex
the other night?

34
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:40,664
You know what?

35
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,367
That may be it.

36
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:46,937
By the way,
it isn't like riding a bike.

37
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,106
Like, I fell off a few times.

38
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:52,275
Hey, buddy.

39
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:54,111
Hello.

40
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,379
You okay?

41
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,147
I just got called

42
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,516
into President Siebert's office.

43
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:01,051
The university

44
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:04,921
won't let me switch my field of
study to inflationary cosmology.

45
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:08,058
They're forcing me
to continue with string theory.

46
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,693
Why?

47
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:11,161
He said it's why they hired me,

48
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,397
it's-it's what my grant
was designated for,

49
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,967
and that everybody has to do
things they don't want to do.

50
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,302
He then gave an example
of something he had to do,

51
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:20,437
even though he didn't want to,

52
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:23,507
which was look
at my stupid face.

53
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,675
That's a rude thing to say.

54
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:28,044
Out loud.

55
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:31,715
It's an outrage.

56
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:34,050
Honestly, I'm tempted
to leave the university.

57
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:36,119
You know, if you're really
serious about that,

58
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:38,522
I hear there are
some exciting opportunities

59
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:41,858
in home care
for the old and fat.

60
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,295
Whatever you do, just don't
make any rash decisions.

61
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:46,530
I don't know.

62
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:48,265
I am really aggravated.

63
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:52,135
When I'm feeling low,
I have sex with a girl.

64
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:55,705
But that's just me.

65
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:01,344
Oh, come on, give her a chance.
No.

66
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:03,079
Life, it is too short.

67
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:06,183
I know you've only been
here a day and a half,

68
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,818
but you're like
part of the family!

69
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:13,590
I don't think the service is
gonna send any more people.

70
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:18,862
Yeah, maybe it's time we just
release Ma back into the sea.

71
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:22,766
That's not helpful.

72
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:25,702
Well, then, we may need
to get used to the idea

73
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:29,206
that we're gonna be living
here the next few months.

74
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,474
But we have jobs.

75
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,609
We can't baby-sit her
24 hours a day.

76
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:35,412
Well, what if we use
our vacation time?

77
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:39,349
I wanted to go to Hawaii,
not Hell.

78
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:41,418
I don't know
what else we can do.

79
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,988
Howie, I love you,

80
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,123
and as your wife, your
mother is every bit

81
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,093
as much my problem as
she is yours, so...

82
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:53,497
I want a divorce.

83
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:58,468
Hello, Leonard.

84
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,936
Hi, Mom.

85
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:02,005
I have some exciting news.

86
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,774
I'm listening.

87
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:07,577
Before I tell you,
will you promise to try

88
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,581
and be happy for me and keep any
concerns you have to yourself?

89
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,617
No.

90
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:18,855
Let me save you
all of your hemming and hawing.

91
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:22,292
Sheldon already told me
that you and Penny are engaged.

92
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:26,563
I-I hate that you talk to him
more than you talk to me.

93
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:29,432
Would you <i>like</i> for you and me
to talk more?

94
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:33,803
You know what?
It's probably fine.

95
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:37,841
In any event, while I've had
my misgivings about...

96
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:40,043
Penny...

97
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:43,380
...Sheldon spoke
very fondly of her,

98
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,615
and if she is good enough
for him,

99
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,884
then she's good enough for me.

100
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:51,221
I'm your son.

101
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:54,190
What about the fact
that she's good enough for me?

102
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,661
Sure.

103
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,663
Thanks, Mom.

104
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,665
Leonard,
would it make you feel better

105
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:06,503
to hear that your mother
approved of your life choices?

106
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,472
Yes, it would.

107
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:13,176
Yeah. Well,
you should work on that.

108
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,648
No, Mom, it's the same guy

109
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,384
I've been going out with
for the past two years.

110
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:23,453
Yeah, the scientist.

111
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:24,821
Well, it's complicated.

112
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:28,325
I mean, he works with lasers
and atomic magnets.

113
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:33,196
No, I did not see it coming.

114
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:37,400
No, we did not set a date.

115
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:40,704
Yeah, this is a first
for our family.

116
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,572
All right, tell Dad I love him.

117
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:43,607
I gotta go.

118
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,708
All right, bye.

119
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,809
Atomic magnets?

120
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:46,943
Shut up.

121
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:50,080
Sorry I'm late.

122
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:53,883
The leaf blower broke, so I had
to hand-dry my mother-in-law.

123
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:56,386
You want some wine?

124
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,320
Thanks.

125
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,089
Little warning
before you jump into

126
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:00,090
this marriage business:

127
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,391
You're not just marrying him,

128
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:02,659
you're marrying his family.

129
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:05,061
I think Leonard's mom's okay
with me.

130
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,396
It doesn't matter
if she's okay with you.

131
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,832
The question is: Can she go
to the bathroom by herself?

132
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:16,139
Hit me again.

133
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:20,543
So, what are the living
arrangements gonna be?

134
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:22,746
Well, haven't really talked
about it yet, but I figure,

135
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:25,415
at some point, I'll move in with
him, or he'll move in with me.

136
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:28,151
Well, with you not working,
that makes financial sense.

137
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,486
You're not working!

138
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:32,055
How would you like a job
in home health care?

139
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:34,157
Not a chance.

140
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,859
Please. I'm desperate.
No.

141
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:38,294
I'll pay you anything you want.
Okay, then, yeah.

142
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:41,998
No! Keep your money!

143
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:48,972
I could've ridden a bull
longer than that.

144
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,843
What you working on?

145
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:55,845
I'm writing an appeal

146
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,080
to the Faculty Senate,

147
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,049
so that I can move on
from string theory.

148
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,517
Oh. How's it going?

149
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,986
You tell me.

150
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,889
"Dear Esteemed Colleagues,

151
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,657
"As you may know,
I have requested

152
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:09,292
"to change my field of study.

153
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:10,794
"My decision
to do so

154
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:13,129
"is, I believe,
in the best interest of science.

155
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,199
"At your convenience, I'd be
happy to explain it to you

156
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:19,035
in words you'll understand."

157
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:23,106
It's nice
that you called them "esteemed."

158
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,742
You're right.
I'll take that out.

159
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:30,647
So, listen, there was something
I was hoping to float past you.

160
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:32,348
Mm.
Now that Penny and I are engaged,

161
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,618
I thought we might want to talk
about our living arrangements.

162
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,654
Of course.

163
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:40,423
She's spent many nights here,
and you're worried

164
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:45,028
about preserving the myth of her
virginity before the wedding.

165
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,798
I'm not.

166
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,734
Good, because not only has
that ship sailed,

167
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:54,270
if it hit an iceberg,
countless men would perish.

168
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:58,174
Actually, this is about where
she and I are going to live.

169
00:07:58,176 --> 00:07:59,676
What do you mean?

170
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,746
Well... well, we might want
to live together.

171
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:06,149
Oh, yeah, well, I've already
given this some thought,

172
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,317
and...

173
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,386
I'm willing
to let Penny live with us

174
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:13,523
one day a week
for a trial period.

175
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:18,128
Now, obviously,
not when she's made cranky

176
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,331
by the shedding
of her uterine lining.

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,367
That's very sweet.

178
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:30,306
But we were thinking more of us
maybe living together with...

179
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:32,509
not you.

180
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:37,380
I don't understand.

181
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,818
How could we all live together
if I'm not there?

182
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,888
Look, I-I know
this is... this is change,

183
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,890
and that sounds scary, but...

184
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,525
Where are you going to go?

185
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,093
I don't know.

186
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,961
We just started
to think about this.

187
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:53,496
Maybe I'll move
in with Penny,

188
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,598
or maybe she and
I'll take this place,

189
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,900
and you can move
across the hall.

190
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:59,235
Move across the hall?!

191
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:02,705
Did you take a marijuana?!

192
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:06,910
No, I did not.

193
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:09,646
Did you get hit
on the head with a coconut?

194
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,481
No.
Well, then,

195
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:12,916
I'm all out of guesses.

196
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,284
What? Me move across the hall--

197
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:16,419
Why would you even suggest
such a thing?

198
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:17,787
Because I love Penny,

199
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,223
and want to give her
the life she deserves.

200
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:22,192
I see.

201
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,461
You're putting your future
bride's happiness above mine.

202
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:30,200
Well, yeah.

203
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,635
Wow.

204
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:46,039
How dare the university force me
to go back to string theory!

205
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,774
They just don't appreciate you.

206
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,244
Yeah, and on top of that,
Leonard has the audacity

207
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:52,746
to suggest that now
that he and Penny are engaged,

208
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:54,882
he may not want
to live with me anymore.

209
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:57,050
Here, I made you some
Strawberry Quik.

210
00:09:57,052 --> 00:09:58,886
I have real problems here, Amy.

211
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:01,755
I can't be mollified with a
beverage designed for children.

212
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:04,224
Mmm! Yummy.

213
00:10:05,593 --> 00:10:07,995
You know, this might
work out for the best.

214
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:09,563
I mean, you're
always complaining

215
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,498
about what a terrible
roommate Leonard is.

216
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,799
Like how he turns up

217
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,201
the thermostat when
you're not there.

218
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:17,371
Ugh! It's like walking
into the Amazon.

219
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:19,873
And not the good Amazon
with one-day shipping.

220
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,143
The awful one
with birds and snakes.

221
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:26,179
You hate the sound of all
those keys on his key chain.

222
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:28,215
Four keys!

223
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:30,350
Who does he think
he is, a warden?

224
00:10:31,452 --> 00:10:34,321
See? Maybe you'll
love living alone.

225
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:37,024
I don't know. Perhaps.

226
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:39,493
And if it turns
out you don't...

227
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:41,395
you and I could
live together.

228
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:43,830
You and... Oh, sure.

229
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:45,265
And while we're at it,

230
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:46,767
why don't we get engaged, too?

231
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:49,002
Why don't we get a little house,
start a family?

232
00:10:49,004 --> 00:10:50,437
Enjoy our sunset years together?

233
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:53,340
Do you hear yourself, woman?!

234
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:56,176
Sheldon, it was just a thought.
No.

235
00:10:56,178 --> 00:10:57,177
Here's a thought.

236
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,245
You're not moving in,

237
00:10:58,247 --> 00:10:59,346
Leonard's not moving out,

238
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:05,185
everything stays
exactly the way it is.

239
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:06,820
and you're supposed
to use the powder!

240
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:09,189
It tastes the same.

241
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:11,692
No. The syrup tastes better
and I don't like it.

242
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:16,897
This is so sweet!

243
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,665
You never cook for me.
Well...

244
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:21,635
you cook for me
all the time and...

245
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:24,171
Ugh.

246
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:25,672
If you don't like my cooking,

247
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:27,074
why haven't you ever
said anything?

248
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:31,111
It's hard to talk with
so much heavy chewing to do.

249
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:33,213
Sorry. I'll get better.

250
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:37,017
I know you'll try.

251
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,953
So, should we talk
about setting a date?

252
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:41,622
Well, I'd like
to pick one that works

253
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:42,689
with my brother's schedule.

254
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:44,324
Okay.
And when would that be?

255
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:47,728
Uh, 12 to 18 months from now,
depending on good behavior.

256
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,765
Hi, is Sheldon here?

257
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:53,133
No, I thought he was with you.

258
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:55,035
He was, but he stormed off

259
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:57,471
and now he isn't answering his phone.
What happened?

260
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:59,673
He was really angry
that you suggested he move out.

261
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,074
Oh.

262
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:02,643
I also mentioned that he and I
could live together

263
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:04,177
but he was too mad at you
to realize

264
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:06,079
what a great idea that is.

265
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:10,484
Well, he's been having
a couple of tough days.

266
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:11,685
I'm sure he's fine.
He probably just

267
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,487
needs a little alone
time to decompress.

268
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:15,489
You're probably right.

269
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:18,091
So, what are you guys doing?

270
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:22,896
Well, Leonard cooked for me
and now we're just having

271
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:27,034
a nice dinner, you know,
as a newly engaged couple.

272
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:29,436
That's nice.

273
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,976
Anyway, as I was saying,

274
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:39,279
Sheldon probably just needs
a little alone time.

275
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:41,274
'Cause that's important.

276
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:48,455
Not just for him, but for...

277
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:50,724
most anybody, really.

278
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:52,559
Don't I know it.

279
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:53,694
What is that, polenta?

280
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:55,328
Amy, get out.
Right.

281
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:02,836
No.

282
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:07,808
Hey, Sheldon.

283
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,476
What happened?

284
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:11,344
I was cooking
in the back room last night

285
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:12,979
and the hot plate
caught on fire.

286
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:15,682
And you couldn't put it out?

287
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:16,917
I was across the street

288
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:19,619
at the do-it-yourself car wash,
taking a shower.

289
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,725
So when will you reopen?

290
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:26,059
Um, I don't know.

291
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:29,496
I'm waiting to hear back
from the insurance company.

292
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:32,065
So, tomorrow?

293
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:35,202
I don't mean to be rude,
Sheldon, but, uh,

294
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:37,104
my life is kind of
falling apart right now.

295
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:39,005
<i>Your</i> life?

296
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:41,541
The university is making
me do string theory

297
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:45,245
and my girlfriend loves me so
much she wants to live with me.

298
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:46,947
And now,

299
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:51,084
the place I need to go when I'm
sad is damp and smells funny.

300
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,788
Well, sorry I let you down.

301
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,089
No.

302
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:57,524
I do not accept this.

303
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:59,793
Everything is changing
and I hate it.

304
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,027
It stops now.

305
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:02,929
I'm helping you
get back on your feet.

306
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:08,702
I would like to purchase
this comic book, please.

307
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:11,071
That'll be $2.99.

308
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:13,774
Really? It's soaking wet.

309
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,976
Fine, a dollar.

310
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,313
Can you break a 20?

311
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:22,382
No, I only have hundreds.

312
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:25,652
You know what?

313
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:28,188
I don't always recognize
sarcasm, but I do right now,

314
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,357
and I don't appreciate it.

315
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,792
I'm sorry for your loss.

316
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:34,561
But you're not the only one
whose day has been a disaster.

317
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,871
That could have killed me.

318
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:48,108
I can't catch a break.

319
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:51,945
I haven't heard
from Sheldon in a while.

320
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:53,146
You think he's okay?

321
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:54,481
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

322
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:56,416
I'm gonna see where he is.

323
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:58,518
How?

324
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,921
Oh, I know his password,
so I can track his phone.

325
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:02,522
You do that?

326
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:05,492
Not always, but ever since he
wandered off at the swap meet

327
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:08,829
chasing a balloon,
I get worried.

328
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:10,330
He can take care of himself.

329
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:11,798
Look, we went over
stranger danger

330
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,334
and gave him that whistle.

331
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:16,469
That's weird.

332
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:19,039
What?
He's at the train station.

333
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,607
So? He loves trains.

334
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:22,609
It's dark out and he's
alone, I don't like it.

335
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:23,844
Let's go get him.

336
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:26,012
Oh, it's sweet how you
look out for him.

337
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:27,180
You're a good guy.

338
00:15:27,182 --> 00:15:28,448
It's not just that.

339
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,151
My mother would kill me if I let
something happen to him.

340
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:38,458
Dude, I'm so sorry.

341
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,759
Don't take this
the wrong way,

342
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:42,529
but did you do this
for the insurance money?

343
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:45,866
No. God, you sound like
the police, the firemen,

344
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:48,969
my parents, my therapist
and the insurance company.

345
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:52,606
We're here for you, man.
Whatever you need, okay?

346
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:53,907
Uh, actually, I was
wondering if I could

347
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:55,609
crash at your place
for a few nights.

348
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:57,043
Sure, of course.

349
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:58,778
Oh, actually, Emily was
gonna spend the night.

350
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,715
You slept with her? Nice.

351
00:16:01,717 --> 00:16:03,483
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

352
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:05,652
She let me do it
to her, but...

353
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:10,190
Uh, but I can always
call her and cancel.

354
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,626
Hang on. I know
a place you can stay

355
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:14,794
and earn some money
at the same time.

356
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:16,897
Great.
I just have to warn you,

357
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:21,067
it'll involve humiliation,
degradation and verbal abuse.

358
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:24,437
So what's the catch?

359
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:32,178
Sheldon.

360
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,014
You tracked my phone?

361
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:35,348
Yeah.

362
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,352
Boy, you chase one balloon
for three miles.

363
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:43,423
We were worried
about you.

364
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:45,458
Don't be melodramatic.

365
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,762
I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

366
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:50,764
Seriously?

367
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:52,165
You don't even have
a change of clothes

368
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,533
or a toothbrush.

369
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:56,503
My plan is to stop at malls
and buy what I need.

370
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,672
It's called
living off the land.

371
00:16:58,674 --> 00:17:01,041
Okay, I know you're upset

372
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:03,009
and there's a lot
of stuff going on,

373
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:04,644
but it's nothing
we can't work out.

374
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:06,112
Come on, let's get you home.

375
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:08,148
No. I've reached
my breaking point.

376
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,116
I need to leave. Now.

377
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:11,518
And go where?

378
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,886
It doesn't matter.

379
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:16,122
So a few things
don't go your way

380
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:20,260
and your best decision is to
ride the rails like a hobo?

381
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:23,797
I suppose it is.

382
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,865
Except I have a credit card.

383
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:29,336
And I refuse to carry
my laptop at the end of a stick.

384
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:35,141
And I'd sooner die
than eat beans out of a can.

385
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:37,610
Come on, come home with us

386
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:39,346
and tomorrow I'll-I'll
take you to Legoland.

387
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:42,349
Legoland is not
the solution to everything.

388
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,551
And it's too much of a scene

389
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:46,753
since that movie came out.

390
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:49,789
Then what can I do?

391
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,125
Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

392
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,895
Everything is changing
and it's simply too much.

393
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:57,497
I need to get away and think.

394
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:59,432
Oh, c-come on, you know
you're overreacting.

395
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:00,934
Leonard, hang on.

396
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:04,104
Just... come here
for a second.

397
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:07,340
Maybe we need to let him go.

398
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:09,142
What?! Why?

399
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,410
It might be good for him.

400
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:11,344
Y-You know he can't

401
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:13,346
take a trip like this
by himself.

402
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:14,647
He's a grown man.

403
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:17,217
No, he <i>looks</i> like a grown man.

404
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:20,553
You've seen
<i>Freaky Friday,</i> sometimes

405
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:23,656
little kids end up
in big person bodies.

406
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:26,760
Leonard, we can't
protect him forever.

407
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:28,261
I know, but...

408
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:29,829
He'll be okay.

409
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:31,197
You taught him
well, Padawan.

410
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,899
Good Lord!

411
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:36,636
Padawan's the student,
not the teacher.

412
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:40,206
Seriously, let him go.

413
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,647
Sheldon, if you really
need to do this,

414
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:49,182
I'm not gonna
stand in your way.

415
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:51,551
I do.

416
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:54,254
Okay.

417
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:55,855
Good luck.

418
00:18:59,894 --> 00:19:02,896
Be safe and call us.

419
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:06,533
I will.

420
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:10,003
Bye, buddy.

421
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,442
Sheldon...

422
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:17,510
Yes?

423
00:19:17,512 --> 00:19:20,180
I'm gonna miss you.

424
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:23,716
Of course you are.

425
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:28,688
He just made that easier.
Mm.

426
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:41,452
Hey!

427
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:45,323
What are you guys
still doing here?

428
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:46,991
I got this, go. Go home.

429
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,728
You sure?

430
00:19:51,764 --> 00:19:53,231
Yeah, she's fed,
she took her pills,

431
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,633
she's all tucked in
and watching TV.

432
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:56,868
So, she's not
too much for you?

433
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,804
Are you kidding?
I love her, she's great.

434
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:02,373
Stewie, you gonna watch

435
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,042
<i>Wheel of Fortune</i> with me?

436
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:06,311
Coming, Debbie.

437
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,414
You call her Debbie?

438
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,848
She insisted.

439
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,484
So, hey, guys,
thank you so much.

440
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:15,687
This job is a dream come true.

441
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,195
Was that a little weird?

442
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:26,064
Yeah. I don't know why,

443
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,900
but something
about it feels...

444
00:20:28,902 --> 00:20:32,837
unnatural.

445
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:35,974
Okay, let's go.
Yep.

446
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:39,644
Okay, Sheldon,
thanks for checking in.

447
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:41,579
Talk to you tomorrow?

448
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:44,282
O-Okay, bye.

449
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,817
He's okay?

450
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:47,819
Actually sounds like
he's doing pretty well.

451
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:50,321
I really think
this is gonna be for the best.

452
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:51,756
Me, too.

453
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:53,791
And he was able
to take a sabbatical from...

454
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,697
How could you let him go?!
