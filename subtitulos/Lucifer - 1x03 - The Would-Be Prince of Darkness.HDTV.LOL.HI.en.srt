00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:04,796
LUCIFER: Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,250
So you're the Devil, and
you've left Hell behind

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:09,986
to take a vacation in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:11,120
How could you possibly help me?

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,121
I have a certain skill set.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,590
I can be very persuasive with people.

7
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:16,025
I got it, the name, the
whole "Lucifer" thing,

8
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:17,927
and desire is like your superpower.

9
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:20,029
- (Lucifer groans)
- CHLOE: How did you survive

10
00:00:20,097 --> 00:00:21,497
getting shot six times?

11
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:22,685
Is that your normal reaction

12
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:23,666
to someone saving your life?

13
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,100
When I see something I can't explain,

14
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,268
yeah, I look for answers.

15
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:28,016
Well, I've given you
the answer, Detective.

16
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:29,471
It's not my fault you won't accept it.

17
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:30,539
CHLOE: What happened with Lucifer?

18
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:31,707
You don't get it, do you?

19
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:33,842
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

20
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,144
LUCIFER: Where's your
ex, Detective Douche?

21
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:37,157
Hi, Daddy.

22
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,112
Hi, munchkin.

23
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,414
CHLOE: Wow, shocker, you're late.

24
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,048
Come on, give me a break.

25
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:42,250
Right, here's the deal.

26
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:45,587
We can have as much naked
cuddle time as you desire,

27
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,622
but you're gonna
have to listen to me too.

28
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,357
LINDA: You like to hide insecurity

29
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,458
in humor, don't you?

30
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:51,966
What do you think I'm insecure about?

31
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:53,661
That you are changing,

32
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,362
that you don't know what's
causing the change.

33
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,331
Or who.

34
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:01,081
_

35
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:05,520
_

36
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,994
_

37
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:11,877
(wind whistling)

38
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:29,827
Go on.

39
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:32,364
Go ahead, jump.

40
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,100
You know you want to.

41
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:37,902
Hmm?

42
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,105
Trust me, it's a warm welcome.

43
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,374
Won't it hurt?

44
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:45,909
Oh, there's only one way to find out.

45
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,319
- (cheering, shouting)
- ♪ All day I was out ♪

46
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:58,756
♪ Feeling, thinking of you... ♪

47
00:01:58,823 --> 00:01:59,823
Lovely.

48
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:04,894
♪ Buzzing by myself tonight ♪

49
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:06,596

- Excuse me.

52

WOMAN: You're the man of the hour.

00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,008
Everyone's here to see you.

57
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:22,311
What's the worst that can happen?

58
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,912
Come on, have one drink with me.

59
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,947
I can't, I'm sorry, I'm
not trying to be a buzzkill,

60
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,549
I'm just... I'm not in
the mood to party, all right?

61
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:30,151
How can you decline this ravishing siren's

62
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,953
invitation to imbibe?

63
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:35,424
(chuckles) Well, if
L.A.'s taught me anything,

64
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,758
constant rejections do build character.

65
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,460
LUCIFER: Sincerely
doubt "constant rejection"

66
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:41,061
is something you ever deal with.

67
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,330
(chuckles)

68
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:44,332
You could learn a
thing or two from this guy.

69
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,334
Oh. (chuckles)

70
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,068
Witty, charming and wise.

71
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,169
Have you lost your mind?

72
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,938
Do I know you?

73
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,172
Lucifer.

74
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,406
Morningstar.

75
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,275
Right, you're the club owner guy

76
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,510
who grants people favors.

77
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,246
Yeah, I don't need anything from you.

78
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,349
Oh, I beg to differ, Ty.

79
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,750
I have been looking for you all night.

80
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,752
And you are in desperate need of my help.

81
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,455
Star quarterback, number-one
draft pick,

82
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,223
and yet, for some
inexplicable reason, a virgin.

83
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,991
Look, man, I got all the
haters I need online, all right?

84
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,427
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not criticizing.

85
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,528
I'm fascinated.

86
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,130
I mean, do you know how rare you are?

87
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,633
A celebrity virgin in Los Angeles,

88
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,134
and surrounded by temptation.

89
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,371
I mean, you, Ty, are like

90
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,772
a four-leaf clover and
a unicorn made a baby.

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,241
Without, uh, having sex, of course.

92
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:31,909
(wry chuckle)

93
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:33,043
MAN: Aw, thanks, I appreciate it.

94
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:34,645
My agent wanted me to throw this party.

95
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:35,980
Oh.

96
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:38,516
- Yeah, he wants me to loosen up.
- He's right.

97
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,017
I've met your type before,

98
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:41,619
so desperate to control their lives,

99
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:42,953
they forget to enjoy it.

100
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,188
So answer me this.

101
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:48,892
If you were to ever, you know, let go,

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,561
what is it you'd really want to do?

103
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,497
I, uh...

104
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:55,432
- Yeah.
- I...

105
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,768
I want to skip my
morning workout sometimes.

106
00:03:57,835 --> 00:04:00,003
- Boring.
- Just chill on the couch

107
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,070
and watch Master Chef.

108
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:02,505
This is the fantasy life

109
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:03,773
of a postmenopausal housewife.

110
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,275
Come on, Ty, there must
be something deeper.

111
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:07,777
I, um...

112
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:09,645
Yeah.

113
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:11,781
I want to get laid so damn bad.

114
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,682
(laughing) And there it is.

115
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,185
You got no idea how hard it
is holding out for marriage, man.

116
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:19,253
Uncomfortably hard, I'm sure.

117
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:21,055
(both chuckle)

118
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:22,791
Look, I was going to with my girl,

119
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,526
but, uh, we broke up.

120
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:25,593
Oh...

121
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:26,528
I thought she was gonna be

122
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:27,829
the mother of my children.

123
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:29,857
Well, she wants to be the
mother of your children.

124
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:31,800
Come on, Ty, it's the fourth quarter,

125
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,968
but you can still win this game.

126
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:36,036
I mean, look at her, death and taxes

127
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:37,438
are less of a sure thing.

128
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:38,672
No, I can't.

129
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,940
But you desire her.

130
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:41,341
Why fight it?

131
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,177
Because my mother taught me that...

132
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:46,413
Oh, no, don't-don't bring
her into this that's disgusting.

133
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:49,416
Uh... it's about you.

134
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:50,951
What do you want?

135
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:53,085
Her.

136
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:55,421
Well, then "carpe diem," my friend.

137
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:04,831
Ah, hello again, my little cannonball.

138
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:06,833
Sorry, I didn't introduce myself earlier.

139
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,601

140
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:09,601
Seriously?

141
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,836
Yes, yes.

142
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:12,971
I'm the Devil, hope
you'll hold it against me.

143
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,274
Lucifer Morningstar,
the guy who owns Lux?

144
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:17,175

146
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,345
I've seen him before.

147
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:21,580
His beats are sick.

148
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:23,348
I very much beg your pardon.

149
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:24,415
Beats?

150
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,617
Yeah.

151
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:27,451
He performed at a rap
battle last week in the Valley.

152
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,955
Every single part of
that sentence horrifies me.

153
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:32,957
It is so gross

154
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,392

Is Lucifer a magician?

184
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,371
That's sort of what I'm
trying to figure out.

185
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,041
When Daddy gets here, maybe he can help.

186
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:03,141
Mm.

187
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,710
Sometimes Daddy helps
me with my homework.

188
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:07,245
I'm not sure if Daddy has the
answers to these questions.

189
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:09,480
Why don't you just ask Lucifer?

190
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:12,817
Because if he's a magician,
then he won't reveal his secrets.

191
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,620
So I have to find out on
my own how Lucifer does...

192
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:19,057
- (cell phone rings, buzzes)
- these things that I can't...

193
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,092
explain.

194
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,160
Oh, that can't be him.

195
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:24,495
(phone beeps on)

196
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:25,563
Decker.

197
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:28,765
Lucifer, how did you
even get this number?

198
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:33,103
LUCIFER: Excuse the mess,

199
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,106
but it's so good of you to
come, Detective Decker.

200
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:40,110
Thanks for being
super-cryptic in a really unhelpful way.

201
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:41,411
- (chuckles)
- What's the emergency?

202
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,113
Well, it's-it's better
to show than tell, really.

203
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,089
I...

CORONER: Petechial grows
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

206
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,147
Contusions on the neck.

207
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:13,414
Signs of strangulation.

208
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:16,684
And one of the victim's
fake nails was ripped off.

209
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:17,752
Signs of struggle.

210
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,720
We got a murder on our hands.

211
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:22,256
Thanks.

212
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:24,959
CHLOE: So what happened?

213
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:27,627
TY: Um, well, I woke up
early, 'cause my head hurt.

214
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:28,695
I, uh...

215
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:30,430
I had a hangover.

216
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:32,166
I... I've never drank before, so...

217
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:34,668
That's on me. Sorry.

218
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:36,269
Yeah, so I came down to get some water,

219
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:38,004
and that's-that's when
I saw her in the pool.

220
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:39,072
Did you know her?

221
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:40,573
Not before last night.

222
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,308
I talked to her for a little bit.

223
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:44,310
Her name was, uh...

224
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:45,678
Ali, maybe?

225
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:48,748
I don't know. I mean, I'm
having a hard time remembering.

226
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:52,918
You think she accidentally slipped,

227
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:54,319
fell in the pool and drowned?

228
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:55,720
No, I think she was murdered.

229
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,722
Oh, my God, that's... that's terrible.

230
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,725
So why didn't you call
the police right away?

231
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:02,294
Well, I told Lucifer.

232
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:03,929
He said... he said that
he would call the police.

233
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:04,997
LUCIFER: And I did.

234
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:06,831
Detective Decker's a homicide detective.

235
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,000
She's been very helpful

236
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:11,369
in the other murders
that I've encountered.

237
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:14,238
I am not your personal police concierge.

238
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:15,973
You are gonna find out
who did this, aren't you?

239
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,241
(inhales)

240
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,210
Of course I am, because that's my job.

241
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:20,677
- Right.
- Not because you want me to.

242
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,213
(scoffs) Right.

243
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,801
First things last. Do you have any idea

244
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:25,116
who had contact with her last night?

245
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:28,851
Um, no, uh, no, but they asked
me to get the... the guest list.

246
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,289
(quietly) Oh, geez.

247
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:33,589
250 guests.

248
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,791
You know what that means.

249
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:36,226
Great party.

250
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:40,230
250 suspects.

251
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:43,299
Oh. Uh, I'd be careful with that thing

252
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,599
in the guest bedroom.

253
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,147
There's a good chance you'll go blind.

254
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,636
Unspeakable acts.

255
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:49,972
Yes, we got a little
carried away. (chuckles)

256
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,341
Stop interfering.

257
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:53,608
I'm helping.

258
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,910
You forget that my expertise

259
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,745
is finding the right
people to punish, Detective.

260
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:57,546
It's what I do.

261
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,448
Or, uh, did, at least.

262
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,982
You want to do something?

263
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,151
Then help account for
everyone who was at the party.

264
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:04,885
- Oh.
- Coroner puts the time of death

265
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,154
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.

266
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:07,388
Actually, is there someone

267
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:09,296
who can vouch for your
whereabouts at the time?

268
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,192
Several someones, in fact.

269
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,293
Yes.

270
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,395
Get them to tell you every little detail

271
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,130
just to make sure that I'm not lying.

272
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,132
I'll have someone else handle that.

273
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,469
So... a bona fide killer on the
loose that needs to be punished.

274
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:23,494
Time to punch in.

275
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:25,305
There she is.

276
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:27,774
Do you know anyone here?

277
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:29,576
No. Sorry.

278
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,578
I mean, people just
show up to these things.

279
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:33,246
Did anyone look suspicious?

280
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:34,750
(scoffs) Where do we start, Detective?

281
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,648
I mean, look at those big strong hands.

282
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,516
Perfect for squeezing
the life out of someone.

283
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:41,187
Oh, ginger lad.

284
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:42,455
Soulless bastards.

285
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,190
Give even me the creeps.

286
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:45,458
I...

287
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,326
You need to sit with the witnesses.

288
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:49,462
LUCIFER: Haven't I proven myself

289
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,809
extremely useful at detectiving?

290
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:53,999
Actually, no, I don't need
your help color-commentating.

291
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,600
I need facts and hard evidence.

292
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,103
So unless you can help
me with either, stay.

293
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,072
But I don't want to be stuck
out here with these miscreants.

294
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,673
These are your people.

295
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:04,923
Detective!

296
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,224
Hey.

297
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,558
I heard all hands on deck.

298
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:23,360
I came as quick as I could.

299
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:24,895
Yeah, and on time.

300
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,331
Look, Chloe, I'm sorry
about earlier, okay?

301
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,965
I got held up at an arrest in Hollywood.

302
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:31,100
I couldn't get away.

303
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,168
I get it, Dan.

304
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,369
Save the apologies for Trixie.

305
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:34,703
This is work, and right now,

306
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:36,639
we have a victim with
no fingerprints on file.

307
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:39,342
These all the unclaimed
items from the party?

308
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,044
Yeah, I checked everything.

309
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,611
Unfortunately, no I.D.
that matches our victim.

310
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,113
So, what are you thinking?

311
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:48,216
Well, I'm thinking our victim

312
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:50,419
wore a cute red dress.

313
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:53,221
There's no way she'd
have that pink clutch.

314
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:54,523
She was out to have fun,

315
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,125
so that nixes anything
big and bulky, like a tote.

316
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:59,193
I don't know.

317
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,062
I'm looking for something small,

318
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,229
a little sexy...

319
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:04,098
classy.

320
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,667
Something like this.

321
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:07,935
Wait a minute, I-I thought you said

322
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:09,303
all this stuff was
searched already for I.D.

323
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:10,871
I'm not looking for an I.D.

324
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,173
I'm looking for a car.

325
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,709
(car alarm chirps)

326
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,010
Ali Thornton, 23, from Boise, Idaho.

327
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,399
Her info matches the registration

328
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:20,680
we found in the glove box.

329
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:21,747
Hmm.

330
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,550
She was a long way from home.

331
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:26,619
What were you doing here, Ali?

332
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:29,255
I'll see what I can find on her.

333
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:30,423
Detectives,

334
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:31,971
found something in the master bedroom.

335
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,830
Found this here in the bed.

336
00:12:38,898 --> 00:12:42,434
And it matches the missing
fingernail of the victim.

337
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:45,003
Isn't this Ty's bedroom?

338
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:50,441
Yeah, looks like they
did a lot more than talk.

339
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,510
(woman moaning passionately nearby)

340
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:58,916
(Lucifer moans with pleasure,
as woman's moans continue)

341
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:00,884
What the hell are you doing?

342
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:03,488
Well, since you banished
me outside with the lepers,

343
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,623
I decided to make myself useful.

344
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,458
You call watching porn
on your phone useful?

345
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,227
This isn't my phone, Detective.

346
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:12,329
I think it's our recently departed's.

347
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,001
Where did you get this?

348
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:19,908
Just heard a ringy-ding
and followed the noise.

349
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:20,807
Now, is delete the little

350
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:21,562
- rubbish bin?
- No.

351
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:23,673
You can't delete anything on this phone.

352
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:25,374
But it shows Ty and Ali having sex.

353
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:26,942
It's very distracting.

354
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,010
(quietly) Wait.

355
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:29,211
Ooh, you've reached the money shot?

356
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,514
Are you taping this?

357
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:35,117
TY: I don't know.

358
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:37,186
Over there, we had a drink.

359
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:39,522
And I didn't know the girl that well.

360
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,258

369

380
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:30,270
Ty had a squeaky-clean image.

381
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:32,439
He sleeps with a girl.

382
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,107

383
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:35,776

You saw the video.

386
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:40,046
The only thing that that video proves

387
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:41,180
is that Ty had sex.

388
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,282
He was horny, not murderous.

389
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,590
Then why would he lie about it?

390
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,218
Blame the tequila.

391
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,454

00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,054
Why? I didn't even go to the party.

542
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:08,454
I had to work.

543
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:10,623
CHLOE: You spoke to the victim a
few hours before she was killed.

544
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:14,427
Maybe it's best if I don't say
anything without my attorney.

545
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:16,196
Joey! Joe, Joe.

546
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,564
There's no need for that.

547
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:19,499
Why don't you

548
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,567
tell me what you really want, hmm?

549
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:25,637
What desires drive a
man such as yourself?

550
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:32,011
I want to be the greatest
agent of all time.

551
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,645
Really?

552
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:34,814
And to do that,

553
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:38,016
I need to protect my clients.

554
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:39,818
Come on.

555
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:42,954
And, uh...

556
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:45,757
If you want to protect
Ty, tell us what you know.

557
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,997
(chuckles) Let's make a deal.

558
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,933
I'll tell you everything.
You look into something.

559
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Here's a deal.

560
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:58,301
Tell us everything, and I don't

561
00:20:58,369 --> 00:20:59,703
cuff you in front of your
co-workers and take you in.

562
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:00,971
I know how this goes.

563
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,240
Ali's a young actress
looking for a break.

564
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:05,843
An agent promises to
help her out, in exchange,

565
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,230
she's treated them like a party
favor to your star clients.

566
00:21:08,246 --> 00:21:09,980
Okay, okay.

567
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:12,481
I did call Ali.

568
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:14,583
I hired her to have sex with Ty.

569
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:16,152
Wow, seems I wasn't the only one

570
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,755
who wanted the young
virgin to loosen up.

571
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:20,656
No, I loved the virgin angle.

572
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:23,159
It's a clean hook, got
him a lot of attention.

573
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:27,396
But Ty was a mess.

574
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:28,764
I needed him

575
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:31,099
to get over his ex.

576
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,234
Why?

577
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,771
Geez.

578
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,606
Popular boy, this Ty... isn't he?

579
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:41,509
So what, did this anger
his ex or something?

580
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:44,880
No, it's from his ex,

581
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:46,914
Debra Macall. She left this behind

582
00:21:46,982 --> 00:21:48,548
one of the many times she came here

583
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:49,984
trying to find him.

584
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,752
She used to call all the time
trying to get a hold of him.

585
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,087
So, he dated a crazy fan?

586
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:55,189
He didn't know it at the beginning.

587
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:57,925
So when I figured it out, he
had already fallen for her.

588
00:21:57,993 --> 00:22:00,394
Oh, suppose I can understand why.

589
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:01,628
(chuckles)

590
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,529
JOE: See, after a while,
Debra got possessive,

591
00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:04,597
controlling...

592
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:06,199
she thought she was managing him.

593
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:08,401
So I told Ty he needed
to break up with her.

594
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:09,936
He refused.

595
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,672
I made Ty file a restraining order

596
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:14,274
after she broke a girl's nose

597
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:15,574
just for buying him a mojito.

598
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:17,243
Quite a hair trigger on this Debra,

599
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:19,279
- by the sounds of it.
- Hmm.

600
00:22:19,346 --> 00:22:21,613
If Debra found out

601
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:23,882
that Ty was with that poor girl...

602
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:33,325
Hmm. Finally, some rain.

603
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:35,527
Maybe someone up there
is looking out for us.

604
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:36,828
I can assure you,

605
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:39,430
He's in no way
meteorologically inclined.

606
00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:40,737
Apart from the whole Noah thing,

607
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:42,967
and that was a one-off.

608
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:48,472
Anyhow, her roommate confirmed

609
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,241
that she took the 4:00 p.m. class, so...

610
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,609
Ty's ex should be out any second now.

611
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:54,644
I told you you had the wrong man.

612
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:56,446
Wrong gender as well, apparently.

613
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:57,714
Finally, we're getting warmer.

614
00:22:57,781 --> 00:23:00,717
Why are you so hell-bent on
proving Ty's not the killer?

615
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:01,784
Like I've been saying,

616
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:03,586
I want to punish the real killer.

617
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:04,955
But why?

618
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:06,456
Is it 'cause you pushed him
towards Ali at the party?

619
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:09,259
Well, I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

620
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,693
And I think you're
starting to agree with me.

621
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:12,594
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, would you?

622
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:13,863
- Bye!
- Bye!

623
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,898
CHLOE: There she is.

624
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:19,001
(women conversing
indistinctly in distance)

625
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:20,369
That was great. I'll call you at lunch.

626
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:22,637
- I'm over here.
- CHLOE: Debra Macall?

627
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:24,039
I'm Detective Decker, LAPD.

628
00:23:24,107 --> 00:23:26,275
We need to ask you a few
questions about Ty Huntley.

629
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:27,776
I've got nothing to say.

630
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:29,404
It's either here or down at the station.

631
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:31,112
- Leave me alone!
- CHLOE: Debra...

632
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,785
(car alarm blaring, horn honking)

633
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:40,955
See?

634
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:42,590
Warmer.

635
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,460
Found this on the undercarriage.

636
00:23:56,515 --> 00:23:57,881
Remote detonator.

637
00:23:57,949 --> 00:24:00,584
Whoever set off this bomb was nearby.

638
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:02,252
Scour the security cameras in the area.

639
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,223
Get facial I.D.'s on anyone
in a hundred-block radius.

640
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,924
LUCIFER: You couldn't live with
yourself for committing murder,

641
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:09,792
so you set your car
to explode, didn't you?

642
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,861
Eh? Wanted to go out
in a blaze of glory.

643
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:12,762
Of course not!

644
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,265
Murder? What are you talking about?

645
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,532
LUCIFER: Oh, come on...

646
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,880
The bomb was triggered remotely.

647
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:20,302
Whoever set it off did it
before you got to the car.

648
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,604
There's a clear line of sight.

649
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:23,272
I don't think the plan was to kill you.

650
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,840
I think they wanted to scare you.

651
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:27,643
So... you know of any reason why
someone would want to do that?

652
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,645
No.

653
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:31,247
Yes, why did you run, Debra?

654
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:32,814
Awfully guilty-looking.

655
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:35,242
I thought you were going to bust me

656
00:24:35,284 --> 00:24:36,644
for violating my restraining order.

657
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,420
I went to Ty's party last night.

658
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:41,556
I-I just... I just looked.

659
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:42,990
From outside, through the window.

660
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:44,058
I couldn't help it, I miss him.

661
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:46,528
Yes, breaking up's so hard, isn't it?

662
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:48,329
You're like two pathetic peas in a pod.

663
00:24:48,397 --> 00:24:50,131
Okay, we are made for each other.

664
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,632
As good as he is at football,

665
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,800
that's how good I am
at being his girlfriend.

666
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,302
You mean ex-girlfriend.

667
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,337
We never stay broken
up. It's just a phase.

668
00:24:57,405 --> 00:25:00,073
And no one looks out for
him the way that I do.

669
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:03,210
And then I saw him
kissing that girl and I...

670
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:04,311
Squeezed the life out of her?

671
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,812
DEBRA: No!

672
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:07,746
Where were you between

673
00:25:07,814 --> 00:25:09,054
1:00 and 3:00 a.m. this morning?

674
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:13,786
The only place that always
makes me feel better.

675
00:25:13,853 --> 00:25:15,854
(sobbing)

676
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:19,425
DAN: How long does this go on?

677
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:20,793
CHLOE: Three hours.

678
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,728
(wry laugh)

679
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:24,356
That's the saddest thing I've ever seen.

680
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,798
CHLOE: Yep. All-night froyo shop

681
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:29,167
puts Debra there well past
the time of the victim's death.

682
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:30,735
Her alibi checks out.

683
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:34,072
So Debra didn't strangle Ali.

684
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:35,873
Well, whoever planted the bomb

685
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:38,210
went to great lengths to
make us think Debra did it.

686
00:25:38,277 --> 00:25:39,744
Why?

687
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:40,812
I don't know.

688
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:48,319
We might actually know
who rigged the car.

689
00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:51,822
Ronnie Hillman.

690
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,092
CHLOE: The big Hollywood fixer?

691
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:56,159
Yeah.

692
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:57,261
A security cam caught her

693
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,969
walking nearby, right
after the explosion.

694
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:00,149
This can't be a coincidence.

695
00:26:00,197 --> 00:26:01,557
Someone must've hired her for this.

696
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:03,866
I've been trying to build
a case on her for years,

697
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,335
and every time we've approached her,

698
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:07,270
she's lawyered up immediately.

699
00:26:07,338 --> 00:26:08,538
Ronnie is a pro.

700
00:26:08,606 --> 00:26:09,805
So how do we approach her?

701
00:26:09,873 --> 00:26:11,107
She's picky about talking to strangers.

702
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:13,743
Definitely no cops.

703
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,514
What about someone

704
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:22,117
she'd never expect us to work with?

705
00:26:22,184 --> 00:26:23,918
LUCIFER: Do I get a code word?

706
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:25,987
You know, for when you take her down.

707
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:27,922
If so, might I suggest

708
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,157
"monkey bottoms"?

709
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:30,505
'Cause trust me, I can work that

710
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,593
into any sentence quite naturally.

711
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:33,561
You sure this is a good idea?

712
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:34,862
Lucifer reached out to her

713
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:36,964
and she agreed to meet
him, so it's our best shot.

714
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,767
And you won't need a code
word, and you won't be miked,

715
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,302
because she'll be looking for that.

716
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,370
This is a simple handoff.

717
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:44,338
All we need you to do is vouch for Dan

718
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:45,673
as someone that needs her services.

719
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:47,475
Vouch for Detective Douche?

720
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:50,443
Oh, gosh, this is gonna
be harder than I thought.

721
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:51,911
Once I engage with her, I will hire her

722
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:52,979
to fix a problem of mine.

723
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Right.

724
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:55,315
Well, if it's that stick up your ass,

725
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:57,350
I'm afraid there's no one
strong enough to pull that out.

726
00:26:57,418 --> 00:26:58,718
She goes there to fix my problem,

727
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,453
our people will be
waiting to arrest her.

728
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:01,655
- Ah.
- CHLOE: And then we'll have leverage

729
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:03,390
to find out what she
knows about Ali's murder.

730
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,024
She has information we need,

731
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,372
so let's just stick to the plan.

732
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,226
Assuming, of course,
Ronnie hasn't run off

733
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,561
because our sting suddenly turned into

734
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,962
a Michael Bublй concert.

735
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:13,599
Lucifer, this isn't a game.

736
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,834
- Oh.
- Now, are you up for this or not?

737
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:19,805
Am I up for encouraging someone
to commit a nefarious act?

738
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,340
Mm, let me think.

739
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:23,275
Put me in, Coach.

740
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,276

Mm, you checking for a wire

760
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,557

Mmm! (chuckles)

764
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:21,863
Hello, Mr. Morningstar.

765
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,332
Rest assured...

766
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,133
I can help you with your problem.

767
00:28:26,201 --> 00:28:28,837
Well, actually, I don't need your help.

768
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:30,372
I...

769
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,473
Wait, what do you think my problem is?

770
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,375
Impostor running around
ruining your name.

771
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:37,778
Your professional reputation
has taken a bit of a dive.

772
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,549
As has your sexual one, I'm afraid.

773
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:44,852
All those unsatisfied ladies...

774
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:46,787
Word gets around.

775
00:28:48,022 --> 00:28:50,790
That is the reason you
reached out to me, isn't it?

776
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:56,228
Yes.

777
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:57,530
Yes, it very much is.

778
00:28:57,598 --> 00:28:59,866
I do have a problem
that could use your help.

779
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:01,133
I am all yours.

780
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:03,503
Oh! Well, I like you,
monkey bottoms. (chuckles)

781
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,537

783
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:09,007

what are you doing?

00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:10,275
(music playing over speakers)

785
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:11,777
Hey, Dan, what's going on?

786
00:29:13,446 --> 00:29:15,013
DAN: I don't know.

787
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,815
They're still talking.

788
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:21,820
And now she's leaving.

789
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:25,823
LUCIFER: Lovely.

790
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,826
What the hell did you do?

791
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:31,962
I hired the fixer to fix
a problem, like you wanted.

792
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,531
You let her go. What
happened to the plan?

793
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:35,666
- I made a better one.
- How?

794
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:36,934
Just sit tight

795
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,436
and we'll all get what we want.

796
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:52,854
- Finally!
- (whimpers)

797
00:29:52,922 --> 00:29:55,490
The would-be Prince of Darkness.

798
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:57,492
Payment due upon delivery.

799
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
(wry laugh)

800
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:01,129
I'd like to examine the goods first.

801
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:02,396
RONNIE: Your dime.

802
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:08,302
Right.

803
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:10,838
Let's see the face of my impostor.

804
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:15,710
(Maze laughs)

805
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:19,245
The resemblance is uncanny.

806
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:25,485
It most certainly is not.

807
00:30:25,552 --> 00:30:26,620
(giggling)

808
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:28,554
How could anyone think that you were me?

809
00:30:28,623 --> 00:30:31,290
(false British accent): You
know who you're messing with?

810
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:33,526
I'm Lucifer freaking Morningstar!

811
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:35,061
Oh...

812
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:36,228
Are you now?

813
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:39,164
Well... you've certainly
been a busy bee,

814
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:41,366
haven't you, "Lucifer"?

815
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:42,604
Eh?

816
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:44,670
Apparently, you've
started a modeling agency,

817
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:47,539
pitched a Web series.

818
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:49,942
And I hear you've also been

819
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,044
very active with the women.

820
00:30:52,112 --> 00:30:53,177
Ladies love me.

821
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:54,679
What can I say?

822
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:57,414
It's what they've been
saying that's the trouble.

823
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,317
It seems you're a bit
of a two-pump chump.

824
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:01,653
Also, a crier afterwards.

825
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,587
That happened one time.

826
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:06,457
Right. Well, we can't
have you running around

827
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:08,192
cheapening the Lucifer
brand, now, can we?

828
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,560
What do you say, Maze?

829
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:12,328
Impalement?

830
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:13,764
MAZE: Hmm...

831
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:16,299
Why rush?

832
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,234
- I say the rack.
- Oh.

833
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:19,836
- Oh!
- Ooh.

834
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:21,237
That way,

835
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:23,040
we can really enjoy it.

836
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:24,975
LUCIFER: Better. Yes, much better.

837
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:27,209
Every joint of every limb

838
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:29,011
dislocated before it's torn off.

839
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:32,081
No, no, no, no, no... look,
look, look, I just... I just...

840
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:34,583
I just wanted to get
chicks and-and free drinks.

841
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:36,418
Um, really.

842
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,321
(dropping accent) My name is Justin.

843
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:40,389
I'm from Sherman Oaks.

844
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,523
(Maze and Lucifer laughing)

845
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:43,692
Oh, Justin...

846
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,459
the things I'm gonna do to you.

847
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:46,961
Oh, no, no, no, I-I'm sorry!

848
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:48,196
I only came here one time

849
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:50,031
and I just told some girls

850
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:51,399
that I owned the place, and...

851
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:53,001
and that opened some doors for me

852
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:54,268
and so I just started rolling with it.

853
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:57,072
How dare you abscond my name!

854
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:58,840
Please, don't hurt me.

855
00:31:58,908 --> 00:32:00,175
Please.

856
00:32:00,242 --> 00:32:01,522
LUCIFER: I'm not gonna hurt you,

857
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:03,844
Justin, I'm going to destroy you.

858
00:32:03,912 --> 00:32:06,146
Oh, this is so hot.

859
00:32:06,214 --> 00:32:09,083
It's like you're punishing yourself.

860
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:17,591
Seems I could be just, um,

861
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:19,258
overreacting a bit.

862
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:25,431
Go.

863
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:26,665
Go on!

864
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:30,203
And never sully my name again.

865
00:32:34,174 --> 00:32:35,841
Let's at least take a finger.

866
00:32:35,908 --> 00:32:37,375
We've done enough, Maze.

867
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:45,951
Pleasure doing business
with you, Lucifer.

868
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:47,385
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

869
00:32:47,453 --> 00:32:49,955
Which is why I'm going to have
to apologize for my friends.

870
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:51,123
What friends?

871
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,389
CHLOE: Ronnie Hillman,

872
00:32:52,457 --> 00:32:54,424
you're under arrest for
kidnapping and assault.

873
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,798
Would you mind calling my lawyer?

874
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:02,986
(handcuffs tightening) Her
number's in my back pocket.

875
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:04,501
Yeah, sure thing.

876
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:06,070
I'll tell her about the kidnapping,

877
00:33:06,138 --> 00:33:07,604
the airtight evidence we have,

878
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:09,572
the attempted murder on Debra Macall,

879
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,760
and then when we connect
you to Ali Thornton's murder,

880
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:13,209
maybe you'll get a
nice injection of drugs,

881
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:15,211
and you can go to sleep forever.

882
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,415
Hang on... I had nothing
to do with Ali's murder.

883
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:23,653
Debra Macall, Ty Huntley's
ex, she's the murderer.

884
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,421
I cared about Ali.

885
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:26,822
Mm-hmm, here's what I think.

886
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,724
I think you tried to scare Debra
into confessing to Ali's murder,

887
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:31,026
but Debra didn't do it.

888
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,795
She's got an ironclad alibi.

889
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:37,732
This is my fault.

890
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,567
Why?

891
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:43,271
I promised Ali I would protect her.

892
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:46,040
All she ever wanted
was to be an actress.

893
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,775
She was gonna leave her mark.

894
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:49,010
But you know how that goes.

895
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:52,379
Endless rejection, she ran out of money.

896
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,349
This was her first gig with me.

897
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,351
She didn't even know if she could do it.

898
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:01,621
But I told her... I told
her it was just like acting.

899
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:04,925
Besides, who doesn't want
to sleep with Ty Huntley?

900
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,627
I thought Ty's agent hired
Ali to sleep with him.

901
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:10,864
He hired me for a number
three special: blackmail.

902
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:14,067
Slip him a roofie, get naked,
whip out a selfie stick,

903
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,335
and voilГ .

904
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:17,102
LUCIFER: Why would he have any desire

905
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,637
to blackmail his own star client,

906
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:20,239
a client he's all about protecting?

907
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:23,209
Ty's agent told you
that Debra killed Ali.

908
00:34:23,276 --> 00:34:26,178
He did, yeah.

909
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:37,255
You think Joe's the killer,

910
00:34:37,323 --> 00:34:40,191
that he took things into his
own hands, quite literally.

911
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:41,392
We don't have any proof.

912
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,029
Right, well, how do you
propose that we get him?

913
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,999
Joe pointed the finger right at Debra,

914
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:49,267
painted her as crazy.

915
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:50,801
It's not that hard a picture
to paint, in her case.

916
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:53,403
Why was he so certain
she'd make a good suspect?

917
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:56,506
Maybe he found out
she went to Ty's party.

918
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:59,109
Maybe he knew she went to Ty's party.

919
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:18,213
You are looking Basat
the future of football.

920
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:20,349
The American Dream.

921
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:24,753
Honest, resilient, heroic.

922
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,022
The police tried to pin

923
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:31,093
the death of that poor girl on you.

924
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:33,928
But we kept it out of the press.

925
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:37,165
We got you out of jail.

926
00:35:37,232 --> 00:35:39,233
We will always protect you...

927
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:42,203
and make you a bigger star than ever.

928
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:45,073
This is Ty Huntley...

929
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,641
rebranded. (laughs)

930
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:54,114
LUCIFER: Rebranded, eh?

931
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:55,848
Does it come with a new scent?

932
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:56,983
Free toy inside?

933
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:58,918
What do you want?

934
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:01,321
Ty is free on bail.

935
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:03,457
We have to talk to Ty
down at the station again,

936
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:05,258
maybe walk him past a few reporters.

937
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:06,825
Whoa, hold on, uh, Joe, what is this?

938
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:08,594
Oh, come on! This is ridiculous.

939
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:10,829
Ty wouldn't hurt anybody!

940
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:12,098
What about Debra?

941
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:13,532
I told you to look into her.

942
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,700
She's the crazy one.

943
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,202
Yes, well, I thought
it was her all along.

944
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:18,471
I mean, the woman certainly
redefines "intensity."

945
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:21,340
But Debra was home with a
friend the night of the murder.

946
00:36:21,408 --> 00:36:22,475
What?!

947
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:23,708
She's lying.

948
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:25,535
There's no evidence
placing her at the party.

949
00:36:25,544 --> 00:36:26,578
No one saw her.

950
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:29,046
So are you ready to face the cameras?

951
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:30,582
His sponsors will love
the free publicity.

952
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:33,585
Tell me, what's ten percent of nothing?

953
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,320
I saw Debra there.

954
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:40,190
I went by the party.

955
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:44,661
But a work call came up,
and I never made it inside.

956
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:46,296
I didn't say anything before

957
00:36:46,364 --> 00:36:49,133
because I told my wife
I was working late.

958
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,270
When I was driving away, I
saw Debra outside Ty's window.

959
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,939
So you admit you were there that night.

960
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:58,641
Yeah, and so was Debra.

961
00:36:58,708 --> 00:36:59,988
That's the proof you need, right?

962
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,250
CHLOE: That's the proof we need.

963
00:37:01,311 --> 00:37:03,746
We have a sworn statement
from Ronnie Hillman

964
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:05,014
saying that you hired the victim

965
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:07,150
to make a sex tape with
Ty to blackmail him.

966
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:08,651
I just needed to place you at the scene.

967
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:10,453
LUCIFER: Yeah, see,
that's why I don't lie.

968
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,522
It's so hard to keep
track of who knows what.

969
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:14,189
It's not true.

970
00:37:14,257 --> 00:37:16,591
I only want what's best for you, Ty.

971
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:17,892
You know, I still don't understand.

972
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,594
Why is it my own agent
would want to blackmail me?

973
00:37:19,662 --> 00:37:22,464
Because he thought eventually
you were gonna leave him.

974
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,633
What, because I took one
meeting with another agency?

975
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:26,801
Joe...

976
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,370
I only did that to make Debra happy.

977
00:37:28,437 --> 00:37:29,837
But even though you'd broken up,

978
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:31,145
he knew you'd get back together,

979
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:33,907
so he decided to strike
first, get some leverage.

980
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:37,211
If he left me, I would be ruined.

981
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:38,945
I mean, do you understand?

982
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:40,381
He is my Brady, my Manning.

983
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:43,083
But Ali wasn't cut out for
this sort of thing, was she?

984
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:44,685
She didn't want to give you the video.

985
00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:46,320
Stupid bitch.

986
00:37:48,122 --> 00:37:50,790
She said she realized Ty was a good guy.

987
00:37:50,857 --> 00:37:52,091
She didn't want to go through with it.

988
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,495
Her name was Ali Thornton,
and you killed her.

989
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:56,696
For what?

990
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:58,831
Greed? Ego?

991
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:00,099
I didn't want to hurt her.

992
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:02,702
I just wanted her phone. And...

993
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:04,637
(Joe sighs)

994
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:11,210
But I squeezed too hard.

995
00:38:12,778 --> 00:38:13,812
I'm done.

996
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:16,114
Forget this. I'm out of here.

997
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:23,120
(gasps)

998
00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:25,022
Did I squeeze too hard?

999
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:28,726
How did you... ?

1000
00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:29,993
What did... ?

1001
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:31,995
Lucifer, what are you doing?

1002
00:38:32,063 --> 00:38:34,332
Finally focusing my
anger where it belongs.

1003
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,433
Lucifer...

1004
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,004
(chuckles)

1005
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:44,608
Yes, of course.

1006
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:46,175
Your turn, Detective.

1007
00:38:46,244 --> 00:38:49,679
(sirens wailing, radio chatter)

1008
00:38:55,353 --> 00:38:57,786
I still can't believe Joe did this.

1009
00:38:57,854 --> 00:39:01,624
I wasn't ever gonna
leave him, you know that?

1010
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:03,158
Definitely gonna leave him now.

1011
00:39:03,226 --> 00:39:04,893
But you know what, you, uh...

1012
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:06,762
you stayed good to your word, Lucifer.

1013
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:07,929
Thank you.

1014
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:11,066
Yes, well, now you owe me one.

1015
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:15,770
DEBRA: Ty!

1016
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:17,538
Ty! Ty!

1017
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:20,341
Oh, my baby.

1018
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:21,942
Oh, my God, I'm so glad to see you.

1019
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,178
- Oh.
- You are?

1020
00:39:24,246 --> 00:39:25,613
Yes, you are crazy, baby.

1021
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:28,048
- But you're my crazy, you hear me?
- Yeah?

1022
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:32,185
Warms the cockles, doesn't it?

1023
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,054
So, Detective,

1024
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,823
looks like you've solved another case

1025
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:37,891
because of me.

1026
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:39,459
I solved this case despite you.

1027
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:41,662
What? What about the cell phone I found?

1028
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:42,929
That was key evidence.

1029
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:44,298
Evidence you almost destroyed.

1030
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:46,866
I got you the leverage
you needed to crack Ronnie.

1031
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:49,302
You co-opted a sting
operation for your own gain.

1032
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,737
And I solved another crime.

1033
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:53,906
Identity theft. (chuckles)

1034
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:56,909
Come on, admit it... we
solved this one together.

1035
00:39:56,976 --> 00:39:59,712
<i>Or are you too egotistical
to acknowledge my help?</i>

1036
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:04,149
Okay, yeah, you didn't
completely destroy the case.

1037
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:06,618
So you can stop blaming yourself, great.

1038
00:40:06,686 --> 00:40:08,119
Whatever do you mean?

1039
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:12,089
The whole reason you tried
to prove Ty's innocence?

1040
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:14,292
Was to catch the true culprit.

1041
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:17,762
Yeah, sure.

1042
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:23,967
LUCIFER: So I decided
not to punish myself.

1043
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:25,703
Yourself?

1044
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,938
Well, my fake self.

1045
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:29,239
The person I'd kidnapped.

1046
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:31,508
I decided not to beat him up.

1047
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:34,010
(sighs) You were right, I was, um...

1048
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:35,779
- (sighs loudly with satisfaction)
- What's the word?

1049
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:37,314
Displacing?

1050
00:40:37,382 --> 00:40:40,316
Displacing my anger and
frustration on Luci-phony,

1051
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:43,353
because the right person wasn't
being punished for Ali's death.

1052
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,355
And who was the right person?

1053
00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:48,090
Well, the sleazy agent, of course.

1054
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:50,360
Ah, yeah.

1055
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:53,596
Of all the cities in the world, Lucifer,

1056
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:56,264
why did you decide to
come to Los Angeles?

1057
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:58,266
Well, the same reason as everyone else.

1058
00:40:58,334 --> 00:41:00,068
Uh, the weather, porn stars,

1059
00:41:00,135 --> 00:41:01,903
Mexican food... mm!

1060
00:41:01,971 --> 00:41:03,304
Mmm.

1061
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:05,373
You know, you say... you
say people are phony here,

1062
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:09,310
but I think people come
here to reinvent themselves.

1063
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,312
And I think that's why you're here.

1064
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:13,313
To reinvent yourself.

1065
00:41:13,382 --> 00:41:16,149
Why would I mess with perfection?

1066
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:20,287
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

1067
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:24,592
I told you, I'm good
at punishing people...

1068
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:27,395
nay, I'm the best at
punishing bad people.

1069
00:41:27,462 --> 00:41:29,863
I didn't enjoy it when
my father forced me to,

1070
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,865
but now that it's on my own terms,

1071
00:41:31,932 --> 00:41:33,666
it's downright delightful.

1072
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,869
Yeah, well, I think you don't just enjoy

1073
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:37,670
punishing the bad guys.

1074
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:39,873
I think you're starting
to like seeking justice

1075
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,141
for the good ones.

1076
00:41:45,312 --> 00:41:46,412
Like Ali.

1077
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:47,646
(Lucifer scoffs)

1078
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:51,149
It's another reason to hate L.A...

1079
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,885
all this self indulgent therapy.

1080
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:54,052
You should be ashamed.

1081
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,521
You're doing it again.

1082
00:41:55,588 --> 00:41:56,622
What?

1083
00:41:56,689 --> 00:41:58,356
Displacing.

1084
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:00,158
No, I'm not.

1085
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,760
And that's denial.

1086
00:42:01,828 --> 00:42:03,961
That's a river in Africa.

1087
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:05,963
