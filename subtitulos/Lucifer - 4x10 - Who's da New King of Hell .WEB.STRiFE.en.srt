<i>No.</i>

328
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,036
<i>But whatever demon's taken over</i>
<i>his body better be worried.</i>

329
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,790
<i>Lucifer's going to be pissed.</i>
<i>He banned possession years ago.</i>

330
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,293
<i>Well, something's clearly changed.</i>

331
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,213
<i>So there I am, hanging in hell...</i>

332
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,675
<i>popping out eyeballs</i>
<i>like any other Tuesday,</i>

333
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,759
<i>and this priest...</i>

334
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,428
<i>he just shows up on my docket.</i>

335
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,431
<i>Is this one of those "priest </i>
<i>walks into a bar" jokes? I love them.</i>

336
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,850
<i>Dude was boring.</i>

337
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,854
<i>I mean, all he kept saying was, </i>
<i>"Prophecy this, prophecy that.</i>

338
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,233
<i>I've got a stupid accent. </i>
<i>Makes me sound like a pirate. Argh!"</i>

00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,150
<i>[laughs]</i>

340
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,446
<i>Anyway, he says that he needs help</i>
<i>getting you back to hell, so...</i>

341
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,073
<i>of course...</i>

342
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,367
<i>Dromos, ever loyal...</i>

343
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,035
<i>I did not hesitate.</i>

344
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,579
<i>I came straight here to answer your call.</i>

345
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,540
<i>[Lucifer laughs]</i>

346
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,624
<i>Of course.</i>

347
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,460
<i>This is Kinley's hail Mary.</i>

348
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:48,424
<i>His final attempt to subvert the prophecy </i>
<i>by tricking me into returning.</i>

349
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,843
<i>[laughing] Voluntarily!</i>

350
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,388
<i>Well, it's an admirable plan, </i>
<i>but he needn't have bothered.</i>

351
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,473
<i>I've just beaten the prophecy on my own.</i>

352
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,142
<i>Besides...</i>

353
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,936
<i>no way in hell I'd ever return to...</i>

354
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,105
<i>well, you know...</i>

00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,732
<i>Lucifer.</i>

356

<i>You've been on vacation forever.</i>

357
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,904
<i>You didn't write, you didn't call.</i>

358
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,533
<i>You didn't even send a burnt offering.</i>
<i>The demons of Hell...</i>

359
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,161
<i>they need a king.</i>

360
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,079
<i>Very well.</i>

00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,874
<i>Dromos of the Lilim,</i>

362

<i>by the power of Grayskull,</i>
<i>blah-di-blah-di-blah,</i>

363
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,504
<i>I hereby name you King of Hell.</i>

364
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,131
<i>There you go. Throne's all yours.</i>

365
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,551
<i>[short laugh]</i>
<i>Yeah, that's really funny.</i>

366
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,137
<i>But we all know that the king...</i>

367
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,139
<i>he needs to be an angel.</i>

368
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,476
<i>Fair point, yeah.</i>

369
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,477
<i>Lucifer.</i>

370
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,564
<i>Hell has been really bad since you left.</i>

371
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,777
<i>Oh, that's a shame, because it was</i>
<i>a real vacation destination before.</i>

372
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,696
<i>What's so great about Earth, anyway?</i>

373
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,532
<i>Well, no offense, </i>
<i>but the company's far greater,</i>

374

<i>the work more interesting</i>
<i>and the liquor far superior.</i>

375
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,120
<i>Mm!</i>

376
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,208
<i>And I've just become an uncle and someone </i>
<i>needs to teach my nephew about sex,</i>

377
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,585
<i>because...</i>
<i>my brother's certainly not capable.</i>

378
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,420
<i>So.</i>

379
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,756
<i>Back to hell you go, it seems.</i>

<i>Those eyeballs won't pop themselves out.</i>

00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,930
<i>Alright.</i>

382
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,390
<i>I think we might stay for a little bit.</i>

383
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,559

388
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,948
<i>No more possession.</i>

389
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,035
<i>Time for all good demons...</i>

<i>to go home.</i>

391
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,580
<i>Now.</i>

00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,544

<i>Arias of the humpback whale.</i>

00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,191
<i>Isn't it amazing?</i>

398
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,111
<i>And perfect for a nice, relaxing bath,</i>

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,288
<i>Okay.</i>

403
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,335
<i>Linda, you'll have to put him down</i>

<i>I suppose you're right.</i>

405
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,173
<i>I could use a nap.</i>

406
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,719
<i>Or maybe I should feed him again.</i>

407
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,097
<i>Or get him another blanket.</i>

408
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,682
<i>Or take this blanket off.</i>

<i>Oh, is that all?</i>

435
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,944
<i>Well, I already know. I saw them earlier.</i>

436
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,364
<i>It seems Kinley summoned them </i>
<i>to take me back to Hell.</i>

<i>I sent them packing.</i>

<i>in the hellfire chandelier.</i>

<i>I'm going to call Chloe.</i>

<i>-Amenadiel probably did.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

<i>Yeah, I'm sure Amenadiel</i>
<i>canceled the nurse,</i>

<i>And then Charlie...</i>

00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,443
<i>-Yeah, right.</i>
<i>-Um...</i>

495
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,236
<i>Linda...</i>

496
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,573
<i>there's something </i>
<i>I think I need to tell you.</i>

497
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:14,536
<i>The good news is I think you're right,</i>
<i>I think Amenadiel has the child safe.</i>

498
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,956
<i>The bad news is </i>
<i>I think it's my least favorite place.</i>

499
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,666
<i>Heaven.</i>

500
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,256
<i>Are you trying to tell me </i>
<i>that Charlie is...</i>

501
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,884
<i>Oh, no! No, no. Of course not.</i>

502
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,260
<i>That baby is half-angel.</i>

503
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,096
<i>He can come and go from heaven freely. </i>
<i>He just needs...</i>

504
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,514
<i>someone to bring him.</i>

505
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,187
<i>So Amenadiel took our baby from me?</i>

506
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,648
<i>To live in heaven?</i>

507
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,900
<i>I'll kill him.</i>

508
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,776
<i>I am so sorry, Linda.</i>

509
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,279
<i>I should have gleaned</i>
<i>Amenadiel's intentions earlier.</i>

510
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,739
<i>He tried to tell me in the hospital</i>

511
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:54,409
<i>and I thought we were talking</i>
<i>about turtle necks versus crew necks.</i>

512
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,036
<i>[laughs]</i>
<i>But if it's any consolation,</i>

513
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,456
<i>I do think Amenadiel </i>
<i>is simply trying to keep Charlie safe.</i>

514
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,041
<i>[door rattles]</i>

515
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,085
<i>Hey.</i>

516
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,297
<i>[yells] How could you? [thump]</i>

517
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,216
<i>You go back and get him!</i>

518
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,467
<i>You go back!</i>

519
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,470
<i>-What? I never took Charlie--</i>
<i>-You heard. Right now!</i>

520
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,387
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

521
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,849
<i>-Wait a minute. He's not here?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

522
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,977
<i>-Because you took him up there.</i>
<i>-No, Linda, I swear I didn't.</i>

523
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,898
<i>Look, I was going to,</i>

524
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,982
<i>but then I...</i>

525
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,067
<i>I couldn't.</i>

526
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,736
<i>What you said to me </i>
<i>right before you went to sleep, I...</i>

527
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,491
<i>I was just so confused,</i>
<i>and I just needed to clear my head, so...</i>

528
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,202
<i>I decided to go for a long walk.</i>

529
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,287
<i>But I handed Charlie to the night nurse.</i>

530
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,957
<i>The nurse never came to the house,</i>
<i>Amenadiel.</i>

531
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,625
<i>[Amenadiel] What?</i>

532
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,963
<i>Yes. Yes, she was. She was rocking</i>
<i>Charlie to sleep when I left.</i>

533
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,884
<i>Is that the woman</i>
<i>you handed Charlie off to?</i>

534
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:55,887
<i>No.</i>

535
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,764
<i>No, that's not her.</i>

536
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,649
<i>[Dan] Hey, Chloe.</i>
<i>We tracked the call to the agency.</i>

537
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,777
<i>-The one canceling the nurse.</i>
<i>-Phone is registered to a Lyla Claybourne.</i>

538
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,445
<i>SWAT is on their way to her apartment.</i>

539
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,363
<i>[Chloe] </i><span style="style2">Okay.</i>

540
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,739
<i>Will you send a photo of Lyla?</i>

541
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,742
<i>I want to confirm with Amenadiel</i>
<i>it's the same person that took the baby.</i>

542
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,660
<i>Of course.</i>

543
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,787
<i>Hey, Chloe, </i>
<i>could you tell Linda and Amenadiel </i>

544
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,124
<i>that everyone here is praying for them--</i>
<i>pulling for them. Okay?</i>

545
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,251
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

546
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,799
<i>Ella, are you okay?</i>

547
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,387
<i>Hey... I hope you know</i>
<i>that I'm here for you.</i>

548
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,638
<i>You're not alone.</i>

549
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,475
<i>See, that's just it. </i>
<i>I never used to feel alone.</i>

550
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,895
<i>Because I always had the big guy.</i>

551
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,690
<i>I really miss him.</i>

552
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,192
<i>I was just so mad.</i>

553
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,029
<i>So mad after...</i>

554
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,197
<i>you know, Charlotte.</i>

555
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,491
<i>I've been mad too.</i>

556
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,286
<i>Really mad.</i>

557
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,413
<i>It's just so much.</i>

558
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,124
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-But I don't think it's right for me</i>

559
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,585
<i>to base my faith </i>
<i>on whether everything is...</i>

560
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,088
<i>good and unicorns and ice cream.</i>

561
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,259
<i>I don't think it's God's job</i>
<i>to stop the bad.</i>

562
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,929
<i>I actually think...</i>

563
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,850
<i>he's there to give us the strength</i>
<i>to get through it.</i>

564
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,893
<i>[sniffs]</i>

565
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,105
<i>[kiss]</i>

<i>[phone buzzes]</i>

567
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,363
<i>Amenadiel...</i>

568
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,741
<i>That's her.</i>

569
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,830
<i>That's Lyla? That's who's got Charlie?</i>

570
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,416
<i>Detective, I saw her last night in Lux.</i>

571
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,544
<i>I think I know who has the baby.</i>

572
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,967
<i>-[baby cries]</i>
<i>-Shh.</i>

573
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,013
<i>You're such a little cutie.</i>

574
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,016
<i>-I'm going to teach you so much.</i>
<i>-[bash]</i>

575
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,184
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

576
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,936
<i>-Everything I know.</i>
<i>-[thud]</i>

577
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,145
<i>Shh.</i>

578
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,190
<i>[baby cries]</i>

579
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,192
<i>That's right, my little angel.</i>

580
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,780
<i>-[baby cries]</i>
<i>-Who's da new king of Hell?</i>

581
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,240
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

582
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,867
<i>-That's right.</i>
<i>-[knife scrapes]</i>

583
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,577
<i>Can you say...</i>

584
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,871
<i>"Lucifer who?"</i>

585
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,540
<i>[baby cries]</i>

586
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,251
<i>Lucifer who? Shh.</i>

587
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,215
<i>[Dan]</i>
<i>SWAT just cleared Lyla's apartment.</i>

588
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,216
<i>What about Lyla?</i>

589
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,469
<i>She's not there either. But there is</i>
<i>a big pool of blood in the bedroom.</i>

590
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,389
<i>Another blood pool without a body.</i>

591
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:48,268
<i>I still can't find any connection between</i>
<i>Kinley, Holla Bae or Lyla Claybourne.</i>

592
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,061
<i>Maybe Kinley brainwashed the other two,</i>

593
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,688
<i>like he did that Los Xs guy, remember?</i>

594
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,984
<i>That's a really weird, weird choice</i>
<i>in new minions, but yeah, maybe.</i>

595
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,570
<i>And maybe we'll get a hit </i>
<i>on the APB we put out.</i>

596
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,030
<i>[Lucifer] Detective... a word.</i>

597
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,782
<i>[Chloe] Excuse me.</i>

598
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,325
<i>[clears throat]</i>

599
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,040
<i>Detective, another blood pool with no body</i>
<i>means another demon.</i>

600
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,169
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Should we just tell Dan and Ella the truth</i>

601
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,671
<i>about who or what these cadavers</i>
<i>really are?</i>

602
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,175
<i>I mean, the more teammates playing</i>
<i>the real game, the better, right?</i>

603
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,178
<i>No. They'll never believe us. [chuckles]</i>

604
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,305
<i>I mean, not unless I show them,</i>

605
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:29,434
<i>and you certainly know how long it takes</i>
<i>to recover, or not recover, from that.</i>

606
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:34,272
<i>Yes. Back at the penthouse,</i>
<i>I was trying to tell you that I'm not--</i>

607
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,857
<i>Detective,</i>
<i>I can't believe I'm saying this,</i>

608
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,942
<i>but there are more important things </i>
<i>than me right now.</i>

609
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,527
<i>Okay.</i>

610
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,987
<i>Then we need to figure out</i>

611
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,240
<i>why demon Kinley and his crew</i>
<i>would take Charlie.</i>

612
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,077
<i>Well, it's clearly all about me.</i>
<i>I ordered them to go home,</i>

613
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,622
<i>they got angry, and they're doing this</i>
<i>to get back at me.</i>

614
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,832
<i>How do we find three demons and a baby?</i>

615
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,419
<i>Uh... three demons and a baby?</i>
<i>That's one of my favorite movies.</i>

616
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,547
<i>-Not as good as the original though.</i>
<i>-[laughing] So true, so true.</i>

617
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,343
<i>Why don't we go back to my penthouse</i>
<i>where we can strategize freely?</i>

618
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,260
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

619
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,637
<i>Yeah.</i>

620
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,103
<i>[Eve] Dromos, what are you doing here?</i>

621
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,148
<i>Did you find Lucifer?</i>

622
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,652
<i>Have you convinced him</i>
<i>to go back to Hell?</i>

623
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,987
<i>How did you find me?</i>

624
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,948
<i>I used a Find My Phone app.</i>

625
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,200
<i>Because you still have my phone.</i>

626
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,620
<i>Remember? The one I gave you</i>
<i>to give me updates on.</i>

627
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,580
<i>The one you are not answering.</i>

628
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,959
<i>Ah. Yeah, it makes sense. Want some wine?</i>

629
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,418
<i>No!</i>

630
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,878
<i>I don't want wine.</i>

631
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,172
<i>I want to know what you've been up to.</i>

632
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,676
<i>-Have you even spoken to Lucifer yet?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

633
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,553
<i>Well, didn't go so well.</i>

634
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,976
<i>Well, yeah, he can be stubborn.</i>

635
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,230
<i>-Maybe we can talk to him together.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

636
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,815
<i>Change of plans.</i>

637
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,025
<i>Dromos...</i>

638
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,486
<i>I think we've got enough.</i>

639
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,282
<i>-We're ready for The Mayan.</i>
<i>-Who are you?</i>

640

<i>[baby crying]</i>

641
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,499
<i>Dromos, this stupid thing won't shut up.</i>

642
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,459
<i>Can I cut its tongue out?</i>

643
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,545
<i>No. You may not.</i>

644
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,588
<i>What's going on?</i>

645
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,214
<i>[Dromos] Like I said.</i>

646
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:24,924
<i>change of plans.</i>

647
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,761
<i>Look, I summoned you here to get Lucifer,</i>

648
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,640
<i>not terrorize some poor, innocent child.</i>

649
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,683
<i>You listen to me.</i>

650
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,435
<i>I...</i>

651
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,604
<i>I command you--</i>

652
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,314
<i>[yells] Stop talking!</i>

653
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,192
<i>[baby crying]</i>

<i>[Eve gasps]</i>

<i>I don't take orders from you.</i>

656

<i>You are not our king.</i>

657
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,835
<i>Speaking of,</i>
<i>we don't need Lucifer anymore.</i>

658
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,255
<i>Or you, for that matter.</i>

659
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,342
<i>[swish]</i>

660
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,093
<i>[thud]</i>

661
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,351
<i>No news from my brother or Maze.</i>
<i>Perhaps I should get them here as well.</i>

662
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,146
<i>-[whispers] Lucifer!</i>
<i>-[sighs]</i>

663
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,398
<i>[Lucifer] They did this.</i>

664
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:26,444
<i>Vile demons, trying to get back at me</i>
<i>with aimless destruction.</i>

665
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,737
<i>This wasn't aimless.</i>

666
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,948
<i>They were searching for something.</i>

667
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,992
<i>Detective, my safe's open.</i>

668
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,662
<i>What? Is anything missing?</i>

669
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,205
<i>It doesn't appear so.</i>

670
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,082
<i>Cash is all here.</i>

671
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,459
<i>Oh, no.</i>

672
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,170
<i>The vial's gone.</i>

673
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,965
<i>Kinley's vial?</i>

674
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,257
<i>You kept that?</i>

675
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,094
<i>I didn't think it was something</i>
<i>I could just toss down the drain.</i>

676
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,056
<i>I was going to chuck it out</i>
<i>with our spent batteries.</i>

677
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,350
<i>What would they want with the vial?</i>

678
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,354
<i>They're not trying to get back at me.</i>

679
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,314
<i>They're trying to replace me.</i>

680
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,151
<i>How could they possibly do that?</i>

681
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,114
<i>Hell was built so that no demon</i>
<i>could take control of the throne.</i>

682
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,323
<i>Only a celestial could rule.</i>

683
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,033
<i>An angel. But...</i>

684
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,494
<i>I suppose half an angel would do.</i>

685
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,246
<i>Baby Charlie.</i>

686
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,707
<i>Since I refused to return,</i>

687
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,251
<i>it seems they're intent on raising</i>
<i>their own king.</i>

688
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,754
<i>Luce, thank God you're here. </i>
<i>Something awful's--</i>

689
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,173
<i>Not now, Eve!</i>
<i>We are dealing with our own situation.</i>

690
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,633
<i>It's about Kinley.</i>

691
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,346
<i>Or at least the body</i>
<i>formerly known as Kinley anyway.</i>

692
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,015
<i>What do you know about that?</i>

693
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,393
<i>I was the one who broke him out of jail.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

694
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,312
<i>And then he attacked me, so...</i>

695
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,773
<i>I, well...</i>

696
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,942
<i>I killed him.</i>

697
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,114
<i>And then I kind of, sort of...</i>

698
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,701
<i>summoned a demon from Hell</i>
<i>into his body.</i>

699
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,328
<i>What?</i>

700
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,664
<i>It seemed like a good idea at the time.</i>

701
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,169
<i>I thought maybe he could convince you</i>
<i>that the prophecy was nonsense.</i>

702
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,797
<i>But he wouldn't budge</i>
<i>and then he gave me this idea</i>

703
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,800
<i>that maybe if I could get you out of here,</i>
<i>back to Hell,</i>

704
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,719
<i>that everything would be good again.</i>

705
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,513
<i>I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.</i>

706
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,476
<i>-Especially not that poor little baby.</i>
<i>-That's my nephew, Eve.</i>

707
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,269
<i>Eve, how could you do this?</i>

708
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,856
<i>How could you be so selfish? Naive?</i>

709
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,608
<i>Where's the baby now, Eve?</i>

710
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,110
<i>[gasping] I don't know.</i>

711
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:35,239
<i>I don't know. They were in a church</i>
<i>and they knocked me out,</i>

712
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,992
<i>and by the time I came to, they were gone.</i>

713
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,790
<i>[Chloe] Okay.</i>

714
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,666
<i>Alright, if they took the vial,</i>

715
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,795
<i>they're probably planning</i>
<i>on performing the same ceremony...</i>

716
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,172
<i>-that Kinley was going to perform on--</i>
<i>-On me?</i>

717
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,382
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-So come on, tell us, detective,</i>

718
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,010
<i>once you'd served up</i>
<i>this holy, anointed sedative,</i>

719
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,597
<i>where was this ceremony to take place,</i>
<i>back when you wanted me in Hell?</i>

720
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,974
<i>Well, as you know,</i>

721
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,893
<i>I didn't go through with it.</i>

722
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,646
<i>I know he mentioned a church.</i>

723
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,441
<i>Great. There's what,</i>
<i>only 2, 3,000 of those in LA?</i>

724
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,572
<i>He said specifically that it had to be</i>
<i>a house of worship,</i>

725
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,282
<i>but also a den of sin.</i>

726
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,745
<i>One of the demons mentioned something</i>
<i>about one of those old civilizations.</i>

727
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,916
<i>Aztec? Or Inca?</i>

728
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,628
<i>Do you think they could be going</i>
<i>to one of those ancient temples</i>

729
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,922
<i>where they used to have human sacrifices?</i>

730
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,423
<i>-Love him.</i>
<span style="style1">-Listen.</i>

731
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,466
<i>I used to hate him.</i>

732
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,511
<i>But we're going to make an announcement</i>
<i>about my tour kicking off</i>

733
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,887
<i>tomorrow night at The Mayan.</i>

734
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,139
<i>The Mayan, that's it!</i>

735
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,392
<i>Okay, it's a venue.</i>
<i>Rents to concerts and also...</i>

736
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,852
<i>I think, church groups.</i>

737
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,645
<i>Sex, drugs, rock and roll and my dad.</i>

738
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,856
<i>That sounds like the oxymoronic venue</i>
<i>we're after.</i>

739
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,649
<i>It's going to be empty and available,</i>

740
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,277
<i>especially since Holla isn't playing there</i>
<i>tonight.</i>

741
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,446
<i>You stay here.</i>

742
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:58,948
<i>You've done enough.</i>

743
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,616
<i>But...</i>

744
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,368
<i>[doors thud]</i>

745
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,133
<i>[baby cries]</i>

746
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,887
<i>If I wanted to hear screaming,</i>
<i>I would have stayed home.</i>

747
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,472
<i>He's just a hungry boy.</i>

748
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,228
<i>[Dromos] Idiot.</i>

749
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,189
<i>It's way too hot.</i>

750
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:35,735
<i>We don't want to burn</i>
<i>our itty-bitty new king.</i>

751
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,695
<i>Just let it cool.</i>

752
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,283
<i>He's just not used to the heat.</i>

753
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,994
<i>Yet.</i>

754
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,621
<i>[baby cries]</i>

755
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,539
<i>Yeah.</i>

756
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,001
<i>Shh.</i>

757
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,466
<i>[Chloe] Anything I need to know</i>
<i>about how to fight a demon?</i>

758
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,719
<i>[Lucifer] Not really. Just that they're</i>
<i>super strong, scary and mean.</i>

759
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,762
<i>Like Maze.</i>

760
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,806
<i>Except these don't feel pain,</i>
<i>because they're only renting their bodies.</i>

761
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,058
<i>-Right.</i>
<i>-Good news is...</i>

762
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,769
<i>they're killable.</i>
<i>Just requires a little extra oomph.</i>

763
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,813
<i>But you don't worry about that</i>
<i>since you're not going inside.</i>

764
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,190
<i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

765
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,902
<i>Demons or no demons,</i>
<i>there's no way I'm not helping.</i>

766
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,572
<i>Need I remind you, detective,</i>
<i>it is less helpful if you're there.</i>

767
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,449
<i>You make me vulnerable, remember?</i>

768
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,701
<i>[Eve] But I don't.</i>

769
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,370
<i>Eve.</i>

770
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,206
<i>-You're supposed to be at the penthouse.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

771
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,627
<i>But I needed to apologize...</i>
<i>for all of it.</i>

772
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,130
<i>And everything I've put you through.</i>
<i>[sniffs]</i>

773
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:45,179
<i>But I realized you're not this perfect guy</i>
<i>I've made you out to be.</i>

774
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,722
<i>You suck at apologies.</i>

775
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,308
<i>What I mean is...</i>

776
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,272
<i>I thought I wanted you,</i>

777
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,565
<i>but I realized I've...</i>

778
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,945
<i>just been missing the person I used to be</i>
<i>when I was with you.</i>

779
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:06,534
<i>I hope you find what you want, Eve,</i>
<i>but I really wish you'd had this epiphany</i>

780
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,953
<i>before you let demons loose</i>
<i>on Los Angeles.</i>

781
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,830
<i>[Eve] You and me both.</i>

782
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,456
<i>Look, I understand that...</i>

783
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,085
<i>there's nothing I can do</i>
<i>to make up for what I've done.</i>

784
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,171
<i>But I'm going to have to try, so...</i>

785
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,800
<i>that's why there's nothing you can do</i>
<i>to stop me from going in there.</i>

786
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,721
<i>Very well.</i>

787
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,391
<i>We'll just have to wait</i>
<i>for my brother and Maze to arrive.</i>

788
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,854
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

789
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,898
<i>Yes, Lucifer told us what you did.</i>

790
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,900
<i>Put your claws away.</i>
<i>There's no time for that.</i>

791
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,611
<i>We need all the help we can get.</i>

792
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,667
<i>[Dromos] Mm.</i>

793
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,841
<i>Ha! Just right.</i>

794
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,696
<i>Dromos!</i>

795
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,992
<i>Surely you've heard breast is best.</i>

796
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,746
<i>[Dromos laughs]</i>

797
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,123
<i>Now, you see...</i>

798
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,625
<i>the thing is...</i>

799
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,003
<i>I don't take orders from you anymore.</i>

800
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,549
<i>Not since the whole abdication thing.</i>

801
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:46,967
<i>So...</i>

802
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,387
<i>long live King Charlie.</i>

803
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,015
<i>He's going to be a hell of a ruler.</i>

804
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,226
<i>Pun intended.</i>

805
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,816
<i>Because I am going to mold him</i>
<i>into exactly what I want.</i>

806
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,653
<i>You know, you've got to admit</i>
<i>you've been a bit of a selfish king.</i>

807
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,572
<i>Keeping the whole Earth thing to yourself.</i>

808
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,157
<i>[yells] Give me my son!</i>

809
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,659
<i>Over my dead body.</i>

810
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:16,080
<i>Oh, that's right. It's already dead, so...</i>

811
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,624
<i>you're going to have to get creative.</i>

812
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,172
<i>[thud]</i>

813
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,635
<i>[thud]</i>

814
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,263
<i>[sound of blades]</i>

815
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,897
<i>[Dromos] Come, my king.</i>

816
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,371
<i>[Dromos] Ah! I wouldn't come any closer </i>
<i>if I were you.</i>

817
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,748
<i>[sound of fighting]</i>

818
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,169
<i>You are going to pay, Dromos.</i>

819
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,087
<i>Really?</i>

820
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,338
<i>My money's on me, pal.</i>

821
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,798
<i>[grunting]</i>

822
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,677
