00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,309
<i>We know about Lucifer Morningstar,</i>
<i>Ms. Decker.</i>

30
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,604
<i>We'd have been aware of him </i>
<i>for about seven years.</i>

31
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,107
<i>At first, we thought he was just</i>
<i>a benign eccentric,</i>

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,983
<i>but the more we watched him, the more...</i>

33
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,152
<i>terrifyingly authentic he became.</i>

34
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,448
<i>And since you've traveled all this way</i>
<i>to research him...</i>

35
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,201
<i>I assume that you agree.</i>

36
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>I don't know what to think.</i>

<i>[Kinley] I realize that this must be</i>

<i>Oh, my backyard chicken.</i>
<i>Well, bathtub chicken.</i>

54

<i>We live in an apartment.</i>

55
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,050
<i>-You have a chicken in your bathroom?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

56
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,387
<i>You know, I'm just trying to explore</i>
<i>new hobbies these days,</i>

57
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,681
<i>now that I've got Sundays free.</i>

58
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:02,891
<i>Right.</i>

59
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,393
<i>You okay there?</i>

60
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,519
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

61
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,478
<i>I mean, sort of.</i>

62
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,523
<i>There's... something I need to do</i>
<i>that I've been putting off.</i>

63
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,942
<i>Oh! Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Whenever I'm procrastinating on something,</i>

64
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,446
<i>I make an appointment for myself to do it.</i>
<i>That way, can't back out.</i>

65
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,325
<i>Like, for example, when I had to ask</i>
<i>my landlord permission to get Bob,</i>

66
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,368
<i>literally put it on my calendar.</i>

67
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,954
<i>Wasn't the, uh--</i>
<i>The chicken is named Margaret?</i>

68
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:25,955
<i>Bob was my turtle.</i>

69
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,956
<i>What happened to Bob?</i>

70
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,917
<i>Didn't get along with Margaret.</i>

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,084
<i>[phone chimes]</i>

72
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,421

<i>-This should be exciting.</i>
<i>-Hmm.</i>

<i>Oh, my gosh. Are you serious?</i>

75
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,929

<i>[Lucifer] Brother.</i>

78
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,031
<i>What are you still doing here? I thought</i>
<i>you'd be frolicking on a cloud by now.</i>

79
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,451
<i>Turns out I'm not moving back</i>
<i>to the Silver City after all.</i>

80
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,411
<i>Really? Why's that?</i>

81
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,997
<i>Well, Lucy, I've decided that my life...</i>

82
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,085
<i>My life is here now, on Earth.</i>

83
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,839
<i>You see, I've come to learn</i>
<i>so much about humans and--</i>

84
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,092
<i>Actually, you know what, never mind.</i>
<i>I'm sorry I asked.</i>

85
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,302
<i>But since you're here,</i>
<i>you can help me decide.</i>

86
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,222
<i>Moscow Midnight or Blue Lagoon?</i>

87
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,223
<i>That's the same shirt.</i>

88
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,060
<i>-Are you sure?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

89
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,520
<i>Thank you.</i>

90
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,605
<i>All right, Lucifer, what's wrong?</i>

91
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,358
<i>Because you never question your own taste.</i>

92
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,819
<i>Well, can't a devil just look nice?</i>

93
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,070
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

94
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,698
<i>I thought things were okay</i>
<i>between you and Chloe.</i>

95
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,242
<i>They are.</i>

96
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,410
<i>They are, yeah.</i>

97
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,161
<i>We're back to being partners.</i>

98
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,788
<i>Fully-clothed partners.</i>

99
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,456
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-Nothing.</i>

100
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,000
<i>Just bully for partners.</i>

101
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,960
<i>Why do I sense a "but" in there somewhere?</i>

102
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:54,961
<i>It's just...</i>

103
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,505
<i>right before Charlotte was killed...</i>

104
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,091
<i>the Detective and I, we shared a...</i>

105
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,720
<i>a moment.</i>

106
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,222
<i>You kissed her.</i>

107
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,642
<i>I did.</i>

108
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,727
<i>Ha!</i>

109
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,604
<i>It's just a kiss. I'm hardly a schoolgirl.</i>

110
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,983
<i>Anyway, I'm just not sure whether</i>
<i>the Detective wants to ignore that...</i>

111
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,986
<i>moment that we had now, or what.</i>

112
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,696
<i>All right.</i>

113
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,073
<i>Listen to me, Lucy.</i>

114
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,118
<i>You need to get out there</i>
<i>and take a chance.</i>

115
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,494
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

116
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,123
<i>Humans, Chloe, people are amazing.</i>

117
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,251
<i>Look, I wasted so much time</i>
<i>keeping them at bay,</i>

118
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:40,965
<i>looking down on them for millennia,</i>
<i>when they have so much to offer.</i>

119
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,511
<i>I'm only now just realizing</i>
<i>how lucky we are...</i>

120
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,723
<i>that we actually get a chance</i>
<i>to connect with them, so...</i>

121
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,018
<i>I say put up your sign...</i>

122
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,312
<i>"Open for business.</i>

123
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,731
<i>Humanity, come on in."</i>

124
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,568
<i>And what does that have to do</i>
<i>with the Detective?</i>

125
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,028
<i>It means ask her out.</i>

126
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,615
<i>On a date.</i>

127
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,415
<i>Mm! That a new fragrance you're wearing?</i>
<i>It's lovely.</i>

128
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,626
<i>It's mosquito repellent.</i>

129
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,795
<i>Oh. Right, yes, of course.</i>

130
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,464
<i>Yes, pesky little buggers, mosquitoes.</i>

131
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,800
<i>They do, however, like to eat.</i>

132
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,302
<i>As do I. Not blood, of course, but food.</i>

133
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,598
<i>-And I know you like to eat food too, so--</i>
<i>-Oh, my gosh, you guys.</i>

134
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:35,228
<i>Can you believe that we are</i>
<i>on the actual set of </i><span style="style1">The Cabin?</i>

135
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,314
<i>Well, I'm not really a reality show</i>
<i>kind of person, Miss Lopez.</i>

136
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,149
<i>I like to enjoy real-life situations.</i>

137
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,652
<i>You know, go out with other people,</i>
<i>for example.</i>

138
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,987
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>I'm usually not into reality shows either.</i>

139
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,741
<i>I prefer more, you know,</i>
<i>scripted-content, documentaries,</i><span style="style1"> </i><i>but... </i>

140
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,619
<i>I've got a little extra time</i>
<i>these days, so...</i>

141
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,956
<i>sort of kind of watched, uh, 27 seasons</i>
<i>in two weeks.</i>

142
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,915
<i>Fascinating.</i>

143
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,792
<i>-Ella, was she a contestant?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

144
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,752
<i>Melinda Hagey.</i>

145
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,964
<i>She was the sweetest</i>
<i>kindergarten teacher ever, you guys,</i>

146
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,966
<i>and a total fan favorite.</i>

147
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,885
<i>Pretty sure she would have won</i>
<i>if she hadn't, you know--</i>

148
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,929
<i>Died, croaked, bought a pine condo.</i>

149
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,056
<i>Could you just hurry up</i>
<i>and give us the deets, please?</i>

150
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,974
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

151
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,726
<i>So, even though Melinda's body</i>
<i>was found in the lagoon</i>

152
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,438
<i>and COD was obviously drowning,</i>

153
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,440
<i>this right here, definitely a murder.</i>

154
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,943
<i>I mean, first of all, we've got</i>
<i>signs of struggle here on the beach,</i>

155
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,780
<i>and secondly a big old, hulking contusion</i>
<i>on the back of her head.</i>

156
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,950
<i>Hmm. Do we know if any of the cameras</i>
<i>caught the murder?</i>

157
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,035
<i>[man] Unfortunately, no.</i>

158
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,996
<i>Maury Novak. I'm the executive producer.</i>

159
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,583
<i>Anyway, yeah,</i>
<i>none of the cameras were rolling</i>

160
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,168
<i>'cause it was the middle of the night.</i>

161
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,003
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>we won't make that mistake again.</i>

162
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,172
<i>[Chloe] Unfortunately, </i>
<i>this is an active crime scene,</i>

163
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,215
<i>so until we process it, </i>
<i>your show's on hold.</i>

164
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,595
<i>Yes. And I will also need to watch</i>
<i>all of your unaired footage.</i>

165
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,846
<i>That's hundreds of hours.</i>

166
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,056

00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,229
<i>Uh, lead the way, please.</i>

169
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,486
<i>Right, I'm glad that's over with.</i>
<i>Where were we?</i>

170
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,071
<i>-Oh, yes. Mosquitoes, food--</i>
<i>-Do you have plans tonight?</i>

171
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,658
<i>You took the words right out of my mouth.</i>

172
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,076
<i>Detective...</i>

173
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,787

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>No.</i>

176
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,338
<i>I can't.</i>

177
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,090
<i>You cannot ask me to do that.</i>

178
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,930
<i>Listen to me, Chloe.</i>

<i>The Devil must go back to Hell.</i>

182
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,440
<i>And the only person who can send him there</i>

183
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,399
<i>is you.</i>

187
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,716
<i>What? McMillan's under the stairs.</i>

188
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,718
<i>Yep. It's cozy.</i>

189
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,096
<i>And as far away from Lucifer as possible.</i>

190
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,848
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>Did he steal your pudding again?</i>

191
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,016
<i>No.</i>

192
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,185
<i>People don't get shot</i>

{\an8}<i>Dan...</i>

194
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,356
{\an8}<i>what happened with Charlotte,</i>

{\an8}<i>Do you know what...</i>

196
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,027
{\an8}<i>Here's the deal, Chloe.</i>

197
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,696

199
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,824

{\an8}<i>just like everyone else around here.</i>

201
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,038

<i>Perhaps.</i>

214
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,827
<i>But when the circumstances pile up</i>

<i>So...</i>

247
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,771
<i>Previously on </i><span style="style1">The Cabin,</i>

248
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,402
<i>Judd the Jock had just found the totem,</i>
<i>which was buried under the tree.</i>

249
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,156
{\an8}<i>So here he is</i>
<i>just hours before Melinda got killed.</i>

250
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,825
<i>So, how did Melinda get it?</i>

251
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,162
<i>She stole it.</i>

252
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,329
{\an8}<i>That's how.</i>

253
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,498
{\an8}<i>Wait, so he killed her</i>
<i>just to get it back?</i>

254
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,791
<i>I mean, that's extreme.</i>

255
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,253
<i>Well, speaking of extreme,</i>
<i>ever heard of extreme dates?</i>

256
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,089
<i>Swimming with sharks? Jelly wrestling.</i>
<i>That's always a good ice breaker.</i>

<i>Lucifer, later...</i>

258
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,094
<i>So, did Judd do anything on the show</i>
<i>to suggest that he's violent?</i>

259
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,847
{\an8}<i>Well, Judd is the total villain</i>
<i>of the season.</i>

260
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,140
{\an8}<i>And Melinda's biggest rival.</i>

261
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,308
<i>Check it out.</i>

262
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,770
<i>Hey, Melinda. This is for trying</i>
<i>to vote me off last night, biatch.</i>

263
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,158
<i>Hmm. Well, that's enough.</i>
<i>You can pause it.</i>

264
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,536
{\an8}<i>All right, well, he's clearly guilty.</i>
<i>Let's go arrest him.</i>

265
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,747
<i>Uh, arrest him? You mean question him?</i>

266
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,165
{\an8}<i>No, you said it, he's the villain.</i>

267
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,168
{\an8}<i>If it walks like a duck, talks like</i>
<i>a duck, it probably murders like a duck.</i>

268
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,211
{\an8}<i>Oh, good idea. Duck.</i>

269
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,837
{\an8}<i>-[laughs]</i>
<i>-Let's go get him.</i>

270
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,840
{\an8}<i>Have you ever been to the Mistral?</i>
<i>They do a wonderful duck a l'orange.</i>

271
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,011
<i>[Chloe] All right, Judd.</i>
<i>Why don't you put down the axe?</i>

272
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,430
<i>-What's up?</i>
<i>-You're a killer.</i>

273
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,348
<i>That's what's up.</i>

274
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,851
<i>Er... yes, well, </i>
<i>we know that you found the totem, Judd,</i>

275
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,812
<i>and we believe that Melinda stole it</i>
<i>from you,</i>

276
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,814
<i>so perhaps you found out</i>
<i>and had a bit of a tiff.</i>

277
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:35,981
<i>What?</i>

278
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,149
<i>You guys are high.</i>

279
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,067
<i>I wish.</i>

280
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,069
<i>Why don't you just confess</i>
<i>and get it over with?</i>

281
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,823
<i>Or if you have an alibi or something,</i>
<i>now would be the time to fill us in.</i>

282
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,910
<i>We know that you have a history </i>
<i>of violence with Melinda. We've--</i>

283
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,119
<i>Yeah, I hated her.</i>

284
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,497
<i>Didn't know she stole the totem, though.</i>

285
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,332
<i>But if it was her...</i>

286
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,959
<i>I guess karma's a bitch.</i>

287
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,878
<i>If that's not a confession, </i>
<i>I don't know what is.</i>

291
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,929
<i>What's that thing you're always on about--</i>
<i>oh, yes, proof, before we arrest somebody?</i>

<i>-[clattering]</i>

<i>Uh, changing a battery.</i>

295
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,813
<i>This is an active murder investigation.</i>

296
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,940
<i>I'm sorry, my boss talked to your boss,</i>

<i>It's just for the cameras.</i>

304

<i>What do you mean, an act?</i>

00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,175
<i>It's the best way to win the cash.</i>

306
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,511

<i>So play the odds.</i>
<i>That's the role I'm playing.</i>

309

<i>Do you have an alibi?</i>

310
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,938
<i>I was asleep in the cabin</i>
<i>with the rest of the players.</i>

311
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,440
<i>They'll vouch for me.</i>

312
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,819
<i>Okay. Do you know if any of them</i>
<i>have a grudge against Melinda?</i>

313
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,778
<i>All of them.</i>

314
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,614
<i>I mean, it's a competition.</i>

315
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,116
<i>And Melinda was the most competitive</i>
<i>in the game.</i>

316
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,744
<i>I mean, she acted all sweet and innocent,</i>
<i>but...</i>

317
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,579
<i>that woman was crafty.</i>

00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,818
<i>[Linda] If you didn't come to spar,</i>
<i>why did you invite me here?</i>

329
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,821
<i>Oh, wait. Are you going to teach me</i>
<i>how to throw knives?</i>

330
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,864
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-Huh!</i>

331
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,202
<i>We're here because I don't feel welcome</i>
<i>at the apartment.</i>

332
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,455
<i>Chloe thinks I'm gonna eat Trixie</i>
<i>or something.</i>

333
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,082
<i>Chloe just needs time to adjust.</i>

334
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,708
<i>[grunts] Yeah.</i>

335
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,628
<i>I didn't react well either</i>
<i>when I first found out, remember?</i>

336
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,213
<i>[grunts] Okay!</i>

337
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,256
<i>But now, look at me, I'm fine.</i>

338
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,216
<i>[grunts]</i>

339
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,259
<i>[Linda] In fact, better than ever.</i>

340
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,136
<i>Bottom line...</i>

341
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,263
<i>don't take things personally. Okay.</i>

342
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,892
<i>Knowing that Heaven and Hell,</i>
<i>angels and demons exist, I mean...</i>

343
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,894
<i>it's...</i>

344
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,146
<i>pretty scary stuff</i>
<i>when you think about it.</i>

345
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,732
<i>So that's why you've gone full Tyson?</i>

346
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,236
<i>The Goddess of Creation</i>
<i>burns your face once and you freak out.</i>

347
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,238
<i>[panting] No. No. I mean, well...</i>

348
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,617
<i>Pierce, I mean Cain, did threaten</i>
<i>to send his thugs to murder me too,</i>

349
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,285
<i>but, you know, who's counting?</i>

350
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,538
<i>[Linda hyperventilates]</i>

351
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,872
<i>Okay, champ.</i>

352
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,834
<i>Let's take a break.</i>
<i>We've been at this for hours.</i>

353
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,210
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

354
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,753
<i>I'm fine.</i>

355
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,255
<i>I've got tons of energy.</i>

356
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,842
<i>Must be all the turmeric that</i>
<i>I keep putting in all those smoothies.</i>

357
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,428
<i>Ah... [thuds]</i>

358
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,597
<i>Linda!</i>

359
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,059
<i>Okay, listen to me.</i>

360
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,353
<i>This is your chance to come clean.</i>

361
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,355
<i>Just tell me everything you've done.</i>

362
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,815
<i>We can go from there.</i>

363
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,817
<i>I'm just playing a game, ma'am. You know?</i>

364
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,611
<i>Eating coconuts</i>
<i>and trying not to get sunburnt.</i>

365
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,821
<i>But you don't mind...</i>

366
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,656
<i>burning the other players,</i>

367
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,908
<i>even if it means destroying them, right?</i>

368
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,953
<i>[man] Hey, I'm a lawyer, I admit I'm used </i>
<i>to doing whatever it takes to win.</i>

369
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,288
<i>But I'm not gonna kill anybody.</i>

370
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,165
<i>And what about romantic liaisons?</i>

371
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,209
<i>It's hard to stop an attraction </i>
<i>just because you're working together,</i>

372
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,878
<i>I mean, playing a game.</i>

373
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,963
<i>I would never fraternize</i>
<i>with the enemy, sir.</i>

374
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,757
<i>Eyes on the prize.</i>

375
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,218
<i>But there were secret partnerships</i>
<i>going on behind people's backs, right?</i>

376
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,263
<i>Secrets are part of the game.</i>
<i>But they're part of life, too.</i>

377
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:40,142
<i>At the end of the day,</i>
<i>aren't we all putting on a facade?</i>

378
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,310
<i>Well, I know I am.</i>

379
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,938
<i>Pretending these people don't stink</i>
<i>like a pack of wildebeests.</i>

380
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,440
<i>Do they actually bathe on this show?</i>

381
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,566
<i>I can hear you.</i>

382
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,068
<i>Can you? But can you smell me?</i>

383
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,070
<i>Was Melinda colluding with anyone?</i>

384
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,197
<i>You mean was she boning someone?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

385
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,491
<i>That lawyer guy. So obvi.</i>

386
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,742
<i>My money's on Kentucky Joe.</i>

387
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,912
<i>I don't think she was canoodling</i>
<i>with anyone. She's a good girl.</i>

388
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,915
<i>But if she was, it'd be that hippie fella.</i>
<i>Hundred percent.</i>

389
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,126
<i>No clue who Melinda hooked up with.</i>
<i>I didn't really hang out with her.</i>

390
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,211
<i>She's pretty fake.</i>

391
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,130
<i>Personally, I don't trust anybody here.</i>

392
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,590
<i>They're all liars.</i>

393
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,510
<i>-[Chloe] Thank you.</i>
<i>-[Lucifer clears throat]</i>

394
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,471
<i>-[Lucifer] Thank you. We'll let you know.</i>
<i>-[Chloe] Damn it!</i>

395
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,184
<i>The more we talk to these people,</i>
<i>the less clear things are. Judd was right.</i>

396
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,311
<i>No-one's who they seem.</i>

397
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,814
<i>Isn't that the point of these programs,</i>
<i>Detective?</i>

398
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,816
<i>To show there's no such thing</i>
<i>as stereotypes.</i>

399
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,903
<i>That in real life a Mary Ann might be</i>
<i>hiding inside the body of a Ginger.</i>

400
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,073
<i>Or vice versa,</i>
<i>which is my personal preference, actually.</i>

401
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,157
<i>Right.</i>

402
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,700
<i>Take you, for example.</i>

403
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,786
<i>History and religion have...</i>

404
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,288
<i>painted a pretty awful picture of you,</i>
<i>haven't they?</i>

405
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,124
<i>You couldn't be more right, Detective.</i>

406
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,041
<i>So...</i>

407
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,085
<i>you don't bite the heads off of children?</i>

408
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,670
<i>No, of course not.</i>

409
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,754
<i>[Lucifer laughs]</i>

410
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,757
<i>I detest the little creatures. And I'd</i>
<i>certainly never put one in my mouth.</i>

411
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,716
<i>Oh.</i>

412
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,552
<i>Anyway...</i>

413
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,179
<i>I'm glad you're curious, Detective.</i>

414
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,807
<i>I was wondering when we'd get round</i>
<i>to this conversation, so...</i>

415
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,017
<i>if you have any more questions,</i>
<i>I'm all ears.</i>

416
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,227
<i>Well, Pierce...</i>

417
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,645
<i>You killed him.</i>

418
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,939
<i>So what was he? Like number nine...</i>

419
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,650
<i>million? And do you keep track?</i>

420
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,402
<i>No.</i>

421
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,904
<i>Pierce, or,</i>
<i>as I tried to tell you at the time,</i>

422
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,031
<i>when you wouldn't believe me,</i>
<i>was actually Cain...</i>

423
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,034
<i>was the first human I've ever killed.</i>

424
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,871
<i>And truth be told, he wanted to die.</i>

425
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,331
<i>Well, most of his immortal life, anyway.</i>

426
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,877
<i>What about Hell?</i>

427
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,170
<i>Ah.</i>

428
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,463
<i>Right. That's what this is about, is it?</i>

429
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,299
<i>You probably want to know</i>
<i>who's down there.</i>

430
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,884
<i>Well, many may surprise you.</i>

431
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,428
<i>Jim Morrison, for instance. Gary Coleman.</i>

432
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,554
<i>No, no. Hell.</i>

433
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,848
<i>What's it like down there?</i>

434
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,435
<i>All those people you tortured.</i>
<i>Did you enjoy it?</i>

435
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,064
<i>It was a job...</i>

436
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,691
<i>Detective.</i>

437
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,736
<i>Something I was forced to do.</i>

438
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,119
<i>Gosh. Someone's been reading</i>
<i>Dante's </i><span style="style1">Inferno.</i>

439
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,663
<i>Well, I'll admit. I... [clears throat]</i>

440
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,665
<i>...did a bit of research on my vacation.</i>

441
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,585
<i>Which is why I wanted</i>
<i>to get your side of things.</i>

442
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,130
<i>But it seems a bunch of the stuff I read</i>
<i>was way off.</i>

443
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,258
<i>Just some stereotype, right?</i>

444
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,176
<i>Right.</i>

445
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,430
<i>Linda, you scared the shit out of me.</i>

446
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,183
<i>[Maze sighs]</i>

447
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,809
<i>Here, drink.</i>

448
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,397
<i>-Okay, that's gin.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

449
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,191
<i>Only top shelf for my girl.</i>

450
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,735
<i>-What happened?</i>
<i>-You passed out.</i>

451
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,070
<i>Are you okay?</i>

452
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,738
<i>I feel fine.</i>

453
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,281
<i>I'm probably just dehydrated.</i>

454
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,993
<i>I am not an expert on the human body,</i>

455
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,954
<i>unless you count sex organs,</i>

456
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,958
<i>and I'm pretty sure you are not supposed</i>
<i>to randomly fall down.</i>

457
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,417
<i>Well...</i>

458
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,710
<i>Okay, what are you doing?</i>

459
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,258
<i>Well...</i>

460
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,218
<i>Checking to see if your eyes</i>
<i>are bleeding.</i>

461
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,469
<i>Okay, why?</i>

462
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,973
<i>Um, well, I found this medical book </i>
<i>in Lucifer's library</i>

463
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,016
<i>and it says that bleeding eyes are bad.</i>

464
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,978
<i>Okay, this book is from the 14th Century.</i>

465
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,231
<i>Fine, whatever. You're acting weird.</i>

466
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,526
<i>And I'm not leaving you alone</i>
<i>until you go see a you.</i>

467
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,528
<i>-A what?</i>
<i>-A doctor.</i>

468
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,196
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

469
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,407
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

470
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,118
<i>You bought this for Chloe?</i>

471
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,119
<i>[Lucifer] Hmm.</i>

472
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,997
<i>That is so romantic, Lucifer!</i>

473
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,748
<i>It's just like </i><span style="style1">Indecent Proposal.</i>

474
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,043
<i>Well, I was thinking</i>
<i>more like </i><span style="style1">Pretty Woman, </i><i>but yes.</i>

475
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,795
<i>Yes, we're going to the opera.</i>

476
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,673
<i>There's a special engagement</i>
<i>of </i><span style="style1">La traviata </i><i>in San Francisco.</i>

477
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,925
<i>-We leave by helicopter at sunset.</i>
<i>-Wow.</i>

478
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,262
<i>That is going to be the best date ever.</i>

479
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,722
<i>[Lucifer chuckles lightly]</i>

480
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,976
<i>-Isn't it?</i>
<i>-Yes, well...</i>

481
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,895
<i>At least I hope it is,</i>
<i>'cause if it isn't...</i>

482
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,022
<i>What?</i>

483
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,023
<i>No... [sighs]</i>

484
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,818
<i>If it isn't, I'm afraid that she might...</i>

485
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,445
<i>disappear again.</i>

486
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,156
<i>She's been acting a little odd lately.</i>
<i>Like she's...</i>

487
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,199
<i>Like she's hiding something.</i>

488
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,784
<i>Lucifer...</i>

489
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,704
<i>she's probably just as nervous</i>
<i>about this date as you are.</i>

490
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,833
<i>Trust me, when she sees this,</i>

<i>Miss Lopez, </i>
<i>I'm enjoying this new side of you.</i>

496
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,727
<i>Hey, you guys.</i>

497
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,229
<i>-Detective.</i>
<i>-Hey, Chloe. What's up?</i>

498
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,900
<i>I know that... that we had plans</i>
<i>to go out tonight, um,</i>

499
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:43,528
<i>but I've been so preoccupied</i>
<i>with this case, so...</i>

500
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,823
<i>do-- do you mind if we postpone</i>
<i>until it's solved?</i>

501
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,617
<i>-[Ella] Ah!</i>
<i>-[Chloe] Okay?</i>

502
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,327
<i>-[Ella coughs]</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

503
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,538
<i>[clears throat]</i>
<i>Yes, no, right. Of course. No rush.</i>

504
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,040
<i>Okay. Cool.</i>

505
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,917
<i>[Chloe laughs] Thanks.</i>

506
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,211
<i>Oh, buddy, bring it in.</i>

507
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,463
<i>No, it's fine. It's fine, it's fine.</i>

508
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,881
<i>Just a little hold up, that's all.</i>

509
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,883
<i>You heard what she said.</i>
<i>Solve the case and...</i>

510
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,761
<i>-we're good to go.</i>
<i>-Absolutely. [taps]</i>

511
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:08,887
<i>Yeah.</i>

512
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,811
<i>[Kinley] Detective, I got your text.</i>

513
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,230
<i>But I thought we were meeting </i>
<i>at the penthouse in two hours.</i>

514
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,358
<i>Yes. That's what I wanted</i>
<i>to chat with you about.</i>

515
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,317
<i>Right.</i>

516
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,277
<i>I sort of had to postpone....</i>

517
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,823
<i>my date with Lucifer</i>
<i>until we solve this case.</i>

518
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,203

520
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,539
<i>Oh, Chloe.</i>

521
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,166
<i>You're just stalling, aren't you?</i>

522
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,336
<i>Are you having second thoughts?</i>

523
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,214
<i>Yes.</i>

524
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,219
<i>Yes. Everything that you've told me</i>
<i>about Lucifer--</i>

525
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,971
<i>You're finding it hard to believe.</i>

526
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,180
<i>Yeah.</i>

527
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:58,812
<i>Being around him again, I just don't see</i>
<i>the same monster that you do.</i>

528
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,772
<i>No, of course you don't.</i>

529
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,442
<i>Have you met him?</i>

530
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,237
<i>Have you ever had a conversation with him?</i>

531
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,196
<i>No.</i>

532
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,198
<i>No, I...</i>

533
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,577
<i>I'm sure he's the most magnetic individual</i>
<i>you ever met.</i>

534
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,328
<i>Charming and eloquent.</i>

535
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,830
<i>Funny.</i>

536
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,498
<i>Kind, even.</i>

537
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,463
<i>Yeah. He is.</i>

538
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,673
<i>It's all an act.</i>

539
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,176
<i>Now, listen to me, Chloe.</i>

540
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,472
<i>The Devil has been manipulating</i>
<i>human beings since the beginning of time.</i>

541
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,807
<i>If you don't respond</i>
<i>favorably to something,</i>

542
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,143
<i>well, he'll make an adjustment</i>
<i>until you do.</i>

543
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,687
<i>Anything to make sure</i>
<i>he gets what he wants.</i>

544
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,815
<i>Because the only person</i>
<i>that he is interested in</i>

545
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,650
<i>is himself.</i>

546
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,404
<i>[sighs]</i>

547
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,198
<i>But it...</i>

548
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,783
<i>He seems so real.</i>

549
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:54,951
<i>Yes.</i>

550
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,786
<i>Listen. That's what he does.</i>

551
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,290
<i>That's what he's been doing</i>
<i>for thousands of years. Perfecting.</i>

552
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,962
<i>Why do you think they call him</i>
<i>the Prince of Lies?</i>

553
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,174
<i>No, n-no...</i>

554
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:14,054
<i>Lucifer always tells the truth. Always.</i>

555
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,973
<i>He does not lie.</i>

556
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,518
<i>What if this is the biggest lie of all?</i>

557
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,611

559
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,907

560
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,867

561
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,994
<i>Just some schmutz...</i>

562
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,872
<i>on the window.</i>

563
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,207
<i>[Ella] Mm-hmm.</i>

564
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,001
<i>Ah, good morning, Detective.</i>

565
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,796
<i>-Mm, thank you.</i>
<i>-Miss Lopez.</i>

566
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,172
<i>Trust you had a pleasant evening.</i>

567
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,176
<i>I did. I took my </i><span style="style1">abuelita</i><i> to the opera.</i>
<i>It was incredible.</i>

568
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,805
<i>Right. So your text said</i>
<i>that you had a new lead, Miss Lopez.</i>

569
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,807
<i>Uh, yes. Hold, please.</i>

570
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,893
<i>I wonder what she's got for us.</i>
<i>Exciting, isn't it?</i>

571
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,894
<i>Mm.</i>

572
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,854
<i>Cannot wait to solve this case.</i>

573
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,439
<i>You?</i>

574
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,732
<i>Same.</i>

575
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,025
<i>Good, good.</i>

576
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,571
<i>Because, obviously, the sooner we solve</i>
<i>the case, the sooner we go on our date.</i>

577
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,742
<i>Unless, of course,</i>
<i>you were using the case to back out..</i>

578
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,202
<i>No, we're still on.</i>

579
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,705
<i>I even marked it on my calendar.</i>

580
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,623
<i>-Wonderful. On your calendar!</i>
<i>-[Ella] Okay.</i>

581
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,459
<i>So who is ready for some stomach contents?</i>

582
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,502
<i>Me.</i>

583
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,878
<i>I know. I love this part so much.</i>

584
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:33,091
<i>Okay, so we've got rice, coconut, snails.</i>

585
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,052
<i>All typical for someone</i>
<i>on a survival reality show.</i>

586
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,470
<i>Here's what's not typical.</i>

587
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,641
<i>We got sugar, flour, cacao, raisins,</i>
<i>cherries, and rum.</i>

588
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,936
<i>Uh, that is the ingredients </i>
<i>of Hungarian rum balls.</i>

589
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,606
<i>That is oddly specific and...</i>

590
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,149
<i>actually a pretty good guess.</i>

591
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,443
<i>I spent a lot of time with Attila,</i>
<i>back in the day.</i>

592
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,862
<i>I can tell you all about it later,</i>
<i>on our date.</i>

593
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:54,863
<i>Mm.</i>

594
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,824
<i>Ella, uh, were the rum balls used</i>
<i>as a reward on the show?</i>

595
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,660
<i>Uh, not that I saw, </i>
<i>but I can check with the show's catering</i>

596
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,329
<i>if there was anything like that on set.</i>

597
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,832
<i>Good idea, Miss Lopez.</i>
<i>Let's find those balls.</i>

598
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,003

00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,548

00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,592
<i>That's great, man, but I'm...</i>

00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,553

602
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,471

<i>[clears throat] ...these treats.</i>
<i>But I didn't hurt her.</i>

656
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,924
<i>Okay? Her death is a terrible loss.</i>
<i>For me and the show.</i>

657
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,133
<i>Okay.</i>

658
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,218
<i>Why do you say that?</i>

659
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,970
<i>[sighs] The show's ratings</i>
<i>have been lower than ever this season</i>

660
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,055
<i>and I had to do something.</i>

661
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,390
<i>So I approached Melinda.</i>

662
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,935
<i>I offered her a little bit of food</i>
<i>in exchange for a favor.</i>

663
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,103
<i>Oh, now that I understand.</i>
<i>What was the favor?</i>

664
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,439
<i>Melinda was the fan favorite.</i>

665
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,276
<i>I wanted to help her win.</i>
<i>But in the most entertaining way possible.</i>

666
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,279
<i>I had this whole drama laid out.</i>
<i>It was gonna be ratings gold.</i>

667
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,531
<i>And what? She turned you down?</i>

668
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,950
<i>And you got so upset</i>
<i>that you smashed her in the head.</i>

669
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,785
<i>Look...</i>

670
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,537
<i>I may be a ratings whore...</i>

671
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,288
<i>but I would never do that.</i>

672
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,167
<i>Do you know if Melinda was conspiring</i>
<i>with anyone else on her plan?</i>

673
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,336
<i>Mm... I don't know.</i>

674
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,796
<i>[Lucifer] Oh, come on!</i>

675
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,423
<i>It was you two having the secret affair.</i>

676
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,718
<i>You both met up to enjoy your balls</i>
<i>and then you killed her.</i>

677
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,512
<i>Just admit it</i>
<i>so I can go on my bloody date!</i>

678
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,639
<i>Lucifer... Lucifer.</i>

679
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,810
<i>You really do only care about yourself,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

680
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,605
<i>Well, if that's what you think,</i>
<i>Detective...</i>

681
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,066
<i>maybe I should give you some space.</i>

682
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,363
<i>[sighs] I...</i>

683
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,574
<i>[clears throat] I want to be honest.</i>

684
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,076
<i>I wasn't having an affair with Melinda.</i>

685
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,704
<i>But I do know who was.</i>

686
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,790
<i>-[Chloe] Is that Kylie?</i>
<i>-[Maury] Yep, that's her.</i>

687
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,835
<i>Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?</i>

688
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:23,298
<i>Uh, you know, filming a bathroom,</i>
<i>that's kind of illegal, so...</i>

689
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,010
<i>So much for Kylie</i>
<i>not hanging out with Melinda.</i>

690
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,970
<i>Where is Kylie? I need to speak to her.</i>

691
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,638
<i>Come on.</i>

692
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,016
<i>She should be at the axing ceremony.</i>

693
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,476
<i>[Chloe] Hm.</i>

694
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,104
<i>Where is she?</i>

695
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,024
<i>[Maury] Hang on, I don't...</i>

696
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,942
<i>Kylie's not there.</i>

697
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,112
<i>Hang on, is that her?</i>

698
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,532
<i>-[Chloe] What is she doing?</i>
<i>-[Maury] That's the gas line.</i>

699
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,327
<i>[chuckles] Is she gonna blow up</i>
<i>the cabin? What...</i>

700
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,704
<i>Why would she do that?</i>

701
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,165
<i>[Maury] Oh, my God. I have no idea.</i>

702
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,876
<i>-[Chloe] What is she--</i>
<i>-At least it's, um...</i>

703
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,836
<i>-Detective?</i>
<i>-Yeah?</i>

704
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,673
<i>[Maury] Isn't that...</i>

<i>[screams] No!</i>

707
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,923
<i>[whispering] How is he doing that?</i>

708
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,474
<i>[Chloe gasps]</i>

709
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,978
<i>I wouldn't go in there, Detective.</i>
<i>It's hotter than...</i>

710
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,437
<i>Well, you know.</i>

711
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,355
<i>[Chloe] Yeah.</i>

712
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,399
<i>It blew up.</i>

713
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,442
<i>Uh...</i>

714
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,194
<i>I saw it. I...</i>

715
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,197
<i>I was so scared, but you...</i>

716
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,491
<i>You walked right through.</i>

717
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,619
<i>You're fine. I--</i>

718
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,372
<i>You're completely fine.</i>

719
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:24,419
<i>Well, it's one of the perks of living</i>
<i>in a fiery pit of despair most of my life.</i>

720
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,129
<i>[sighs]</i>

721
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,464
<i>[Kylie] I...</i>

722
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,550
<i>I didn't know anybody was in there.</i>

723
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:31,884
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

724
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,678
<i>Thank God you're okay.</i>

725
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,972
<i>Well, He certainly had nothing to do</i>
<i>with it.</i>

726
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,474
<i>[Kylie] I'm sorry, I just...</i>

727
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,769
<i>I needed to burn it all down.</i>
<i>I needed for it to be over.</i>

728
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,355
<i>I can't believe I almost did it again.</i>

729
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,815
<i>Did what again?</i>

730
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,488
<i>[siren wailing]</i>

731
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,115
<i>[Kylie] I never thought she'd go for me.</i>

732
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,785
<i>I mean, for one, she was straight, but...</i>

733
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,163
<i>Melinda was so...</i>

734
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,581
<i>sweet.</i>

735
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,375
<i>Can you believe she thought I was sweet?</i>

736
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,169
<i>No one ever thinks I'm sweet.</i>

737
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,046
<i>So what happened?</i>

738
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,090
<i>I saw Melinda go</i>
<i>into Maury's cabin that night.</i>

739
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,092
<i>And I knew I'd been a total idiot.</i>

740
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,261
<i>She'd completely fooled me.</i>

741
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,222
<i>What if we told you</i>
<i>Melinda wasn't sleeping with Maury?</i>

742
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,640
<i>Yeah, that's what she said, too.</i>

743
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,684
<i>But she also wouldn't tell me</i>
<i>what she was doing,</i>

744
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,436
<i>so I knew she was lying about something.</i>

745
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,439
<i>Whatever it was, I was being played.</i>

746
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:28,983
<i>So I got upset.</i>

747
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,695
<i>I just pushed her in the lagoon.</i>

748
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,240
<i>But I guess she hit her head.</i>

749
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,035
<i>I-- I would never...</i>

750
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,539
<i>Whatever she'd done...</i>

751
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,208
<i>I loved her.</i>

752
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,921
<i>[Chloe sighs] Thanks.</i>

753
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,549
<i>Well, then...</i>

754
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,552
<i>I guess that's case closed.</i>

755
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,513
<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>I understand that you and me, it's...</i>

759
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,275
<i>The last thing I want to do is push you</i>
<i>into something you don't want.</i>

760
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,819
<i>So if you're not ready...</i>

761
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,364
<i>or you don't want to go</i>
<i>on a date with me...</i>

<i>Uh, why don't I just meet you</i>
<i>at your place?</i>
