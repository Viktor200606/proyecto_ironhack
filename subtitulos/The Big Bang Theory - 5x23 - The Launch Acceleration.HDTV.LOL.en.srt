1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,800
Howard Wolowitz.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey, Howard.
Dave Roeger here at NASA.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,300
We need to talk
about your upcoming mission.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,300
Yes, yes, I've been doing
my push-ups.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,400
I'm still stuck at nine, but...

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,400
...that's going all the way down
with no one holding me.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,900
That's great, uh,
but that's not why I called.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,000
We've run into a bit of a snafu.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,600
Your Soyuz capsule failed
the pressurization test,

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,100
so bottom line,
mission's been scrubbed.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,000
You're kidding.
So what does that mean?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,900
Uh-huh.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,700
Uh-huh.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,700
Boy, I got to tell you,

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,400
I'm really disappointed.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,800
This was my dream

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,900
ever since I was a little kid.

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,700
Okay, well, uh,

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,700
thanks for the call.

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,400
Yep, you, too.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,100
Yes! Thank you!

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,700
Oh! Oh...

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not gonna die in space!

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,200
I'm gonna die
the way God intended,

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,500
in my late 50s,
with a heart full of pastrami.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,800
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,700
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,200
? The Earth began to cool ?

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,100
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

30
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,100
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,900
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

32
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,000
? That all started
with a big bang ?

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000

36
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,100
I'm going to need
a larger shirt.

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,700
This one's a little tight
under the arms.

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
Okay.

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,500
Do you think maybe it's tight

40
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
because you're wearing
long underwear?

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Yes, of course
that's why it's tight.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
All right, let me
rephrase the question.

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,100
Why are you wearing
long underwear?

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,600
You're kidding.

45
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,700
Shouldn't the question be:
why <i>aren't</i> you?

46
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,100
No, it should be: why are you?
(sighs) Leonard,

47
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,300
these rental tuxedos have been

48
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,400
worn by hundreds
of sweaty strangers.

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,400
I don't like my own sweat
touching my skin,

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,600
how do you think
I feel about theirs?

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,300
Why don't you
slip this on?

52
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,400
Said the hangman
offering a noose.

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
Well, that wasn't
as entertaining

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,100
as when he rents bowling shoes,

55
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,000
but it was right up there.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,100
Well, that's it.

57
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,900
My orders have been rescinded.

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,300
I am officially "no go"
to space.

59
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,500
I'm sorry, Howard,
but I got to tell you,

60
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm a little relieved
you're not going.

61
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,600
Why?

62
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Come on, you were
gonna go up in a rocket

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,800
designed in the 1960s
by the Russians.

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,100
Yeah, so?

65
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,100
When was the last time
you were at Best Buy

66
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,300
and you heard someone say, "Ooh,
check out this Blu-ray player,

67
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,700
it must be good,
it was built in Russia"?

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,800
Well, their technology
isn't that bad.

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,200
When you come back to Earth
in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall

70
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
from space
at 500 miles per hour,

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
and the only thing
that slows you down

72
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,900
is a little parachute
that pops out

73
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,700
right before you crash
into the ground.

74
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,100
And the whole thing
was designed

75
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,700
by the same brilliant minds
who were unable to capture

76
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,800
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
All right, well, whatever.

78
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
I wasn't worried.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,200
You weren't?

80
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,800
Let me explain the difference
between you and me.

81
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,200
You watch

82
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,800
<i>Star Trek;</i> I live it.

83
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, please. I don't remember
the episode of <i>Star Trek</i>

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,600
where the guy
never goes to space

85
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,300
and brags about it
in a tuxedo store.

86
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,700
Make all the jokes you want,

87
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,800
but there's only
one of us here brave enough

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,200
to almost do
what I almost did.

89
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,300
Ah, much better.

90
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,600
You must be burning up.

91
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,100
A little. But not more
than your urethras

92
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,100
will be after whatever's
in those pants swims up them.

93
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,900
Well...

94
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,600
I cut quite the dashing,
yet hygienic figure, don't I?

95
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,900
I look like the Flash
about to get married.

96
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,700
Oh! A tissue! A tissue!

97
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,100
Oh, good Lord!

98
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,300
Uh, where's he going?

99
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,800
He keeps emergency
Purell in the car.

100
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,300
Keys! Keys! Keys!

101
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,000
Hey, you.
Before I come in,

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,300
you should know, I have gas.

103
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,700
For the record,
not your worst opening line.

104
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,600
Check it out.
It's the gas I use

105
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
in my free-electron laser
to support high voltages.

106
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,100
<i>But</i> it also has an
interesting secondary use.

107
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,300
Here. Breathe this in.

108
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,200
B-Before I do it, if you're
a cop you have tell me, right?

109
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Just try it.

110
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,400
Okay.

111
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,200
What's it supposed to...

112
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Oh, my God, that's so freaky!

113
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,000
? You're a mean one ?

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,300
? Mr. Grinch. ?

115
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,200
Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?

116
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,000
Leonard, I am your father.

117
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
I have never been
more attracted to a woman

118
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,200
who sounds like a man
in my life.

119
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh...

120
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,100
Mm.

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,400
Hey... you know
how we've been...

122
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,300
taking things slow?
Mm-hmm.

123
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,100
Well, I've been thinking, and...

124
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,000
maybe I'm ready to...

125
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,400
take things a little... faster.

126
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,900
Oh...

127
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,100
great.
Mm-hmm.

128
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,200
And I promise,
after waiting four months,

129
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,500
fast is what you're gonna get.

130
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,100
You know, just-just one thing.

131
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,900
Look, we're in a really
great place right now,

132
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,200
and I don't want to do anything

133
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
that will make stuff
all weird again.

134
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,800
So we won't let it get weird.

135
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,200
Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up...

136
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,400
mm, since the last time
you saw me naked,

137
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,000
I got a Cookie Monster tattoo.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,700
The acceptable responses
when you see it

139
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,400
are "awesome" or nothing.

140
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,500
What about...

141
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,400
Cookies!

142
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,500
Amy?

143
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,800
Amy?

144
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,100
Amy?

145
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,300
7:00, right on time.

146
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,600
It's not an accident.

147
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,300
I waited outside your door
for 20 minutes.

148
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,500
Well, dinner's almost ready.

149
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,900
I must say,

150
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,400
I was surprised
you chose to spend

151
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
our date night
in your apartment.

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,300
As I mentioned,

153
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,600
the Pasadena City Council is
debating longer crosswalk times,

154
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,900
and later, the LEGO store is
having a midnight madness sale.

155
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,300
You ask anyone,

156
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,700
that's a hot date.

157
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,700
Tempting choices,
but I have something special

158
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,000
planned for tonight.

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,600
What can be more special
than having

160
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,900
an adequate amount of time
to cross the street

161
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,500
on your way to buy
a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?

162
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,900
With our friends moving forward
in their relationships,

163
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,100
I've decided that we should
make progress in ours as well.

164
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,200
Oh, dear Lord.

165
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,900
Two years ago,
we didn't even know each other,

166
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,200
and now I'm
in your apartment after dark.

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How much faster
can this thing go?

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
I had a feeling
you'd be reluctant,

169
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,700
which is why
I'm going to dip

170
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,500
into my neurobiological
bag of tricks.

171
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, you brain monkeys
kill me. Dip away.

172
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,200
I have devised

173
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,000
an experiment that
I believe will increase

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,600
your feelings for me
in an accelerated time frame.

175
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,800
And how do you propose
to do that?

176
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,100
Uh, hope you're not thinking

177
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,700
about some sort
of LSD thought control.

178
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,000
Because there's

179
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,200
only one mind-expanding drug
that this man enjoys,

180
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
and that's called school.

181
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,800
Human beings form emotional
attachments as they grow up.

182
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,900
In your case, to your mother,
superheroes, et cetera.

183
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm going to attempt

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,400
an experiment that will
get you to transfer

185
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,000
those feelings to me.

186
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
Well,

187
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,800
seems what's on the menu tonight

188
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,000
is malarkey with
a big side of poppycock.

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,500
We'll see.

190
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's start with a little
romantic dinner music, shall we?

191
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,500
Super Mario Bros. theme?

192
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,700
Yes.

193
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,400
I see what you're doing.

194
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,000
You're attempting
to build on the work

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,200
of Ebbinghaus by triggering

196
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
an involuntary memory
of me playing that game--

197
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,700
admittedly the happiest
600 hours of my childhood...

198
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,800
...but it won't work.

199
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,700
Fine. There's no reason
we still can't have

200
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,700
a lovely dinner.
Why don't you have a seat.

201
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Boink! Boink!

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
May I offer you
something to drink?

203
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,600
You know I don't drink.

204
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,900
Not even...

205
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,100
strawberry Quik?

206
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,400
I love strawberry Quik.

207
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,600
It's my favorite
pink fluid,

208
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
narrowly beating out
Pepto-Bismol.

209
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,800
Oh, I know.

210
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,600
I think it will go nicely

211
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,400
with what I have prepared...

212
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,900
for dinner.

213
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Spaghetti with little pieces
of hot dog cut up in it!

214
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,100
Just like your mommy
used to make.

215
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Oh...

216
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,800
yummy, yummy!

217
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
We should do this more often.

218
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,500
Uh-oh.

219
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,900
I'm sorry. I did,

220
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,400
I crossed a line.
I didn't mean to!

221
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,300
Who says something
like that right in the middle

222
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,700
of sex?!
I don't know,

223
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
it just came out.
People say weird things

224
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,100
during sex all the time.

225
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,400
Okay, well, they
sure as hell don't say that.

226
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,100
It was the heat of the moment.
No,

227
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,700
the heat of the moment is,
"Ooh, yeah, just like that,"

228
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,500
not "will you marry me?"

229
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,700
I'm sorry.

230
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,400
Just-just give me
another chance.

231
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,300
Why, so you can crawl
under the covers and go,

232
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,800
"Hey, baby,
want to go look for houses

233
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,500
in neighborhoods
with good schools?"

234
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,800
Again, I'm sorry.

235
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,000
You know, with Howard
and Bernadette getting married,

236
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,400
I got caught up
in a little wedding fever.

237
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
I take it back.
You can't

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,300
take something like that back.

239
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,800
I mean, what are we
even supposed to do now?

240
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,500
Okay, at some point,
we'll look back

241
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,600
and this is going
to be a funny story.

242
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,100
Why don't we just
start doing that now?

243
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,900
You're kidding.
No.

244
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,100
Hey, do you remember...

245
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,900
...that time when I proposed

246
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,700
to you in bed?

247
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,200
And you were all, like,
"What are <i>you</i> doing?"

248
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,400
That was so funny.

249
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,400
So funny.

250
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,700
It's not funny.

251
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,700
Give it a minute.

252
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,400
Is that a little smile
I see there?

253
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,900
I should go.

254
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,800
Hey, I was thinking.

255
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
For our first dance
at the wedding,

256
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,700
what if we learn the final number
from <i>Dirty Dancing?</i>

257
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,100
You're kidding.
No,

258
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,500
come on.

259
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,900
How cool would that be?

260
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,800
Me running
into your arms...

261
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,100
you lifting me up
into the air.

262
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,900
Oh, you're in a good mood.

263
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,300
Yeah, well, why
wouldn't I be?

264
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,700
You know, I'm marrying
the girl of my dreams,

265
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,500
and I finally got
my mother to agree

266
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,900
not to come on
our honeymoon.

267
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, hang on.

268
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh, it's NASA.

269
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,500
Wolowitz.

270
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,500
Oh! Hi, Dave.
What's up?

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,500
No kidding. Really?

272
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,700
Well,

273
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,300
that's... great news.

274
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,200
Great, great news.

275
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
All right, I'll watch my e-mail

276
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
for the details.

277
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,100
Okay, talk soon.

278
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,700
What's so great?

279
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,000
It looks like I'm going
into space after all.

280
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,800
Oh, Howie,
that's wonderful!

281
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Uh-huh, wonderful.

282
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,400
Yay...

283
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,800
What happened?
I thought

284
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,000
they canceled your mission.
Th-They did.

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,200
But NASA really wants

286
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,500
my telescope up
on the space station,

287
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,400
so they're putting me
on an earlier launch.

288
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
When?
A...

289
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,700
week from Friday.

290
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,600
What? We're getting
married that Sunday.

291
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,800
You're right!

292
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,500
I-I can't go to space.

293
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,000
I have to get married,
and no one can say

294
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,300
that's not a good reason.
I'll call him back.

295
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,000
Wait. I don't want to be

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,800
the one who stands
in your way.

297
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,600
Well, too bad, you already did.
It's a done deal.

298
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,800
Oh, well.
But I forgive you.

299
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,100
No. That's not how I want
to start our marriage,

300
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,500
killing your dream?

301
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,400
We'll have the wedding
when you get back.

302
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,900
But wh-what about

303
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,900
all the plans
and the guests?

304
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,000
We'll call them.

305
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,000
Although my dad's
gonna go a little nutso

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,100
over losing his deposits.

307
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,000
You're right, he is!

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
Your dad's gonna be furious.

309
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,600
There's no way he's
gonna let us postpone this wedding.

310
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Well, we tried.

311
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,700
I'll talk to him.

312
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,300
He won't say no to his little girl.
No!

313
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,100
I-I should talk to him,

314
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,600
man to man.

315
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
But, Howie, my dad
can be a bully.

316
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
He's gonna make you cancel
your space flight.

317
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,700
We can only hope...

318
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,900
that he doesn't.

319
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,300
Bishop to queen four,

320
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,000
level two.

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,900
Check.

322
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,600
Sheldon...

323
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,200
knight takes bishop.

324
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,100
You all right?

325
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,300
I'm fine.

326
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,400
Are you?

327
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,600
You left your queen
exposed from above,

328
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
you trapped your
knight in the corner,

329
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,900
and you keep sighing
and saying, "Why me?"

330
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,000
Very well.

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,100
Can I ask you
a question about women?

332
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,400
We got you that book last year.

333
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,300
Wasn't everything in there?

334
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,300
No, I'm having
a relationship problem with Amy.

335
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
And by the way,

336
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,600
that book gave me nightmares.

337
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,400
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

338
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,100
I screwed things up
pretty good with Penny.

339
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,600
Look at us,
Leonard...

340
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,400
engaging in the social
convention of men bellyaching

341
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,600
about their ol' ladies.

342
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,700
I guess we are.

343
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,500
So, what's going on?

344
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,200
Believe it or not,

345
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,600
Amy has embarked on a campaign

346
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,500
to increase my feelings
for her by making me happy.

347
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,600
I'm sorry, that must be very
difficult for you.

348
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
It's awful.

349
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
This morning,
she arranged for me

350
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,200
to be an Amtrak junior conductor
for the day.

351
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,300
It-It's usually

352
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,500
only open to children.

353
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,600
She got them
to make an exception.

354
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000
Shame on her.

355
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,900
They let me
blow the whistle, Leonard.

356
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,000
She's good.

357
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I know.

358
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,700
<i>And</i> it gets worse.

359
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,600
Her efforts are causing me

360
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,900
to have affectionate
feelings for her

361
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,000
at inappropriate times.

362
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,800
You mean, like in bed
or in the shower?

363
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,200
No!

364
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,400
Would you please stop
referencing that infernal book?

365
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,500
For example, this morning,

366
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,800
I was calculating
the random motion

367
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
of virtual particles
in a vacuum,

368
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,600
when suddenly
the particles morphed

369
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,100
into an image
of Amy's dandruff...

370
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,000
...gently cascading down

371
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,800
onto her pale,
slightly hunched shoulders.

372
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,400
What has that vixen
done to me, Leonard?

373
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,100
And how do I make it stop?

374
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Well, if you had
a physical relationship,

375
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,400
I'd say propose during sex.

376
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,700
Turns out that's
a real mood killer.

377
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,500
I assume we're talking
about you now?

378
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,400
Yeah.

379
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
So, that's
how this works?

380
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,900
I complain,
and then you complain,

381
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,600
and no one offers any solutions?

382
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,400
Pretty much.

383
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,600
Well, no wonder
the women are winning.

384
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,600
Mr. Rostenkowski,
are you busy?

385
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,300
Oh, just looking at some
old pictures. Come on in.

386
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,800
Family pictures,
or...?

387
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,100
H-Holy crap, that's
a dead person.

388
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,300
Last murder case
before I retired.

389
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
How many bodies
do you see there?

390
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,500
Careful,

391
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,800
it's a trick question.

392
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm not sure.

393
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
Nah, you'll never get it.

394
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,200
It's a fraction.

395
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,400
How about that.

396
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,500
Anyway,

397
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
sir, I need to talk
to you about something.

398
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,800
Walnut?

399
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,500
No, thank you.

400
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,900
I'm allergic.

401
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,600
Oh, sure.

402
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,900
My partner used to have that.

403
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,600
He's dead now.

404
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,600
From nuts?

405
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,300
Nah, his wife shot him.

406
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,100
But she was nuts,
so in a way...

407
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,300
Nice story.

408
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,000
Anyway,

409
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
the reason I wanted
to talk to you is

410
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,100
NASA has moved up
my launch

411
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,400
to the International
Space Station.

412
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,200
Yeah, so?
So...

413
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,700
the date is going
to conflict

414
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,800
with me marrying
your daughter.

415
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,000
Now, I know what you're
going to say-- I made

416
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
a commitment to Bernadette
and to your family

417
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and I've got a hell
of a lot of nerve

418
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,200
coming in here and demanding
that we postpone this thing.

419
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,800
Well, message heard
and understood.

420
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,500
Mission canceled.
Thank you.

421
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,100
Where are you going?

422
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,900
I'm sorry.

423
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,400
May I be excused?

424
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,900
No, you may not.

425
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,300
Let me tell you something.

426
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,200
When I first met you...

427
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,600
You just gonna stand there?

428
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm sorry, I didn't know,
is this going to...

429
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,600
Well, I should sit...

430
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,300
May I be seat...
Well, I'll just sit.

431
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,800
When I first met you,

432
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
I didn't like you.

433
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,800
I'm aware of that, sir.

434
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
But then you and I
had some time together.

435
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Uh-huh.

436
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,700
It did not get better.

437
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,000
Right, right.

438
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,100
That silly Beatle haircut

439
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,300
and...

440
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,400
you riding around
on a red Vespa,

441
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,300
and you're still living
at home with your mother.

442
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,300
To be honest, I thought
Bernadette chose you

443
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,100
to punish me.

444
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,500
But then I heard about
your astronaut thing,

445
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,100
and I realized

446
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,300
I judged you too fast.

447
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,700
Maybe you are

448
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,600
the right guy
for my little girl.

449
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,900
Oh, I am.
And just so you know,

450
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,100
I'd still be an astronaut,
even if I didn't go to space.

451
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,100
I've got an I.D. card
and a NASA golf shirt.

452
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,600
No, no, you got to go.

453
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
You can't turn down
an opportunity like this.

454
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,200
B-But what about the wedding

455
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,900
and all the money you put
down for the reception?

456
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,800
You let me worry about that.

457
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,600
You go up to that
space station,

458
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,800
and you make me proud.

459
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,500
Um, okay.

460
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
You got a problem with that?

461
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,100
All right, look, I'm
gonna level with you.

462
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,400
I'm terrified about
going into space.

463
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,000
What if I don't
make it back?

464
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,600
It's gonna be okay, son.

465
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,000
You really think so?

466
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,900
Of course.

467
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,500
A pretty girl like Bernadette...

468
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,000
she'll find a new guy.

469
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,100
Hey.

470
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,400
Hey.

471
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,600
Off to work?

472
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,700
Yeah.

473
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,000
Have a nice night.

474
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,700
Okay, you, too.

475
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,100
Penny, just, wait.

476
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,000
I've been thinking
about what I said

477
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
when we were in bed
the other night.

478
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,100
Yeah, I've been
thinking about it, too.

479
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,600
I noticed you never answered me.

480
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,400
You're right.

481
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,400
No.

482
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,700
Uh, follow-up.
Are we still dating?

483
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,100
Yep.

484
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,800
Is it still weird
'cause I proposed?

485
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,500
Yep.

486
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
I have a couple more
quick questions.

487
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,700
Do you want to call me
from the car?

488
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
No!

489
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,700
Think I played that
pretty well.

490
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Hello, Leonard.

491
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
What are you doing?

492
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,200
We're playing doctor.

493
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,000
<i>Star Trek</i> style.

494
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,300
I'm in hell, Leonard.

495
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,800
Don't stop.
