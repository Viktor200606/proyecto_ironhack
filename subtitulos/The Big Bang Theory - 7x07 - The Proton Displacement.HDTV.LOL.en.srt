1
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,600
I've never seen him
this happy before.

2
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:11,751
That's because
you've never seen him

3
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:14,104
on "Restock
the Medicine Cabinet Day."

4
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:15,421
Look!

5
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:17,891
A new topical antihistamine
with lidocaine.

6
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,125
Wow!

7
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:21,945
I can't wait until I get a rash.

8
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:26,399
Oh, Gas-X has
a new ultra strength.

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,487
I guess they really do
read their mail.

10
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,123
Hey, isn't that
Professor Proton?

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,774
Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:41,398
Look at him,
just standing in line

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,135
like he wasn't moderately
famous 30 years ago.

14
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:46,670
Let's go say hello.

15
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,955
Oh, maybe we shouldn't
bother him.

16
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:51,124
I'm not going to bother him,
I'm going to talk to him.

17
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:54,811
He thinks there's
a difference.

18
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:56,062
Arthur?

19
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,814
Arthur, it's me--

20
00:00:57,816 --> 00:00:59,149
Sheldon Cooper.

21
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:02,769
You may not remember because
of your advanced age.

22
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,439
Trust me, I... I remember.

23
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,491
This is my girlfriend, Amy.

24
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:10,860
Amy, this is television legend
Arthur Jeffries.

25
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,981
His science show inspired
millions of children.

26
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:16,482
Hold-Hold-Hold on.

27
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:20,370
You... You have a girlfriend?

28
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,039
Yes, and I've heard
so much about you.

29
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,292
Hey look-- we're wearing
the same orthopedic shoes.

30
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:30,329
I can't believe
I dress like a celebrity.

31
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:35,769
O-Okay, I get it now.

32
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:38,788
Dr. Jeffries, hello again.
Leonard Hofstadter.

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,275
Oh, oh, right, I remember
your-your girlfriend.

34
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:47,363
Is-Is she... is she here?

35
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:49,149
No, she's not.

36
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,458
So, what prescription
are you getting filled?

37
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,157
Sheldon.

38
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:54,182
No. Wait, I want to guess.
Don't tell me.

39
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:58,041
I wasn't going to tell you.

40
00:01:58,043 --> 00:01:59,358
Sheldon, come on.

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,194
No, no, no.
I'm really good at this.

42
00:02:01,196 --> 00:02:02,996
All right, give me a hint.

43
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,532
Does it involve difficulty
initiating a stream of anything?

44
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:12,272
Well, given my age, that's more
than just a lucky guess.

45
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:13,890
Hey, Sheldon, let's go
mock the people

46
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:17,043
buying homeopathic medicine--
you love that.

47
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:18,428
But I'm hanging out
with my friend,

48
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,378
and we're having fun.

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,514

60
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:57,490
Bernie's having a girls' night
on Friday at our place.

61
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:58,741
You want to do
something?

62
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:01,711
Actually, I'm busy.
Doing what?

63
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:04,247
There's a new sports bar
over on Colorado Ave...

64
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:06,816
You're going to girls' night.
Yeah.

65
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:10,119
You know they're making
jewelry right?

66
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:12,572
You think they
came up with that?

67
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:16,292
They were going to drink beer
and play darts.

68
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:17,293
What's up?

69
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:19,596
Not his
testosterone levels.

70
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,347
Excuse me.

71
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:23,883
I happen to be very comfortable
with my masculinity.

72
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:27,103
How is that possible?

73
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:33,893
Hey, I got an email
from Professor Proton.

74
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:35,778
Goody!
What's it say?

75
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,064
He's working on a paper
about nano vacuum tubes,

76
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:40,766
and wants to know if I'd
take a look at it.

77
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:42,768
That's strange.

78
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,622
That he would come to you
for that and not me.

79
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:48,941
Oh, I got two emails from him.

80
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,114
"Do you have Leonard's
email address?"

81
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:56,699
And...

82
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:59,285
"Never mind, I found it."

83
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:03,172
I can't believe
he picked you over me.

84
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:05,808
You don't want to read a paper
by some old has-been

85
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,479
who hasn't done any real
science in decades.

86
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:11,114
Yeah, it's nothing
to cry about.

87
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,850
Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

88
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:16,969
It's true, you'd rust.

89
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:23,826
And to think I idolized
that man.

90
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:25,495
And why?

91
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:29,282
At the end of the day he's just
another Hollywood phony.

92
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:31,334
Is it really worth
getting upset about?

93
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:33,086
They say don't meet your heroes.

94
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:34,704
Don't peek behind

95
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:36,589
that curtain of fame
and celebrity,

96
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:39,042
because if you do, you'll see
them as they really are--

97
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:43,046
degenerate carnival folk.

98
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:45,765
Come on, he's a retired
kids show host.

99
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:46,716
That's even worse.

100
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,885
Using the sweet
candy of science

101
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:51,304
to trick children
into loving him.

102
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:53,506
Pervert.

103
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:57,477
Have you ever thought about

104
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,346
why Arthur didn't want you
to read his paper?

105
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:01,814
Yes, I have.

106
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,232
And my only conclusion

107
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,485
is the prescription he was
picking up the other day

108
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:08,020
was for cuckoo pills.

109
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:11,407
Maybe he found you,
um, a bit much.

110
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:13,876
That's kind of a stretch.

111
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,528
Look, when it comes

112
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,964
to social skills, I've
mastered the big three.

113
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:19,832
There's the coy smile.

114
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:23,469
There's the friendly
chuckle.

115
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,891
There's the vocalization
of sympathy.

116
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:30,727
Aw...

117
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,381
That last one's tricky,
I'm still working on it.

118
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:37,317
From what I saw the other day,

119
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,936
I could understand
why he and...

120
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:42,722
some people
might find you...

121
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:46,059
What?

122
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:48,995
Doesn't matter.

123
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:52,064
No, go ahead, say it.

124
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,000
I know what it is.

125
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:55,501
I've heard it my whole life.

126
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:56,586
The word's "annoying".

127
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:57,754
Go ahead, say it.

128
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:59,572
Say it.
Say I'm annoying.

129
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:00,757
Sheldon...

130
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,375
Oh, it won't hurt my feelings.

131
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:03,760
Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying.

132
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:06,262
I'm annoying.
I'm annoying.

133
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:07,864
I'm annoying.
Yeah, now, uh...

134
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,132
Now where
are you going?

135
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,250
Look, you know
you want to say it-- say it.

136
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:13,636
Say I'm annoying.
Go ahead, say it.

137
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:17,340
Say it. Say it.
Amy, say it.

138
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,729
Well, she can't stand it
when I'm right.

139
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:25,615
This is fun.

140
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:27,900
I'm going to feel like
such a vixen wearing jewelry

141
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:31,120
that doesn't have a list
of medications I'm allergic to.

142
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:33,072
Penny, how's it
going over there?

143
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:36,626
Good-- I'm just having
little trouble with the glue.

144
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:39,212
How do you not know
how to use glue?

145
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:41,364
Did you ditch pre-school?

146
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,967
Yeah, but only because I was
dating a second grader.

147
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:48,788
Hello, everyone.

148
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,723
Okay, let me have it.

149
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:53,459
Let's hear all
the "Raj is a girl" jokes.

150
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:54,811
Nope.

151
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:57,630
Bernadette told me it isn't
nice and I'm not allowed.

152
00:06:57,632 --> 00:06:58,648
Thank you.

153
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,066
So I won't be making
fun of you,

154
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:01,267
or the things you like,

155
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,736
or the fact that you
just want to have fun.

156
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:08,191
Howie, stop.

157
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,359
Come on,
look at what I'm making.

158
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:13,196
Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

159
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:14,313
I'm making a bracelet.

160
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:16,115
Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

161
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:21,387
You know, instead of
beads and glue,

162
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,922
you guys can use
my soldering iron.

163
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:24,590
You'd be able to make
much cooler stuff.

164
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:28,160
Oh, I think we're doing
just fine, thank you.

165
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:30,296
Actually, I'd kind of like to try that.
Me, too.

166
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:31,431
Be right back.

167
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:35,685
When did I have pistachios?

168
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:41,841
Arthur.

169
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:43,342
Arthur.

170
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:46,479
Arthur.

171
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:48,981
Door knocker.

172
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:50,867
That's TV money.

173
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:55,738
Sheldon,
what are you doing here?

174
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,491
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

175
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:01,294
Of course you woke me,
it's 7:30.

176
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:04,363
Well, I would
have been here sooner,

177
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,198
but for some reason your home

178
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,502
isn't on this map
of Hollywood stars.

179
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:11,504
What do you want, Sheldon?

180
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:14,206
It's been pointed out
by my girlfriend

181
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,477
that I may have been
annoying to you.

182
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,046
She sounds like a keeper.

183
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:22,815
Anyway, I wanted to apologize.

184
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:24,984
I am truly sorry.

185
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:27,153
All right, apology accepted.
Have a nice night.

186
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:30,490
No, no, now that...
we've cleared the air,

187
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:33,242
I wanted to discuss another
matter with you.

188
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:35,244
Sheldon, in a couple hours,
I have to get up,

189
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:39,832
pee and then wander
around the house.

190
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:46,539
Well, then,
I'll make this quick.

191
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,909
Um, I want to talk about
the paper you sent Leonard.

192
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,844
Now, I know he said
it's promising

193
00:08:51,846 --> 00:08:53,596
and he's going
to collaborate on it,

194
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:56,048
but now that you and I
are friends again,

195
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,517
I am at your disposal.

196
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,352
Frankly,
lending my name

197
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:02,104
and reputation to it will help,
because a lot of people think

198
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:04,473
that you're a washed-up
has-been.

199
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:07,259
Or dead.

200
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:10,897
I should be so lucky.

201
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:13,098
So, uh, what do you say?

202
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,201
You know, if it's
all the same with you,

203
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,236
I think I'll stick with Leonard.

204
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:19,372
It's because
I'm annoying, right?

205
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:21,240
I know it is.
Say it.

206
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:22,942
Say it.
Say I'm annoying.

207
00:09:22,944 --> 00:09:24,293
Good night.
Say it.

208
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:26,445
Arthur, say it.
Say I'm annoying.

209
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:28,113
Say it. Say it.

210
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:30,466
I'm annoying.
Say it.

211
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,052
You're annoying!

212
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:48,691
If you would have told me
when I was a kid

213
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:50,527
that someday I would
be doing science

214
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:53,863
next to Professor Proton,
I would not have believed you.

215
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:55,331
If someone had told me

216
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,617
that people would still
call me Professor Proton

217
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,452
when I was 83 years old,

218
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:02,188
I never would have
quit smoking.

219
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:07,377
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries,
I'm just excited.

220
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:10,747
This nano vacuum tube idea of
yours is really interesting.

221
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:11,748
Hello, Leonard.

222
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,466
Oh, hello, Arthur.

223
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:16,035
What an odd coincidence
that you're both here.

224
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:17,387
Why is it odd?

225
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,373
Because as it just so happens,
I'm also spending the day

226
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,376
with a beloved children's
television science personality.

227
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:25,595
Isn't that right,
new friend and colleague,

228
00:10:25,597 --> 00:10:27,730
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

229
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:35,655
Sorry, I replaced you
with a newer model.

230
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:38,274
Wow, Arthur Jeffries.

231
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:39,558
It's an honor
to meet you.

232
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,778
My show never would have
happened without yours.

233
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,997
That's what
I told my lawyers.

234
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,333
Mr. Nye, hello.

235
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:50,086
I'm sorry he got you
involved in this nonsense.

236
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:53,089
He said I'd be
speaking to a class.

237
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:55,425
No, I said you were
teaching someone a lesson.

238
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:56,626
Now let's go.

239
00:10:58,295 --> 00:10:59,762
What are you guys
working on?

240
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:01,798
Oh, uh, we're making
nano vacuum tubes.

241
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,049
Oh...

242
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:04,583
That's interesting.

243
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:06,302
Haven't you stolen
enough from me?

244
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:08,805
Back off, bow tie!

245
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,311
Hey, guys...

246
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:16,946
What do you think?

247
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:19,232
Wow, Penny,
good job.

248
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:21,117
Thanks.
Target, $4.99.

249
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,285
I'm getting a drink.

250
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:24,921
What are you working on?

251
00:11:24,923 --> 00:11:26,823
Oh, I'm making
a necklace for my mom.

252
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:27,907
That's sweet.

253
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:29,108
Yeah, she and
my dad are

254
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,576
going through a bit
of a rough patch,

255
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:31,628
so I wanted to do
something to let her know

256
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,795
I was thinking
about her.

257
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:34,080
What's going on
with them?

258
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:35,014
They're just having

259
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:36,549
a little trouble
communicating.

260
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:38,718
My dad says it's because
the sound of my mom's voice

261
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,053
makes him want
to tear his ears off

262
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:41,120
and sew them
over his eyes

263
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:42,639
so he never has
to look at her again.

264
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:45,958
Hi.

265
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,010
Hey, guys.
Hello.

266
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:48,277
Look who's here to put

267
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,564
the "Jew" in "Jewelry Night"!

268
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:56,185
Oh, sure, so it's fine
when you say it.

269
00:11:57,271 --> 00:11:58,237
Sorry we're late.

270
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,605
I wanted to swing by the lab

271
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:02,258
and pick up some even
cooler tools for us to use.

272
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,160
- I didn't know you were coming again.
- Well, last week

273
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:05,361
was a blast.

274
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:08,581
Plus, I thought you might like
having a guy here.

275
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:13,419
It was not funny.

276
00:12:14,204 --> 00:12:16,089
So, what tools did you bring?

277
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:17,590
Everything we need
to make jewelry molds.

278
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:19,359
Here's some silver,
a crucible

279
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,377
and an acetylene torch
to melt it down.

280
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,329
Ooh, that looks like fun.

281
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:24,830
Maybe you should
master glue

282
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:27,800
before you move
on to fire.

283
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:29,218
Okay, who's up first?

284
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,437
Rajesh, do you want to make
a bracelet for your mom

285
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:32,555
to go with the necklace?

286
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:34,057
No, thanks.

287
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:35,692
I was gonna make
a necklace for my mom,

288
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:38,111
but unfortunately,
she doesn't have a neck.

289
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,015
She's just chins
and fat and feet.

290
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:49,205
Okay, we're almost ready to go.

291
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:51,541
Once we bond the wires,
we can test the tubes.

292
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:54,827
This is so exciting,
I-I feel...

293
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:57,580
like I'm 75 again.

294
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:02,701
Oh, God.

295
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:04,053
What... what is it?

296
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:05,221
Sheldon just sent me a picture

297
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:07,190
of him and Bill Nye
getting smoothies.

298
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:12,378
Can-can I ask you
a question?

299
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,479
Yeah, sure.

300
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:16,165
W-Why do you put up
with Sheldon?

301
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:20,069
Oh, uh, you know,
because we're friends.

302
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:24,273
Why?

303
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:27,276
Wow, you ask really
hard questions.

304
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:28,561
Yeah.

305
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:31,114
Look, I-I know
he can be aggravating,

306
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:32,698
but what you have
to remember is that

307
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,167
he's not doing it
on purpose.

308
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:35,535
It's just how he is.

309
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:38,721
But he's also loyal
and trustworthy

310
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:40,256
and we have fun together...

311
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:43,793
You... you know
you're describing a dog.

312
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:47,096
He did bite me once.

313
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:49,966
But in his defense,

314
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,301
I came up behind him
while he was eating, so...

315
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:54,520
Yeah, they-they hate that.

316
00:13:56,774 --> 00:14:00,393
You know what, Sheldon is the
smartest person I have ever met.

317
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:03,646
And he's a little broken
and he needs me.

318
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:07,116
I guess I need him, too.

319
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:08,701
Why-why is that?

320
00:14:08,703 --> 00:14:11,454
Boy, you will not
let this go, will you?

321
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,608
Oh, geez.

322
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,326
Another photo from Sheldon?

323
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:19,045
No, I have to go
pick him up.

324
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:22,215
Bill Nye ditched him
at the smoothie place.

325
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,285
He probably stole
his wallet, too.

326
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:31,641
You know, if you guys
are interested,

327
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:33,776
there's a technique where
I can take a lock of your hair,

328
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:35,561
refine it into carbon dust,

329
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:37,096
and use the hydraulic
press at work

330
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:38,848
to turn it into
a tiny little diamond

331
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,433
with your
DNA in it.

332
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:42,135
Oh, that's amazing!

333
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:43,653
Yeah. See Bernie's
engagement ring?

334
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:46,155
That came right off
my mom's back.

335
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:48,007
He's kidding.

336
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:50,910
If that were true,
it'd be so much bigger.

337
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,247
"My name is Howard.

338
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:55,481
"I can make your hair
into diamonds.

339
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:57,083
"My mom is morbidly obese.

340
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:59,418
Everybody love me."

341
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,221
Whoa, where is that coming from?

342
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:03,623
I'll tell you
where it's coming from.

343
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,259
All you do is make fun of me
for coming to girls' night

344
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:08,044
and now you're here
ruining it for everyone.

345
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,328
Raj, cool it...

346
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,048
he's gonna make us
hair diamonds.

347
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,383
How am I ruining anything?

348
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:16,152
I'm just trying to help you
make better jewelry.

349
00:15:16,154 --> 00:15:18,304
But this isn't
about the jewelry.

350
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:19,689
This is about me having a place

351
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:21,724
where I can open up
about my feelings.

352
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:25,061
Since when can't you
open up with me?

353
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:26,612
There are just some things

354
00:15:26,614 --> 00:15:28,731
that I feel more comfortable
sharing with the girls,

355
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,299
because they won't
make fun of me

356
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,118
or and call me names,
or ask me if my

357
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,570
"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

358
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,676
Buddy, I was just
joking around.

359
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,578
Yeah, well, sometimes
your jokes hurt.

360
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:45,214
Well, you're right.

361
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:46,465
I didn't realize

362
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:48,134
I was making you
feel that way.

363
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,354
It was very brave
of you to tell me.

364
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:53,306
Thank you.

365
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:54,807
It wasn't easy.

366
00:15:57,077 --> 00:15:58,377
They're gonna
have sex

367
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:01,080
before Sheldon and
I do, I know it.

368
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:06,736
Arthur.

369
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,053
Hi, Sheldon.

370
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:09,906
I'm surprised
to see you here.

371
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:11,657
Yeah, me, too.

372
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,743
Somewhere around
the third floor,

373
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:17,229
I began to see
a white light.

374
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:20,499
I'll get Leonard.

375
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,218
No, no,
no, I'm...

376
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,120
I'm here...
I'm here to see you.

377
00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:26,255
If you're hoping to get
in touch with Bill Nye,

378
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:28,207
I can't help you.

379
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:29,508
I've been informed
that he's now

380
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,745
Bill Nye
the Restraining Order Guy.

381
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:35,214
No, I'm...

382
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:38,217
I-I was thinking,
if it isn't too much trouble,

383
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:41,470
I'd like to get your opinion
about my-my paper.

384
00:16:41,472 --> 00:16:43,439
Thank you.

385
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:44,690
It would be an honor.

386
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,475
Oh. Uh, great.

387
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:48,144
Well, actually,
I don't need that.

388
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:50,730
I hacked into your e-mail
account and read it.

389
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:54,567
And... what did you think?

390
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:57,119
Well, first,
I think the fact that

391
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:59,322
you use your birthday
as a password

392
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:01,741
is embarrassing.

393
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:03,909
Mmm. Thank you.

394
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:07,413
Second, um...

395
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:09,966
I thought your
paper was inspired.

396
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:13,452
Oh, well, that...
that means a lot to me.

397
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:15,638
Can I invite you
in for tea?

398
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Uh, no, no.
I-I really...

399
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:19,124
I have...
I have to run.

400
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:20,476
Hey, Arthur.
How are you?

401
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:22,628
Well, I guess one cup
wouldn't hurt.

402
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:32,571
Oh, hey, buddy,
what's up?

403
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:33,972
Well, I was
feeling bad

404
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:35,675
about how I acted
the other night

405
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:37,643
so I made you
a little something.

406
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:39,362
You didn't have
to do that.

407
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:40,329
Well, it was fun.

408
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:41,664
I used some of
the jewelry techniques

409
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,832
you taught us.

410
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:48,587
It's a lightsaber
belt buckle.

411
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,989
Wow, this
is so cool,

412
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:53,676
Thanks.
Oh gets better.

413
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,347
Wow!

414
00:17:58,349 --> 00:17:59,665
And that's not even
the best part.

415
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,166
See?

416
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:03,552
I have one, too.

417
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:06,505
Check it out.

418
00:18:06,507 --> 00:18:08,808
You can wear yours
and we can have little sword fights

419
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,676
whenever we want.

420
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:30,536
Yeah, and my eighth favorite
episode of Professor Proton

421
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:31,871
was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."

422
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:33,155
You said,
"Plop, plop,

423
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:34,740
"fizz, fizz,

424
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:37,043
oh, what a blast-off it is."

425
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:39,295
Remember? Remember that?

426
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:40,496
Remember?

427
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:42,999
He can't help it.
He can't.

428
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,333
He really can't.
Oh!

429
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:45,718
Wait here.

430
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,669
I'll get some Alka-Seltzer,

431
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:47,837
we can build that rocket,

432
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,722
and we can shoot it
at Bill Nye's house.

433
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,309
As long as I'm not within
500 feet of it.

434
00:18:58,465 --> 00:18:59,899
So, you, uh...

435
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:02,568
you have...
you have any...

436
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,654
single grandmothers?

437
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:08,241
Sorry, they're both married.

438
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:12,228
Good.
Mmm.

439
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,363
H-Happily?
