00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:02,718
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,506
Make yourself a drink, Detective.

3
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:05,816
No more drinks.

4
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:07,252
No more blurred lines.

5
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:08,925
No more trying to sleep with me.

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,902
And you... are naked.

7
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:13,105
This is beyond inappropriate.

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,531
What do you think I'm insecure about?

9
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:16,318
That you are changing.

10
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:19,188
But that you don't know what's
causing the change. Or who.

11
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:21,850
Something has fundamentally
changed in Lucifer.

12
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:24,130
We can get him back to where he belongs

13
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:26,839
if you could just provide
me with a weak spot.

14
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:28,027
Are you sleeping with this idiot?

15
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:30,153
She hasn't had the
pleasure, unfortunately, no.

16
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:31,852
- Hey, Dan, I...
- Really, Chloe?

17
00:00:31,887 --> 00:00:33,153
I'm disappointed in you.

18
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,358
How could you possibly help me?

19
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:37,639
I have the ability to draw
out people's forbidden desires.

20
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:38,974
And desire is, like, your superpower.

21
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,496
It's more like a gift from God, really.

22
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,524
What are you?

23
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,212
I've been trying to
tell you. I'm the Devil.

24
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:45,182
Just shoot me, Detective, please.

25
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:47,583
Because maybe you'll finally realize...

26
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,482
Son of a bitch, that really hurts.

27
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,487
<i>She shot me, and I bled.</i>

28
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:52,375
That's not possible.

29
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,365
Well, don't think about
it too much; it's exciting.

30
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,553
The fun's just begun.

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,478
I very much approve of Benny's
avant-garde approach to clothing.

32
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:42,953
The models don't appear to be wearing any.

33
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:45,087
The Benny Choi brand isn't about clothes.

34
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:46,597
It's the shoes.

35
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:49,240
These guys kill for limited-edition kicks.

36
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,113
Six G's a pair.

37
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:54,307
Oh, even the Mistress
of Excess is impressed.

38
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:56,284
Go, Benny.

39
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,586
Oh, hello.

40
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:01,657
Mmm, dangerous.

41
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,136
Lucifer likes.

42
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:04,980
You were shot and you bled.

43
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:07,222
No sharp objects until we find out why.

44
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,797
Oh, quite the opposite.

45
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,663
The danger of getting
hurt's positively thrilling.

46
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:16,256
Fun with mortality.

47
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,740
Bring it.

48
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,787
Excuse me.

49
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,834
Since when does the Devil
care about mortality?

50
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:24,179
Great show, Benny.

51
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:29,835
Ladies and gentlemen, Benny Choi!

52
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,509
Now, come on, gorgeous, you tell
me your most dangerous desire.

53
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,920
Cheeseburger.

54
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:43,399
Cheeseburger? Really?

55
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:51,172
Benny, get down!

56
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:52,741
What was that?

57
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:00,610
It's a bit early for last call.

58
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:02,502
Never mind.

59
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,832
You need to leave. Now.

60
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,796
What's the rush? It's
just getting exciting.

61
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:10,359
Humans are playing with their guns,
and now they're running for cover.

62
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,435
No reason to find out if
your bones will break too.

63
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,396
Well, what about my broken... heart?

64
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:15,731
Move!

65
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:20,033
Get down! Get down!

66
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:30,580
Move, move! Y'all got to move!

67
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:32,281
Come on! Let's go!

68
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:37,191
People really do kill for Benny's shoes.

69
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:39,232
- We need to get out of here now.
- Why?

70
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:40,923
I just found my danger.

71
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:49,976
She snuck out of the house.

72
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:53,013
I thought she was asleep.

73
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,772
Mrs. Cortez, I'll find who
caused your daughter's death.

74
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:58,619
I promise you.

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,249
You okay?

76
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,052
Her only child was trampled to death,

77
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,864
after some thug fired into a crowd.

78
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:08,099
I've been better.

79
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:13,361
Gang Unit's piggybacking Homicide till we
can figure out who wanted Benny Choi dead.

80
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:14,522
Is he talking?

81
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:17,030
Clammed up as soon as we
got to the crime scene.

82
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,366
Okay.

83
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,396
It could get bloody.

84
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,431
You should probably stay as
safe as possible on this one.

85
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:25,229
Oh, yeah? Stick to the nice girly murders?

86
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,202
It just seems that
every time I turn around,

87
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:30,917
you're in another shootout with
your buddy Lucifer by your side.

88
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:32,307
Not an issue.

89
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:34,684
He was just, I don't know,

90
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:37,143
uh, some mystery that I wanted solved.

91
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,814
I could think of a few other choice names.

92
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:40,328
Yeah, how about complete wack job?

93
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,476
Don't worry, Lucifer Morningstar
is completely out of my life.

94
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:44,265
Right.

95
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,721
Get this one tighter.

96
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:48,741
- Tighter?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,444
Really, Officer?

98
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,036
And he's sitting on my desk.

99
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,381
Get out of that one.

100
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,299
Please tell me I'm hallucinating.

101
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,511
Well, I am dreamy, but
try to contain yourself.

102
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:00,626
What are you doing here?

103
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:01,746
I'm not actually here to see you.

104
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,340
I've come to talk to your boss.

105
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,102
About a shooting.

106
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:07,631
Okay, I thought you had my back on this.

107
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,126
If the department finds out what
really happened, I could lose my badge.

108
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:12,534
What, you mean the fact
that you shot me on purpose?

109
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,989
I told you I was sorry about that.

110
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:20,156
And I feel badly, I do. But it was a graze.

111
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:21,746
I doubt it even left a scar.

112
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,366
Didn't it?

113
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,819
Mr. Morningstar?

114
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:28,165
- I can see you now.
- Splendid!

115
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,728
Splendid. We've so much to discuss.

116
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,463
Ooh.

117
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:41,018
So what can I do for you?

118
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:42,111
Well, Lieutenant,

119
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:45,692
as you know, I was witness to
that grizzly death at Benny's.

120
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:46,987
I mean, only a matter of time

121
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:48,904
before those gentlemen
start pointing fingers

122
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,782
and the whole... the whole thing explodes.

123
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,467
- And?
- I want in.

124
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:54,511
- In?
- On the action.

125
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:56,793
I got a taste of danger, and I want more.

126
00:05:56,828 --> 00:06:00,067
This case is the perfect method
for me to explore my mortality

127
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,828
in an exciting and dangerous way.

128
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:07,936
And... help find out who's responsible
for that poor girl's death, of course.

129
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:10,572
I realize you've been very
helpful to Detective Decker

130
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,657
on her last couple of cases, but...

131
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:15,904
exploring mortality is
not really what I do here.

132
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,227
- No?
- Uh-uh.

133
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,935
It's funny, 'cause you're
an ambitious one, aren't you?

134
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,705
I can tell.

135
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,307
Brimming with desire.

136
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:30,938
If I'm gonna be the first
female chief of police,

137
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,881
I need a big close.

138
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,197
Of course you do. Of course you do.

139
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:37,434
And how do you plan on
achieving this grand goal?

140
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:41,036
I will never be appointed without the
support of the minority communities.

141
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:42,563
Right, yes.

142
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:44,230
Well, I tell you what.

143
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:46,624
If you allow me to assist on this case,

144
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:49,073
and... possibly others,

145
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:53,244
I'll deliver you all
the support you need, eh?

146
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,452
Just consider it a favor.

147
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:58,554
From a friend.

148
00:06:58,955 --> 00:06:59,812
After you.

149
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,057
Thank you so much.

150
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:03,623
Olivia, I can explain.

151
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:06,026
Oh, you better explain
why you have been keeping

152
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:09,798
such a valuable resource all to yourself.

153
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,300
Excuse me?

154
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:13,447
We have someone who can
make Benny Choi talk.

155
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:14,670
Someone with charm,

156
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:17,613
- likability...
- And has real ties to the community.

157
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:18,236
Here it comes.

158
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,076
Lucifer Morningstar has volunteered

159
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:23,313
to act as liaison in the Paola Cortez case.

160
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:27,031
You're welcome, Decker.

161
00:07:29,777 --> 00:07:31,244
Steady on.

162
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:38,342
That wack job's gonna
totally get me killed.

<i>What could you have possibly said</i>

165
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:57,980
to con your way onto another case?

166
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,065
Well, I simply offered
the lieutenant a favor.

167
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,912
She gets what she wants,
and I get what I want...

168
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,739
a nice juicy gang war.

169
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:06,210
You mean you offered to help
<i>prevent</i> a gang war, right?

170
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:07,273
Tomato,
tom-ah-to.

171
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:09,220
But, see, that's why we
make such great partners.

172
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,592
The "he said, she said" of it all.

173
00:08:10,627 --> 00:08:12,417
The yin-yang, the fireworks.

174
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,349
Partners?

175
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:14,465
More like glorified ride-along.

176
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,215
Just think, you and me,
close proximity at all times.

177
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,657
Yeah, in L.A., we call that "stalking."

178
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:19,975
It's wonderful, isn't it?

179
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,666
Uh, when do I get my own gun?

180
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,646
I wouldn't trust you
with my kid's lightsaber.

181
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:24,856
- And when do I get...
- I'll never let you drive.

182
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,188
If I'm gonna be forced to work
with you again, I call the shots.

183
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,459
You most certainly do.

184
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:29,777
Right in the leg.

185
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:31,749
I only shot you because you told me to.

186
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:34,893
In a moment of weakness, I
somehow fell for your hocus-pocus

187
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:37,761
and believed that you
actually might be the Devil.

188
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:39,424
I <i>am</i> the Devil.

189
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:41,649
Historically invincible, until now,

190
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:43,236
and that's what makes
this case so exciting...

191
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,609
real danger.

192
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:47,890
It's the perfect opportunity to see
what other mortal qualities I have.

193
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,539
Okay, I get it... you
want to feel new things.

194
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:54,159
Exactly.

195
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,930
- How's that?
- Bloody hell!

196
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:57,055
That hurt!

197
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,185
Do it again.

198
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:01,926
So where to, eh?

199
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:03,490
Stakeout, ambush?

200
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:04,890
You know, I'm quite skilled at restraints.

201
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,197
No, I'm taking you home.

202
00:09:06,257 --> 00:09:07,299
Ooh, how did you know?

203
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:08,516
That I'd last about ten minutes with you?

204
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,654
I don't know, call it a gut feeling.

205
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,004
Well, it's a successful one.

206
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,704
We'll be right on time.

207
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:14,726
Time? For what?

208
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:16,204
Lucifer, my man!

209
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:18,373
Benny!

210
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:19,474
Nice to see you.

211
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,814
So you're friends with Benny
Choi and his blinged-out pet pig.

212
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:23,835
- Of course you are.
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,472
His name is Pig Diddy.

214
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:27,728
This is my assistant Hector.

215
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:28,448
Ooh.

216
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,347
Someone love his mommy?

217
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,473
Ex-Marine, bitch.

218
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:33,026
Right.

219
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,061
Yes, Benny and I go back to the
start of his very impressive career.

220
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:38,278
Huh, let me guess, you did him a favor.

221
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:40,262
Lucifer helped me get my first show.

222
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:41,792
He was a real inspiration.

223
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:43,676
I try to reflect that in my art.

224
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:45,807
Any idea who took a shot at you?

225
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:46,675
Nope.

226
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,303
No recent threats, nothing?

227
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,797
Look, I'm no snitch.

228
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:53,517
Even if I did know, I can't talk.

229
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,446
I'm an artist.

230
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,282
I process tragedy through my work.

231
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,804
Would you prefer to process
tragedy back at the precinct?

232
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,537
'Cause I have a holding cell that
could really use an artist's touch.

233
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,355
Yes, Benny, that favor you owe me,

234
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,624
I'm calling in my IOU.

235
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:08,604
Answer the detective's questions.

236
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:13,732
Hector clashed with some punks
in Latin Kings colors that night.

237
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:15,928
We were at capacity, they wanted in.

238
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:18,131
They were making threats, they were upset.

239
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,991
And you didn't mention this
at the crime scene because...?

240
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:25,006
My fans aren't just buying shoes.

241
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,583
They're buying Benny Choi.

242
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:29,448
Artist, activist, man of the people.

243
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:30,849
You know, I wore colors back in the day.

244
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:32,441
Asian Boyz. I was low level.

245
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:33,556
You know, a punk.

246
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,081
Got out before the cops even knew my name.

247
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:37,010
Ah, protecting your rep.

248
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:39,583
Wouldn't want to risk that
seven-figure endorsement deal, would we?

249
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:41,384
I didn't talk because if a Latin King hears

250
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:44,583
an ex-Asian Boy done
dry-snitched him to the cops?

251
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:47,349
Those thugs will retaliate on principal.

252
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:48,739
I was trying to prevent more death.

253
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,928
Well, aren't we the little saint?

254
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:52,404
Latin Kings versus Asian Boyz.

255
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:53,712
That really narrows it down.

256
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:55,551
Did you get names?

257
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,303
Diego, Dani, I don't know.

258
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:01,637
A couple, I think.

259
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:02,814
Joined at the hip.

260
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:04,170
Mm-hmm.

261
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,596
Diego and Dani. Right.

262
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:09,466
You need to call me if
you remember anything else.

263
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:13,677
Uh, yeah, I'll call.

264
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:15,112
But be careful.

265
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:17,073
Them Latin Kings about to raise hell.

266
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,641
My "speciality."

267
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:23,969
Did it ever occur to you to tell
me that you're tight with Benny?

268
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:26,353
That you gave one of your
favors to a former gang felon?

269
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:28,506
Well, I've been giving
favors for thousands of years.

270
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,753
Would you like a peek at my ledger?

271
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:31,584
No, I'd like you to follow basic protocol.

272
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,386
And I'd love to continue the debate
on our opposing views of police work,

273
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:35,539
so how about we hit the cop bar,

274
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:37,513
and get dangerous with
some bottom shelf, huh?

275
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,282
A girl's dead and you
want to go on a pub crawl.

276
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:40,570
Oh, liquid courage.

277
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:43,638
I hear the Paddock Lounge is every
new detective's rite of passage.

278
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:46,074
Forget it. We need to wait
for an I.D. on those kids.

279
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:48,994
150,000 active gang members in L.A.,

280
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:49,820
it could take awhile.

281
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:52,704
Oh, you're right. No time
for a quick drink, then.

282
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,778
We're on duty.

283
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,938
You are the oldest young
person I've ever met!

284
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,987
And coming from an immortal,
that's saying something.

285
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:04,177
Look, I'm not gonna drink at
a bar where everyone hates me.

286
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:07,361
Did you ever consider they
hate you for that very reason?

287
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:08,947
Yeah, they hate me for several reasons.

288
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:11,314
Well, don't let those
Philistines inhibit your right

289
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:14,113
to toast our first break
in the case... come on!

290
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:15,032
It's the least you could do.

291
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,888
Besides, you know, I...

292
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:19,046
need something to dull the pain.

293
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:22,007
Ugh! If I say yes, will
you shut up about the leg?

294
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,638
No promises.

295
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:26,665
Ooh! Aah!

296
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,270
Here comes that bitch Decker.

297
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:37,392
Who's the hell's that guy?

298
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:38,610
Want me to lose this guy?

299
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,637
It's Italian wool.

300
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,833
Touch it. I know you want to.

301
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:48,687
Go on.

302
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:52,644
Yeah. That'll do.

303
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,915
Well, somebody's not being
crowned homecoming queen, are they?

304
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,526
Yeah. Order. Please.

305
00:12:58,561 --> 00:12:59,578
Right.

306
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,070
Uh, two shots of your
finest swill, please, love.

307
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:04,902
- You got it.
- I'll have a water.

308
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,706
So, about this whole favor thing.

309
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,554
What... what is it?

310
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,545
What are you, some kind of loan shark?

311
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,816
Con man? Godfather with a twist?

312
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:16,581
But surely you've heard the expression...

313
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,266
"Deal with the Devil"?

314
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:19,951
- Mm!
- Come on, give me a break.

315
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:21,396
No, people come to me to ask for favors,

316
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:23,652
and more often than
not, I'm happy to oblige.

317
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:24,711
What do <i>you</i> get?

318
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:26,582
Well, sometimes, I have something in mind,

319
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:27,737
but, usually, like with Benny,

320
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:30,528
it's simply to be repaid at a later date.

321
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:32,893
A devilish IOU, if you will.

322
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:35,020
Who would take a deal like that?

323
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,264
They <i>all</i> do.

324
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,080
Palmetto Bitch.

325
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:47,925
Ooh! Juicy! Do tell.

326
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,256
That's Anthony Paolucci.

327
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,171
He's partners with the guy who took
a bullet in the Palmetto case...

328
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:55,956
Malcolm Graham.

329
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,784
Ah, yes, the infamous Palmetto.

330
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,769
Malcolm got shot meeting
with some gangsters,

331
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,528
and... Paolucci thinks he took the bullet

332
00:14:03,563 --> 00:14:06,406
like a hero; I think he was on the take.

333
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,970
Aha! So you're a snitch.

334
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:11,624
A nog. No wonder nobody likes you.

335
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,178
Yeah, you'd think I was guilty of a crime.

336
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,541
Yeah, you know what they say:
"Snitches end up in ditches."

337
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:16,937
Oh, thanks, man.

338
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,305
I feel so much better.

339
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,208
Hm!

340
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:20,800
No, I don't know, I just...

341
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:22,965
was following my gut, I guess.

342
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,950
Caught in the crosshairs
of another man's crime.

343
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:26,767
I don't need your sympathy, but thank you.

344
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:27,601
Fair enough.

345
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:29,888
Still, no excuse for that man's rudeness.

346
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:31,331
No, no, no, no... I can handle Paolucci.

347
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:32,924
I don't need you to stand up for me.

348
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,492
Understood.

349
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:38,217
Excuse me.

350
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:39,883
Hello.

351
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,023
- What do you want?
- Well, firstly,

352
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:42,152
let me state that I'm in no way

353
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:44,780
standing up for my
associate, Detective Decker.

354
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:47,305
But on behalf of myself, and only myself,

355
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,474
I think you're a complete sack of ass.

356
00:14:52,211 --> 00:14:54,746
Are you crazy? Let's get out of here.

357
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:03,417
And your name?

358
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,256
Mazikeen.

359
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:08,004
How do you spell that?

360
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,121
Surprise me.

361
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:14,468
Interesting choice of venue.

362
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,689
What, are you trying
to throw me off-balance?

363
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:20,251
Because I'm much more comfortable
among humans than you might think.

364
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:22,944
So I see.

365
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:29,299
This is my favorite place in the city.

366
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:30,282
Really?

367
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:31,803
Look at them on their laptops,

368
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,862
writing the next great screenplay,

369
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:36,373
torturing themselves with dreams they know,

370
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:39,910
deep down, they will never achieve.

371
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,828
Reminds me of home.

372
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:44,671
Get to the point.

373
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,096
I want to go back.

374
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:50,692
Then give me something, Maze.

375
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:52,749
Give me something that I
can use against Lucifer,

376
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,609
and I'll make sure you're
both back where you belong.

377
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:55,874
That's the problem.

378
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:58,283
He doesn't confide in me anymore.

379
00:15:58,841 --> 00:15:59,874
But...

380
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,237
there is someone he
does talk to... a doctor.

381
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:08,248
And I bet she would love
that ridiculous suit.

382
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:11,482
And here I thought you
were the loyal soldier.

383
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,170
I want what's best for Lucifer.

384
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:16,848
Same thing you want.

385
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,590
Then tell me about this doctor...

386
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:24,054
..."Mike."

387
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,350
Hello?

388
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:46,150
Is anybody there?

389
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:54,597
I know Krav Maga!

390
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,121
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

391
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:17,044
How did you get in here?

392
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,764
I have a key.

393
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:21,526
Yeah, let me start over.

394
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:24,859
Uh, I actually just moved
into the office next-door.

395
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,121
I'm Dr. Canaan.

396
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:28,920
Oh, okay.

397
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:30,733
Hi. Uh, I'm Linda.

398
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:33,139
Uh, Dr. Martin.

399
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:41,731
It's fantastic, actually.

400
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,099
The thrill of fighting humans

401
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:46,002
has taken on a whole new spin,
now that I might get hurt.

402
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:49,805
Although, sadly, the only thing broken
was that incontinent troll's nose.

403
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:52,825
- Your behavior is foolish.
- Oh, come on!

404
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,855
You used to love danger.

405
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,966
Since when did Hell's favorite
torturer become my mother?

406
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:59,454
You're changing.

407
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:01,037
Becoming vulnerable.

408
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:03,597
Maybe even... mortal.

409
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,489
Mm!

410
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:10,010
If I'm not going to look
out for you, who will? Hmm?

411
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:12,106
- Your pet cop?
- That's what partners are for.

412
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:14,415
She is not your partner.

413
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:16,939
Have you two been talking?

414
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,698
You know, I actually don't think it's
my mortality that you're worried about.

415
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:28,883
You're just jealous that I'm
exploring it with Detective Decker.

416
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:33,860
Jealous of a mortal woman?

417
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,558
Mm-hmm.

418
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:37,219
I don't think so.

419
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:39,894
But if you insist on
continuing this exploration,

420
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:42,147
maybe next time, I won't
be around to save your ass.

421
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,526
Mm! Well, that <i>is</i> a shame.

422
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:46,074
'Cause you and my backside
used to get on very well.

423
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:48,067
My front side, as well, actually.

424
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:49,085
Things change, Lucifer.

425
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,811
Yes, but you don't, Maze.

426
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,781
You exist to protect me.

427
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:57,811
To know where I am and
who I'm with at all times,

428
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,369
whether you want to, or not.

429
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:13,304
Pretty sure your name's not on the list.

430
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:14,789
It should be.

431
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,734
Considering I've just spent
the last couple of hours

432
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:19,674
convincing Anthony Paolucci
not to press charges.

433
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,131
Well, what if I want to press charges?

434
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:24,011
- For what?
- Stupidity.

435
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:26,913
A drunk, on-duty cop...
surely that's a no-no.

436
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,724
But don't worry, I'm feeling charitable.

437
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:30,924
I'll let it slide this time.

438
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:34,433
Is it my thanks you want, or a kiss?

439
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:36,264
I don't want your thanks.

440
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,759
Because I don't do
favors for guys like you.

441
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,065
I did this for Chloe.

442
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,886
Oh, stop raining on
the poor woman's parade.

443
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,634
It's about time she got
some spark in her life.

444
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,683
Spark?

445
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,395
How about real danger?

446
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,131
Do you have any idea how easy a gang
vendetta can spiral out of control?

447
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:58,174
Well, I'm trying my best to find out. Yeah.

448
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,109
That's exactly why I'm here.

449
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,787
Chloe is the mother of
my child, you imbecile.

450
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:06,435
You want to work this case?

451
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,782
Take care of her.

452
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,764
Sir, yes, sir.

453
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:24,905
<i>Okay, Latin Kings turf.</i>

454
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,534
<i>You need to have my back on this.</i>

455
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:28,434
<i>You can count on me, Detective.</i>

456
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:30,945
All right, Dani and Diego Ramirez.

457
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,015
Married straight out
of juvie; real hotheads.

458
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,649
Ooh! Do we get to kick in the door?

459
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:37,451
As your self-sacrificing
partner, I volunteer to go first.

460
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,099
No, there'll be no kicking in of anything,

461
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:40,286
unless we have a warrant,

462
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,686
or people are in immediate danger.

463
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:44,912
You better start taking
this case seriously.

464
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:46,405
If this escalates to a gang war...

465
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,356
Yes, yes, it could spiral out of control...

466
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:50,507
blood could run in the
streets, fire could rain down.

467
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,663
You sound just like your ex.

468
00:20:53,237 --> 00:20:55,052
What do you mean... you spoke to Dan?

469
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:55,885
Mm!

470
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,383
He dropped by Lux.

471
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:59,231
Kept rambling on about keeping you safe.

472
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,521
Quite condescending, if you ask me.

473
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:03,502
What is it with the men in my life?

474
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:06,372
I'm a man in your life?

475
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:14,823
Uh, Detective, you seem to have
left on the central locking!

476
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,606
Act like a child, get treated like a child.

477
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:20,595
Wha...? Isn't it illegal to
leave your child locked in a car?

478
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:35,512
Diego and Dani Ramirez, LAPD.

479
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:37,494
Need to ask you a few questions.

480
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,357
LAPD! Open up!

481
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:45,061
Come on, baby.

482
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,231
Let me make you feel better.

483
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,096
Who the hell are you?!

484
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:03,864
What are you doing here?!

485
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:07,234
What are you doing in my house, man?!

486
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,429
How the hell did you get out of the car?

487
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:11,960
Child's play, and good thing I did.

488
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:13,685
There was immediate danger.

489
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,259
He was about to leave this
woman completely unsatisfied.

490
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,054
- What the...?!
- Hey! Hey!

491
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,907
- Down.
- He's your partner?

492
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:21,663
Yeah, don't get me started.

493
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:23,383
Cops harass us no matter what we do!

494
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:25,428
And now they're breaking into our house?!

495
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:26,757
I should sue that pervert!

496
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:27,742
You have my blessing.

497
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,315
But first, let's talk Benny Choi.

498
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,092
Yes, did you attempt to use him
as target practice the other night?

499
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:32,851
- That wasn't us!
- No.

500
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:35,373
Okay, well, witnesses said they
heard you making threats at the door.

501
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:37,150
No, we-we just wanted in.

502
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:38,740
We wanted a pair of Benny's sweet kicks.

503
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,432
Enough to pay for them
with Paola Cortez's blood?

504
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:43,400
Paola was Diego's cousin, okay?

505
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:45,154
It's wack what happened to her.

506
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:47,730
Why do you think he's so upset?

507
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:51,959
I promised I'd get her in the show.

508
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,529
There wasn't enough room for
three, so... we gave her our spot.

509
00:22:57,422 --> 00:22:58,904
She wanted to be a designer.

510
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:01,450
Sorry, is that, is that flop sweat

511
00:23:01,485 --> 00:23:02,489
or is that a tear?

512
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:05,041
That's... Oh...

513
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:06,187
Oh, bloody hell.

514
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,557
This is our bad guy?

515
00:23:07,592 --> 00:23:09,777
No wonder he can't get it up.

516
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:12,546
Look, uh...

517
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:14,034
if you didn't take a shot at Benny,

518
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:17,334
then help us get justice for Paola.

519
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:20,161
Tell us what you know, all right?

520
00:23:23,956 --> 00:23:27,090
If anyone had beef with
Benny Choi, it's Yellow Viper.

521
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,281
"Yellow Viper"?

522
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:29,996
Sounds like a venereal disease.

523
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:32,814
He got out of jail a few
nights before Benny's show.

524
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:35,342
He was a big-deal graffiti artist,
ran with Benny back in the day,

525
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,364
then took the fall on some B&E.

526
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,806
He got five and change, while
Benny got rich and famous.

527
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:43,953
Well, it does sound like this Viper
fellow has every reason to punish Benny.

528
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:45,595
We need to present a unified front.

529
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,363
Speculate later, not in front of them.

530
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:48,368
Got it.

531
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:51,450
So, Viper's beef killed
your cousin then, eh?

532
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:53,223
What? That wasn't speculation.

533
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:54,768
That was a statement of potential fact.

534
00:23:54,803 --> 00:23:55,972
And if we ever run into him,

535
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:57,789
he won't have to worry about no cops.

536
00:23:57,828 --> 00:23:59,753
So you're just gonna sit
around and wait for revenge?

537
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,014
That's rather lazy.

538
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:02,647
Okay, this is the opposite of helping.

539
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,251
What? I was promised a gang war.

540
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:06,386
Instead I get a cry baby. This is boring.

541
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:07,220
All right, tough.

542
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:10,090
Right now, we need to warn Benny
that his buddy Viper's back in town.

543
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,890
My apologies for him.

544
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:17,830
Thanks ever so.

545
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:19,771
Ooh, let me guess.

546
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:22,269
Anemic sext from Sir Douche?

547
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,237
No, from Benny.

548
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:26,838
Someone else is dead.

549
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:29,570
Ooh, less boring!

550
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:37,686
Benny?

551
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:39,470
Some street artist.

552
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:40,454
Oh, dear.

553
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,861
Crazy guess: That's not paint.

554
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,954
Mm.

555
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:48,968
Definitely blood, though.

556
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:51,064
But curiously, not human.

557
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,335
Benny?

558
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:57,229
Poor Diddy.

559
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:02,288
This is the murder?

560
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:04,568
I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to call.

561
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,572
Ain't no 911 for pets.

562
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:08,912
Bacon for dinner, I guess.

563
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:13,130
And my deepest condolences, Benny.

564
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:14,761
What happened?

565
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:17,020
Hector and I went to an opening.

566
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,192
Came back to find...

567
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:20,894
it's Pig Diddy.

568
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,889
Were you aware that your
old friend Yellow Viper

569
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:24,965
was released from prison last week?

570
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:26,757
No, I had no idea he was out.

571
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,119
No phone calls? No contact?

572
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,338
I sent him letters when
he was inside San Quentin.

573
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,251
Money for lawyers, too.

574
00:25:33,318 --> 00:25:34,963
But he sent the letters back all torn up.

575
00:25:34,998 --> 00:25:36,525
Didn't take a dime.

576
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:39,011
I always felt bad for
how things turned out.

577
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:40,397
How I got lucky.

578
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:42,028
Viper went down.

579
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:42,918
He was my best friend...

580
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:45,470
Well, with friends like
that, I'd hide the knives.

581
00:25:45,505 --> 00:25:47,183
Yeah, Viper must've snuck into my show.

582
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:48,927
He fired those shots.

583
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:51,201
Killing Pig Diddy was a message.

584
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:54,248
All right, we'll get a squad
car to watch your house tonight.

585
00:25:54,283 --> 00:25:55,683
Viper comes by, you'll be safe.

586
00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:57,411
Aw, y'all don't know him like I do.

587
00:25:57,446 --> 00:26:00,536
He's fierce. He won't stop
till it's my blood on the floor.

588
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,761
Thanks, Benny.

589
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:09,315
You know, they really don't
make bad guys like they used to.

590
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,211
We need to get word to
Viper's parole officer.

591
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:12,974
Track him down before he can get to Benny.

592
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,181
Finally, some real action.

593
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:18,118
I'm more than ready to face the
danger of the notorious Yellow Viper.

594
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:26,562
Oh!

595
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,625
Hello there, neighbor.

596
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,201
Is everything okay?

597
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:33,440
I was just wondering if you
would care to grab a drink?

598
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:35,304
- Oh?
- Yes.

599
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:38,205
I actually need someone to confide in.

600
00:26:38,448 --> 00:26:40,007
"Confide in"?

601
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:43,404
About a patient; a troubling one.

602
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,411
Oh, oh.

603
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:47,541
So, a-a doctor, a
doctor-to-doctor thing.

604
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,415
Exactly.

605
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:52,548
And, hey, listen, if you have any
patients you need to talk about...

606
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,749
You have no idea.

607
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:56,792
Good, so it's settled then.

608
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:59,060
You share with me, I share with you.

609
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:01,205
A fluid exchange.

610
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,574
Maybe one drink.

611
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,077
<i>I mean, seriously,</i>

612
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:10,963
a community center?

613
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:13,774
This is where we'll find
the deadly Yellow Viper?

614
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:14,967
According to his parole officer.

615
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,745
Oh, after five years behind
bars, a brothel would be my go-to.

616
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,584
You know, I've been thinking about
that favor that you gave Benny.

617
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,154
Did it also involve getting
him off on the felony B&E charge

618
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:27,762
that put Viper in prison instead?

619
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:30,357
Well, I may have pulled
a few strings... why?

620
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:31,673
Well, if Viper hadn't have gone to prison,

621
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:33,760
he wouldn't have targeted
Benny and shot up his show,

622
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:35,802
which means Paola Cortez
would still be alive.

623
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:38,423
Wait, you're not seriously
blaming me for that girl's death?

624
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:39,274
Just stating fact.

625
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:40,701
Cause and effect; intended or not.

626
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:42,035
No, no. I-I can't be held responsible

627
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,962
for what happens after
I give someone a favor.

628
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,540
I mean, if there's one
thing the Devil knows,

629
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:48,242
it's that people need
to take responsibility

630
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:49,830
for their own bad behavior.

631
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:54,252
Yes, people do need to take
responsibility for their own bad behavior.

632
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:57,058
I just said that.

633
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:59,295
Are you hearing impaired?

634
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:09,844
Remember...

635
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:13,365
tagging means nothing if it
doesn't come from right here.

636
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,901
Hmm.

637
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:17,378
Yellow Viper, I presume.

638
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:19,735
He's teaching art to youngsters.

639
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,627
I mean, this bad guy thing's
gonna be all the joke now.

640
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:23,277
What next... cuddles and ice cream?

641
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:36,030
Private class.

642
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,294
I'm Detective Decker.

643
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,812
This is... Never mind.

644
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:41,984
I need to ask you a few questions about
the shooting at Benny's fashion show.

645
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:43,956
You got a warrant?

646
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:45,893
If not...

647
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:46,867
beat it.

648
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:48,124
I'm not talking to cops.

649
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,470
Ooh, do you have something
to hide, Mr. Viper?

650
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:52,663
Or do you go by Yellow?

651
00:28:52,737 --> 00:28:56,682
Oh, you think I'm gonna let you
bust my balls in front of these kids?

652
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:00,377
Arrest me or step off.

653
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:04,660
Ooh, charming.

654
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:06,422
- Is everything okay?
- Well, he's right.

655
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:07,799
He doesn't have to talk to us.

656
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,042
He really seems to care about those kids.

657
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:11,358
It's odd for a criminal.

658
00:29:11,393 --> 00:29:12,962
Or anyone, really.

659
00:29:12,997 --> 00:29:14,261
You know, if you spent as much time

660
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:16,458
appealing to suspects
as you do annoying me,

661
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:19,146
things might go...

662
00:29:19,263 --> 00:29:21,212
go a lot faster.

663
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:37,965
Our lucky day.

664
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,469
Viper and the perv.

665
00:29:39,504 --> 00:29:43,055
Bravo, crybaby. This is
a bold move, isn't it?

666
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,133
Come on, turn around.

667
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:47,115
If you walk away now, no
one has to get arrested.

668
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,178
No one has to get hurt...

669
00:29:48,213 --> 00:29:49,888
Yeah, they do. Viper killed my cousin.

670
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:52,166
- I'm here to get justice!
- As you should.

671
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,176
Are you insane? Shut up.

672
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,585
What?

673
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,374
Please, I promise we're dealing with this.

674
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:01,542
You and your perv partner want to get
caught in the crossfire, cop, be my guest.

675
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:04,707
Smoke this piece!

676
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:11,085
Enough danger for you yet?

677
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:12,545
Just stay there. Stay there.

678
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,351
I'm curious.

679
00:30:17,757 --> 00:30:18,856
Right.

680
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:28,207
This ain't about you, it's about Viper!

681
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,925
Hey, now if you'd just give
that gun I'd asked for...

682
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,848
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

683
00:30:33,772 --> 00:30:35,243
Diego?

684
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:38,092
Diego, put down your weapon.

685
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,769
Don't listen to her.

686
00:30:39,858 --> 00:30:40,763
This isn't what you want.

687
00:30:40,845 --> 00:30:43,545
Taking down Viper is exactly what he wants.

688
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,514
We're doing it for Paola! Step off!

689
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,271
I said step off!

690
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,704
You know, as the Master of Punishment,

691
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:52,055
I completely understand
your desire to make Viper pay

692
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,695
for the tragic death of your cousin...

693
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,898
Lucifer, you do remember
that bullets hurt, right?

694
00:30:56,012 --> 00:30:59,541
And furthermore, you do seem to
have this danger thing down pat,

695
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,546
don't you?

696
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:02,258
I mean the Devil could
learn a thing or two.

697
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,705
The Devil? The hell you talking about?

698
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,194
So, answer me this:

699
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:08,575
So, you engage in turf wars, yet
nobody actually owns any turf?

700
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:09,749
Get back, freak!

701
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,851
All right, let's finish this.

702
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:13,863
And-and those trousers. I
mean, you wear them so low that,

703
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:15,600
well, your ass is exposed
to other naughty men,

704
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:17,397
and we all know what kind
of danger that can bring,

705
00:31:17,432 --> 00:31:19,608
don't we? I mean, you can
park your bike in there.

706
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:21,230
You making fun of his pants, yo?

707
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:22,733
Well, are we talking pants or trousers?

708
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:24,930
Because it's very confusing.

709
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,511
Where'd he go?

710
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:30,721
- Oh, dear.
- Don't matter.

711
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,824
I'll kill you first.

712
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:36,078
Hey, what's happening?

713
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:38,746
Where's Viper?

714
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:41,554
You had your hero moment... stay
down, or you're gonna get shot!

715
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,323
Indeed!

716
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,357
What's that? What happened?

717
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:53,851
What the hell is happening?

718
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,101
Maze is happening.

719
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,227
Your bartender's a ninja?

720
00:32:00,262 --> 00:32:01,730
- Of course she is.
- Yeah.

721
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:03,572
What's that?

722
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:07,299
Shattered tibia.

723
00:32:07,948 --> 00:32:10,412
Ooh, ouch... orbital fracture.

724
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:15,664
It was first perfected
in the hellfires of Tyre.

725
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:20,222
Oh, the humerus crush!

726
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:23,189
Love that Maze!

727
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,047
Oh, bravo, Detective.

728
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:50,552
Ass saved.

729
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:51,553
You're welcome.

730
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:54,474
His ass, not yours.

731
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:10,848
Let's go.

732
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:19,715
Care to tell me what happened?

733
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,210
You wouldn't believe me if I did.

734
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:26,899
They found a gun in Viper's bag.

735
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:30,526
It's a .38. Same caliber
fired at Benny's show.

736
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:32,894
Um...

737
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,080
What?

738
00:33:34,214 --> 00:33:35,892
You should know something.

739
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:36,532
Okay.

740
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,433
I talked to Lucifer
about you the other day.

741
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:39,976
Yeah, I heard.

742
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:41,746
I mean, not that it got me anywhere.

743
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:45,082
If anyone can handle themselves
around that wack job, it's you.

744
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:47,743
And, hey, it looks like, uh...

745
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:49,894
you got the bad guy.

746
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,015
Yeah.

747
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,244
Looks like.

748
00:34:09,992 --> 00:34:11,800
What, no "thank you"?

749
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:13,637
I don't know why you're upset.

750
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:15,604
I helped save kids.

751
00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:16,838
And we arrested our shooter.

752
00:34:16,873 --> 00:34:18,364
One might say I did you a favor.

753
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,551
Hmm.

754
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:22,308
Yeah, I think I just figured
it out, why you do these favors.

755
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:24,324
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

756
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:25,675
It's about power.

757
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,120
It makes you feel superior.

758
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:28,429
In control.

759
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:30,897
You're addicted to creating chaos
and seeing where the chips fall,

760
00:34:30,932 --> 00:34:32,687
to hell with the consequences.

761
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:35,460
It's like you have some
kind of god complex.

762
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,537
I most certainly do not.

763
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:39,915
You do a favor for one
person, someone else suffers.

764
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,429
When you gave Benny that favor,

765
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:42,840
you damned Viper to prison.

766
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,056
Twice.

767
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,370
Whether he's guilty or not.

768
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,216
What?

769
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:07,157
Stop staring.

770
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:09,451
You're having another one of
those "gut feelings," aren't you?

771
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,498
Like you had on the Palmetto case.

772
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:13,234
This has nothing to do with Palmetto.

773
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:14,201
Au contraire.

774
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:15,818
I think it has everything to do with it.

775
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:18,102
See? Addicted to creating
chaos, talking out of your ass...

776
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:20,022
Like I said: you were
trusting your instincts

777
00:35:20,057 --> 00:35:22,936
on that case, just like
you're trusting them now.

778
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:27,943
I mean, why would a seasoned parolee
bring a gun to a children's art class?

779
00:35:27,978 --> 00:35:29,377
For all we know, Mr. Viper is innocent.

780
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:32,314
I am innocent, man!

781
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:33,289
See?

782
00:35:33,324 --> 00:35:35,114
What do you know? Our suspect has ears.

783
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:38,142
Let's see if he has a
conscience, as well, shall we?

784
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,354
Mr. Viper.

785
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,495
Mr. Viper...

786
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:43,492
Hello.

787
00:35:43,526 --> 00:35:46,358
You've already wasted so much of your life.

788
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:50,201
What do you desire to do with
the rest of your time on Earth?

789
00:35:50,979 --> 00:35:53,123
All I want to do is my art.

790
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:56,520
I swear I didn't shoot up Benny's show.

791
00:35:56,555 --> 00:36:00,972
If I hated him so much, why would
I bother to go after him and miss?

792
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,674
Oh.

793
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,936
Yes, he's got a point, actually.

794
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,525
I mean, to pop off in a crowd
like that and not hit anyone,

795
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,162
he'd have to be the
worst shot in the world.

796
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,510
Or the best.

797
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:18,225
Steady on, Detective.

798
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,222
It's my Pig Diddy piece.

799
00:36:27,257 --> 00:36:29,982
Collector in Dubai
offered me 150 G's for it.

800
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:31,457
I want you to have it.

801
00:36:31,492 --> 00:36:33,212
As thanks for saving my life.

802
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:34,083
Again.

803
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,528
Yes, my favor really did pay
off for you, didn't it, Benny?

804
00:36:38,606 --> 00:36:39,808
You're a huge star.

805
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:44,488
But if there's one thing the
Devil abhors, it's a fake.

806
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:46,119
What are you talking about?

807
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:47,508
I'm all about authenticity.

808
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,164
Sure. Except for the lying.

809
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:53,264
You failed to inform me that in
getting you off the B&E charge,

810
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:56,214
suspicion would immediately
fall on your best friend.

811
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:57,947
I had no control over that.

812
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,446
Didn't you?

813
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:01,398
Oh...

814
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:03,456
Hey, it's good to see you, man.

815
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:04,875
I missed you, bro.

816
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,827
That why you never came
to visit me in prison?

817
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:08,106
I wish I could've done more.

818
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:10,719
Framing him for shooting up your
fashion show surely didn't help.

819
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:11,973
Viper was always the real talent.

820
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:14,753
When you heard he was getting released,
you tried to take down the competition

821
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:16,366
before he could take down you.

822
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,269
Planned a simple frame job.

823
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:20,398
Parole violation that would
send Viper back to prison.

824
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:23,142
But when Paola Cortez died, you
had to improvise, didn't you?

825
00:37:23,177 --> 00:37:26,483
You knew pointing the fingers at Latin
Kings would eventually get back to me.

826
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:28,721
How the hell could I have
staged that frame job?

827
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:30,974
How could I have pointed a gun at myself?

828
00:37:31,075 --> 00:37:32,559
Because you didn't pull the trigger.

829
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:34,833
So many bullets fired into that crowd.

830
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:36,917
How did no one get hit?

831
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:38,269
That takes precision.

832
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:41,000
I saw your Marine tattoo
when I met you, Hector.

833
00:37:41,086 --> 00:37:43,548
A heart in crosshairs. Sniper unit.

834
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,997
Best marksmen in the world.

835
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:50,200
Did you know firing a gun
into a crowd is a felony?

836
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,055
You're responsible for Paola's murder.

837
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,493
Unless, of course, you were
just doing someone a favor.

838
00:37:55,613 --> 00:37:59,674
- No, man. Hey...
- Benny made me do it! I'll testify, man.

839
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:01,539
He told me he'd make me a partner.

840
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:05,221
But then he made me plant the gun on Viper.

841
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,414
And kill Pig Diddy.

842
00:38:10,148 --> 00:38:11,918
I loved that pig, man.

843
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:12,822
Oh...

844
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,020
Well, the good news is that
whilst all dogs go to Heaven,

845
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:19,781
you'd be surprised how many
pigs are waiting for you in Hell.

846
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:21,256
Okay, let's go.

847
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:22,360
You were never good as me, man.

848
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:23,533
You were never good as me, man!

849
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:24,456
- Never!
- What?

850
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,670
I don't think so, Sonny G.

851
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,138
Not my...

852
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,145
Mm.

853
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:38,705
I'm no expert on L.A.
street art, but it's funny...

854
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:41,948
this piece seems a lot
more authentic to me now.

855
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:50,118
I think I'll keep it.

856
00:38:57,176 --> 00:39:00,308
We're here live at the
location of the impromptu shrine

857
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:04,727
for Paola Cortez, the young art school
student killed at the fashion show

858
00:39:04,762 --> 00:39:06,842
for artist/designer Benny Choi,

859
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,456
who has been arrested for the killing.

860
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:10,430
Can we start, please? Excuse me.

861
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:11,583
Yes, ma'am.

862
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:12,916
Thank you.

863
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,152
The mother...

864
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:17,154
of Paola Cortez can rest
a little easier tonight,

865
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:21,124
knowing that her daughter's
killer is behind bars.

866
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,281
The arrest of Benny Choi and
several of the Latin Kings membership

867
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:27,867
is a reminder that my LAPD

868
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:30,622
means justice for all.

869
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:36,029
You know, I'd love to make
that woman cry for real.

870
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,170
She's gonna be chief of
police because of you.

871
00:39:38,205 --> 00:39:39,506
Mm.

872
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:40,951
I don't know how you do it.

873
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:42,861
I simply made good on a favor.

874
00:39:42,896 --> 00:39:44,788
- Aren't you the little saint?
- Oh, no, no.

875
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:47,221
This time, I called in my IOU.

876
00:39:47,293 --> 00:39:50,921
Olivia got what she wanted,
and I got what I wanted.

877
00:39:50,994 --> 00:39:52,780
Oh, don't say it. Come on, don't say it.

878
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:56,962
I am now an official civilian
consultant for the LAPD.

879
00:39:57,038 --> 00:39:59,262
- Oh.
- Not that there's anything civil

880
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,009
about the Devil.

881
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:01,856
What fun would that be?

882
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:04,965
Okay, then.

883
00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:06,167
You win.

884
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:07,297
We're partners.

885
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:09,005
What, you're not going to protest?

886
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,623
Actually, no.

887
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:13,094
I may have no idea what
your angle is, but...

888
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:15,587
at least now I can keep my eye on you.

889
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:16,915
Keep your enemies close, right?

890
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,259
Close?

891
00:40:18,294 --> 00:40:20,675
So does this mean you're gonna take me home

892
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,796
and consummate our new
arrangement, then, Detective?

893
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,483
Oh.

894
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:34,103
I'll take that as a yes.

895
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:42,364
Seriously?

896
00:40:42,494 --> 00:40:43,573
What, you're just gonna leave me here?

897
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,881
In this part of town?

898
00:40:44,996 --> 00:40:46,606
You said you wanted danger.

899
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:47,244
What...?

900
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:50,557
Detective! Detective!

901
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:54,807
I don't even have a phone!

902
00:40:56,168 --> 00:40:57,209
Ah, well.

903
00:40:57,244 --> 00:40:59,289
That's just marvelous, isn't it?

904
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:13,482
Humanity tested,

905
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:14,771
homicide solved,

906
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:16,872
gangbanger attire dissected...

907
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:19,551
Although, that one I
still have questions about.

908
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:20,844
Anyway, cheers.

909
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:25,315
To you, Maze, for saving my mortalized ass.

910
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:27,349
Cheers.

911
00:41:29,645 --> 00:41:32,827
Yes, you may have a point about
the dangers of becoming mortal.

912
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:34,428
There are consequences.

913
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:35,908
I need to be careful.

914
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:37,394
Yes, you do.

915
00:41:37,531 --> 00:41:39,896
Yes, after all, I almost
got our pet detective killed.

916
00:41:42,676 --> 00:41:44,946
Oh, Mazie...

917
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,433
I know that you'll always protect me.

918
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:52,344
No matter how mortal I become,
the Devil can depend on that.

919
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:54,600
Yes, you can.

920
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:57,651
Whatever the danger,
I'll be there to stop it.

921
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:01,298
Whether you see it coming or not.

922
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,567
That's my Maze.

923
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:05,456
Okay.

924
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:51,463
Hello?

925
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:55,639
Hello?
