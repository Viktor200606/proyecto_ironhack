("Ain't No Rest for the Wicked" by Cage the Elephant playing)
- Previously on Lucifer - You're the Lord of Hell, 
for crying out loud
Shouldn't you be spending your valuable time
doing something more significant?
I'm retired, Maze I've got nothing but time
Your return to the Underworld has been requested
Remind Dad that I quit Hell
because I was sick and tired of playing a part in his play
We should be out there solving a homicide 
and punishing those responsible 
We? How could you possibly help me?
I have the ability
to draw out peoples' forbidden desires
I got it I got it The name,
the whole Lucifer thing
And desire is like your superpower
Mm, it's more like a gift from God really
You're thinking about it, aren't you?
See, I wouldn't recommend it
I'm like walking heroin
Ah, you're the Devil
Mm, correct
Give me one second
Please Please don't kill me
You're gonna wish that's all I did to you
I just can't understand 
why you would save a human life 
Something different about her
that I don't quite understand, and it vexes me
Maybe it's not her that's different
Right Here's the deal 
We can have as much naked cuddle time as you desire,
but you're gonna have to listen to me, too
You know, just an existential dilemma or two Deal?
Yes 
Save your soul! It's up to you!
I ask you to repent!
Repent your sins before it is too late!
It is the end of times!
The Devil walks among us!
Padre, you have no idea how right you are
But there's no need to be angry about it
Enjoy the ride
Bless you
Have you seen the face of the Devil?
Oh, every morning in the mirror, pal
Exactly!
He's in all of us!
In our every moment of weakness
Look at this world!
The sin, the lust!
It is the Devil's touch
N-N-No, don't give me credit for all that
You humans do plenty all on your own
What's your problem, pal?
Excuse me?
Yeah, uh, why don't you move your shtick along
Okay, I'm not sharing my tips with you,
- if that's what you're angling for - Oh
Right Is this a performance?
Are you like the Chewbacca and the Spider-Man down the street?
I have to say, you're very good
Yeah, so why don't you go bother them
You're bad for my business
Repent! The Devil
Isn't finished with you yet
You see, what I hate more than anything is a liar,
a charlatan, someone who doesn't believe in what they say
So what are you gonna do about it?
Why, make you a believer, of course
S-S uh, stay away!
He's the Devil!
You don't understand!
This isn't a performance! He's the Devil!
He's the Devil!
It's true It is true
Yes, thanks, everyone
I'm, uh, here till, well, the end of time, actually
- So you're the Devil - Yes 
Yes Well, Satan, Beelzebub, Old Scratch
Actually, I like that one in particular
But, uh, those were the old me
These days, you just have plain old Lucifer
And you've left Hell behind to take a vacation in Los Angeles
Well, where else would I go?
You don't seem too bothered
by my being the Prince of Darkness
I'm willing to work within your metaphor
Right
Sometimes it's easier to make intimate issues
about something bigger than yourself
Well, there are few things bigger than myself
I'm well aware
Ah
Last we spoke, you were bothered about feelings of humanity
I was, yes, but I have good news for you on that front
I'm healed
Is that so?
Yes Yes, back to my normal, devilish self
No pesky empathy to be found
I'd kick a puppy if one waltzed by
I'm joking Puppies don't waltz
You like to hide insecurity in humor,
don't you?
I don't have insecurities
Mm Everyone does
Very well I'll play your game
What do you think I'm insecure about?
That you are changing,
but that you don't know what's causing the change
Or who
We'll pick this up next time
What? Oh, very well
A deal's a deal Though, why do I feel
like you're getting more out of our bargain than I am?
Ooh! Hello!
Thank you Here
- Donald - How are you, sir?
- Oh, I didn't order a drink - Courtesy of the owner
This is from Lucifer?
He asked me to make you something you'd like
Did I get it wrong?
You and Lucifer seem really close
I followed him through the gates of Hell
I'll take that as a "yes"
Hello, Detective
How has your undercover surveillance
of my activities gone so far?
I've looked into you
Your name really is Lucifer Morningstar
And as far as I can tell, you didn't exist five years ago
On the earthly plane, no
People don't appear out of thin air
Who were you?
How did you survive getting shot six times by Jimmy Barnes?
Is that your normal reaction to someone saving your life?
- Investigating them? - When I see something
I can't explain, yeah, I look for answers
Well, I've given you the answer, Detective It's not my fault you won't accept it
Do you know what I think?
I stopped trying to guess
I think you like me
What part of the look on my face gives you that impression?
No, no, no, it's not about the face It's about the eyes,
what's behind them I think you see
something that you truly desire, and you
you don't know what to do with yourself,
do you?
Really?
Uh-huh
- Hmm - That's more like it
Detective, I never knew you cared
Mm
Ooh
No bulletproof vest
What?
I just couldn't imagine how you'd get it
under that suit, but I had to check
What is it? What is it? What is it?
I'm gonna figure out your secret, Lucifer
Not a secret if I'm telling you the answer!
It's
Why don't I affect you, Detective?
What makes you different?
I guess we both have our mysteries
Ah Well, I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Oh, God, not that again
Decker
Are you sure?
Yes
Yes, um, please send me the address
I I owe you one
Oh, finally
Now that affected you What was it?
Detective?
Detective?!
Come on Active scene
The victim was being followed by a paparazzo
Tried to lose his tail
Instead, lost control of his car
Died on impact
The paparazzo following him was?
Was Nick Hofmeister, yeah
Who's the victim?
Robbie Russell Jr
The son of the movie star?
He wasn't in the business, was he?
Didn't stop everyone from wanting pictures of him
They're vultures
You get a statement from Nick?
You can't be involved in an active case until you're off medical leave
Listen, I get why you wanted to be here, I do
But you have to bring him?
You've got to be kidding me
What are you doing here?
Oh! How's your ex?
He's not the reason you rushed over here, is he?
Answer the question
I'm trying to solve my mystery, Detective
If I don't affect you, I'm curious as to what does
Oh, and I think I've just found my answer
Who's that?
He's a paparazzo
Oh Had a little run-in with him
during your Hot Tub High School days, did you? Huh? Is that it?
Yeah, you could say that He's a cockroach
But he'll figure a way out of this He always does
You want to talk to him, don't you?
Well, go on, then What's stopping you?
The rules? Huh?
Detective Douche?
If you desire something, just take it
Lucifer, what are you doing?
Hello
You finally did it, Nick
You finally wanted a photo so bad that you killed someone
You're not gonna get away with this
I'm gonna make sure of it
You're right
- Say that again? - You're right
I went too far I'll confess
Okay
Maybe he's less cockroach, more dung beetle?
Police work always this easy?
No That's the problem
Right Well, do you mind if I give it a whirl?
Tell me, dung beetle,
what is it you desire?
I would like to confess
Yes, yes, yes, but why?
Because I deserve it
I've just done
so many terrible things, you know?
I see it as my chance to-to
Chance to what?
No I
I If I tell you,
- he's just gonna No Just - He? Who?
Would you please make him stop?
- Who? He who? - Him
- Tell him - What are you hiding?
- What are you doing? Hey - You said "he" Who?
Neither one of you are supposed to be here Especially you
Come on
All right Temper, temper
Right Well, that's done
No
If Nick's covering for someone,
that means the real murderer is still out there
Yes, plenty of murderers are out there, Detective
You heard the man He deserves the punishment
At least he's getting it
But that's not enough for you, is it?
You hate that dung beetle
Are you really gonna try and prove his innocence?
I'm gonna find out who really killed this kid
So that's a yes
Wow, aren't you full of surprises
Well, where do we begin?
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull wwwaddic7edcom
You think Nick Hofmeister is innocent? You?
He confessed, Dan
Nick wouldn't confess to a parking ticket,
let alone a murder
It just sounded like
- he was covering for someone - So wait
First he confessed, then he told you he didn't do it?
Well, he didn't want to
You know, Lucifer, um
made him
Do I even want to know what that means?
Look, he was about to tell us more before you came and took him away, Dan
You know what, his car is at the scene
- He confessed - I know
Is this the fight that you want to pick?
Just promise me you'll look into it
I'll do my job
- Go home - Okay
And take your weird club-owner sidekick with you
- before I arrest him - For what?
Let's start with smoking pot at a crime scene
Uh, sorry, do you want a hit?
N-No
It's "puff, puff, pass," not "puff, puff, stomp angrily"
You brought pot to a crime scene?
I most certainly did not
I found it here
You found it?
You found it here at a crime scene?
Yes, in the dung beetle's car
You smoked evidence?
Well, it would've gone to waste otherwise
That's really good stuff you just ground under your heel
Wow
Any sign he'd recently lit up?
Well, there was a a roach from another joint,
freshly smoked
Nick's pupils weren't dilated
He didn't seem high
Maybe he wasn't alone Where's the roach?
Well, I added it to my joint
Well, it's the best part
So our only evidence is currently in your lungs?
Uh, you really wanted to say "up in smoke" then, didn't you?
No No, I most definitely did not
Right, so what should we do now?
I mean, we could head back to Lux
I'm sure there's some stragglers
we could get into trouble with, huh?
I'm good, thanks
More for me, then
Hello, old friend
Bloody hell
Brother, I'm disappointed in you
What?
It's called a devil's threesome for a reason
You were once the brightest of
all of God's angels, Lucifer
And now, look at you
Look, if you've come to lecture me, can you just save it for later?
I'm annoyingly sober right now,
and it takes ages to pour a drink when you're around
- Actually, I'm here with an offer - Really?
Go back to Hell, Lucifer, and I will speak to Father
You're scared, aren't you? That if I don't go back to Hell,
you're gonna have to take over
Oh, that would never happen
Oh, no, no, I mean, it's not like God sent his favorite son
to reign over Hell before, is it?
Oh, wait, sorry
Forgot
So you can take your ultimatum
and shove it up your feathered hole
You can't see it yet, can you?
- What's that? - You saved a human life, Luci
And not for any selfish reasons
No, you did it simply because you cared about that detective
Your time here on Earth is affecting you, dear brother
- You're changing - My life is change
"The same thing over and over," that's your boring motto
True, but usually you're the one controlling the change
This time, you're not
Now, does that scare you?
Because it should
You know, I am tired of your dire warnings, all right?
So just go rattle your saber in someone else's face
You think about my offer
When you've made a decision, you know how to find me
Hey, Robbie, where you been?
If you're gonna follow me,
maybe I can do something good with this
This is the Web site for the Red Cross
Give blood, volunteer
Don't be like the asshat filming this
Good job, kid
Better than I did
- Mommy? - Yeah, baby?
Are you looking at a no-no site?
No Why would you think that?
Because you put it away so fast,
and you look really, really guilty
No, baby, I'm just doing police work
I thought you weren't supposed to be working
And I thought you were supposed to be getting ready
to hang out with your dad
Who is early, apparently
Do you really live here?
I thought I must have gotten the wrong address
How do you afford this place?
Do you take bribes?
I don't And what are you doing here?
Lucifer!
Ah, hello again, small human
Uh, this-this is yours, yes?
Yeah, that's Molly McDowell
She's a ballerina by day,
but a ninja chemist by night
When a simple yes would've sufficed
Right, on you go, then Go on, fetch away
Well, go on, then
Uh, is this too advanced for her?
You're funny
Trixie, babe, come on
Get ready
You need to leave now
I had no idea that Hot Tub High School paid so well
It didn't And can you shh on the Hot Tub? 
She doesn't know
What, that her mom was a giant star?
Why not?
Not 'cause of the old?
Yeah And can you never do that again?
Right, sorry So how do you afford this place?
I don't; it's my mother's
I moved in after Dan and I separated, okay?
Penelope Decker?
Hold on a minute
Your mother's Penelope Decker?
- Queen of '80s cheeseball sci-fi? - Yeah
You have to introduce me
Mm, I don't
- And I probably won't - So you're part of a
family dynasty like me No wonder we get on so well
How did you rebel?
- What do you mean? - Well, you're mad at the dung beetle
You must have done something salacious in your youth
What was it?
Did you kiss a girl and like it?
I don't want to talk about it
Oh, so there is something
Two girls?
- Okay - An Eiffel Tower?
What's an Eiffel Tower?
It's marvelous It's when two chaps high-five
at the top, then the young lady
Okay, there is an eight-year-old in the room
who doesn't need to hear about an Eiffel Tower
What? What about the case?
If I were secretly working on it, having you around
drawing attention wouldn't be good, would it?
Well, maybe not, but be much more fun, wouldn't it, Detective,
if we carried on working together?
Detective?
Detective?
Mm-hmm
I understand
Mm-hmm
Hello, there
I'd very much like to see Nick Hofmeister
I'm afraid I can't Oh
Hello
Hello to you
Hello?
Afternoon, dung beetle
We need to talk
I, um, I'm not gonna tell you anything, man
No, no, no, I don't want to know about the case,
so you can keep your dirty little secrets
No, I'd like to know about Chloe Decker
And you're gonna tell me everything
I have an effect on people
It's a way of pulling out
their deepest desires, revealing the truth within
It works on everyone
Everyone except for Chloe Decker
And I suspect it's somehow related
to my recent bouts of humanity
What does this have to do with me?
Well, you know everything about her, don't you?
All her sordid secrets
I'm hoping they'll help me understand
why she's so frustratingly immune to my charms
Chloe doesn't have any sordid secrets
I've seen the hatred in her eyes when she looks at you
Come on You must have something
Do you know what happened when she was 19?
She starred in Hot Tub High School 
and revealed her rather spectacular assets to the world
Right
And two weeks later, her father died
Oh
Yeah, so I knew, of course,
everyone in the world was gonna try to get
a shot of them leaving the funeral
And I really I really wanted to be first
Oh, dung beetle, tell me you didn't
Yeah, I crashed the funeral
And she oh, she flipped out
But I got my photo
Right when she punched the lens
I mean, right then it cracked the lens right in half
- I made so much money off that photo - I'm sure
Yeah, but at what cost to my soul, right?
And that'll be for someone else to decide
Yeah
Well, that someone else is sitting opposite you,
and it's not looking good
I crossed a line
And I knew it
And after that, I just did everything I could
to keep others from making the same mistakes I did
That's why I
Why what?
- No, it's - You want to tell me
- It's nothing - Who are you protecting
- from following in your footsteps? - I can't
- It's I just I can't - You want to tell me, don't you?
- I really can't - You want to tell me
Who are you protecting?
Who are you protecting?
How are you doing this, man?
Look at me
Who are you protecting?
Please, just
- Look at me Look at me - I won't I won't
- I can't - Look at me!
Leave me alone!
I already spoke to the police about Robbie
I don't know what else there is to say
I'm just following up
I want to make sure there aren't any suspects we overlooked
But I was told Nick Hofmeister confessed
He did
Mr Russell, I, um
I don't think Nick killed your son
What?
Are you Is this a joke?
I'm sorry
Y-You just don't know
what Robbie went through because of my work
Now he's dead because of me
No
You know, my mom is Penelope Decker
So I was followed by paparazzi all my life,
just like Robbie
But, you know, that wasn't my mom's fault
And you got to know, it's not your fault either
The only person you can blame
is whoever ran your son off the road
I want to make sure we get the right guy
And I'm telling you, I don't think Nick is him
There was one other paparazzo
Did you get a name or a description?
No, I didn't
Because Robbie only noticed him once
That's why I never mentioned him before
Thank you
Excuse me
Decker
He did what?
What is wrong with you?
Nothing is wrong with me
I was hoping for sexy, salacious details,
and instead I got taken on a trip down depression lane
You feel bad for invading her privacy?
You're the Lord of Hell
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Amenadiel is right
You are changing
I don't mind the odd smart-assed remark, Maze
They can be quite amusing
But don't you dare disrespect me
Or what?
You'll cry really hard on my shoulder?
You will not speak to me this way!
There he is
How did you get into Nick's holding cell?
And there he goes
Oh, sorry
Am I interrupting some creepy foreplay you two have?
How did you get into Nick's holding cell?
Why, by asking very nicely, of course
Something you should try sometime
This case has nothing to do with you
Why won't you leave it alone?
Why won't you?
Did you learn something, at least?
Yes I did, actually
Our dung beetle is protecting
someone who's following in his footsteps
Protégé, perhaps
I found out someone else was following Robbie,
and someone's been uploading photos online
today from Nick's company
Last one was posted an hour ago
from a party that's still happening
Our killer could be there
Right
Are you coming or what?
Oh, sorry, I thought this was the part where you leave me behind
and say something like, "Lucifer, stay
- Good devil" - I'd rather keep my eye on you
So how do you plan on catching our murderous protégé anyway?
Well, I was thinking, what if he never left the scene of the crime?
What, and instead blended in with the other paparazzi taking photos?
That's quite clever
Yeah, so if we recognize anyone from the crash, it could be our guy
Right
Are you okay?
I'm fine
Why?
Oh, Nick told you what happened, didn't he?
He did
Got to hear all about your wicked right hook
Oh, yeah
He also told me it was a low point for him
Which I believe, actually
Yeah, I think our dung beetle, of all things,
desires redemption for what he did to you
Yeah, well, he's not going about it the right way,
- that's for sure - Yes, well, we all know
what the road to Hell is paved with, don't we?
Hello, hello, hello
There's a familiar face
Yeah, from the crime scene this morning
- I remember him - And he's spectacularly creepy as well,
so that's a bonus
Hey, everybody, it's Chloe Decker!
Penelope Decker's daughter!
- Chloe, look over here! - Guys
- Back off - Chloe Decker!
- Hey, show me your boobs! - Hey, show us your boobs, Chloe!
Back off, you mouth-breathing scaven!
Well, go on then, punch him! Come on, let's punch them all!
It's not me anymore
Well, it's still very much me
You, Friar Tuck,
tell me, is this depravity really all you want out of life?
Hmm?
I want to win a Pulitzer for photography
Pulitzer?
Really? Do you hear that, chaps?
Yeah, they don't give out Pulitzers for nip slips
He's gone
Oh, boy
It's not that bad, is it?
Trixie's classmates all have the Internet
One of them's gonna figure out that her mom is
the top story on their favorite gossip site
She's finally gonna find out about Hot Tub High School 
- Great - If it's any consolation,
you look really good in it
Thanks
Why do I feel like you're cheering me up for even worse news?
Nick's sticking to his story
It's an open- and-shut case,
but I can't help it if a rogue detective
won't leave well enough alone
Oh, you ran the plate number I gave you
Yes, ma'am, I did
It was registered to Nick one of his company cars
Like the one that ran Robbie off the road?
Exactly
Did a little more digging
Guy's name is Josh Bryant He freelances for Nick
Thanks
Why are you doing this?
Because I think you're onto something
So go figure it out while I buy you some time
And be careful
All right?
Oh, sorry Did I ruin your creepy little moment?
I am so happy to see you
I felt so bad about what happened
I'm a huge fan
Hot Tub High School was my favorite growing up
Yes, we're really not interested
in your formative spank bank years, all right?
I'm so sorry about what happened
I would've done something, but I'm not good with violence
Mm
Well, lucky for us, we found you anyhow
You were looking for me? Why?
Because she wants justice for Robbie Russell Jr
What is it you want, Josh?
Hmm?
To be first
To always be first
Really?
What, did Nick teach you that?
To be first?
Yeah I learned a lot working for him
He's my idol
He's the best pap out there
So you took photos of your idol being arrested for murder?
I didn't know what else to do
Other than what Nick would've done
Which is to be first, no matter what
Of course
Just a second
You like smoking pot, Josh?
It's for my nerves I have a prescription
Oh!
Hello
Good timing on that photo
Just lucky I guess
Far be it for me to call someone's morality into question, but
I believe that photo was planned
Yeah
Makes me wonder what else was
Look at this
Celebrity shouting matches,
fistfights
Josh had the first photo on every one
It escalates
Overdose Suicide
- Or so it appeared - Well, I suppose
the best way to be first is to know it'll happen beforehand
So he follows Robbie, intent on running him off the road,
but doesn't count on his own car running off as well
This is cold, premeditated murder
- Mm - Nick's a slimeball
I just I don't think he'd go this far
Which means Josh maybe convinced him to take the fall
The question is: why?
Well, who cares?
We know Josh is guilty Let's punish him
Ah, I could add an ironic twist, like I used to when I ran Hell
Yeah, no, it doesn't work that way,
because I need evidence
Well, you have plenty
Circumstantial
I need concrete proof
I'm gonna talk to Nick
Boring, boring, boring, boring!
You don't decide who gets punished and how
- That's exactly what I do - No, no, you don't
This is how it works, Lucifer
Whatever speech you have brewing, Maze,
I don't want to hear it
I think I've said everything I need to
You're right
And I agree
Let's go deliver some punishment
We believe Josh may be a very disturbed individual
God
He caused all these?
Yeah All of them
I can't believe it I
Tell me what really happened, Nick
I took Josh in when he was 16
He was a runaway
He was a little broken
In him, I saw a little bit of who I used to be
At least, I thought I did
So I took him under my wing
He was a natural
Taught him about all the lines a pap can't cross
You know, 'cause I just I just wanted him to stop
making the same mistakes I did
- Mm - And then, two days ago,
he calls me up, says he's been in a really bad accident,
and said that he totally understood
everything I was saying now
But it was too late
You know, someone was dead
So you took the fall,
hoping that Josh would get a chance at a new life
Yeah
Nick Hofmeister finally tries to do something good with his life,
and he gets played
You must really be enjoying this
I'm really not
Believe it or not, I forgive you
This isn't about you, this isn't about me
This is about Robbie Russell
You know, he was a kid who didn't ask to be famous
He just wanted to live a normal life
Nick, if you don't testify, Josh will do this again
He'll do it again
Excuse me
Oh Just a second
Hey, Dan, this better be important
I think Nick's about to talk
No, I'm not following Josh Why?
What do you mean he's missing?
Desk Sergeant?
- Yes, Detective? - Where did Nick Hofmeister go?
- Did somebody get him? - Why, yes
It was that tall, handsome British fella
Oh, no I did it, too, didn't I?
Oh, I respect what you do, dung beetle
Much as celebrities hate you,
you know, they need you, keep you in the limelight
You're a a necessarily evil
Something I understand all too well
But the-the trouble is that you tried to change
Yeah? And you failed spectacularly at it
Because, well, sometimes we are what we are,
and we should embrace that
What are we doing back here exactly?
And do you need me to?
Maze!
Did you bring me my gift?
I'll kill you, you crazy bitch
Just be polite to the lady
She isn't your enemy tonight
What is this?
Right, well, both of you have committed terrible acts worthy of punishment
However, you will not receive said punishment when you die
It's my fault, really Sorry
So I'm here to fix that
Right now
Oh Amateurs
All right, very well, in terms you'll understand
You both get a gun
Let's see who shoots who first
What's to stop us from shooting you?
Well, despite the waste of bullets, let's see
He's about to rat you out to the police
And he tricked you into taking the fall for a murder he committed
Discuss
You really did it, didn't you?
You killed people
You lost your touch, Nick
All this talk about lines we can't cross
Nowadays, the only way to be first
is to realize that there is no line
And you were almost begging to take the fall
That one dramatic gesture
As if that would erase the fact that you've been a piece of crap
- for the last 30 years - You can't do this
I treated you like a son
Oh, Maze, you fiend
Even I didn't see that one coming
You really would've killed me
Nick
I made a mistake, okay? I realize that now
And I'm sorry
Stop! Don't shoot him!
Detective, you're interrupting my punishment
You, don't talk You're lucky I figured out your insane,
ironic punishment before anyone got killed
Nick, you tried to do some good,
to help someone Don't throw it all away
Nick, embrace who you really are Stop fighting it Come on
Don't listen to him, Nick You tried to change
Yeah
- And look what happened - Yeah
You screwed up, but you know what? It's okay
You tried to change That's what's important
Humans
Fascinating, aren't they?
Do you know, perhaps they're onto something
Nick don't
I was surprised to hear from you, Lucifer
Well, not as surprised as I was
But I wanted to tell you you were right
Hmm Is that a joke?
No, I wish it were
But, no, you were right, and I was wrong
So you'll return to Hell?
What? No!
That is absurd
No, you're right that I've changed in my time here,
and that I have absolutely no control over it
And you know what?
That feels positively thrilling
You asked me here to tell me that?
No, no, no, I thought
I'd use you to remedy a situation that I've mishandled,
and annoy you in the process
Kill two birds with one prayer sort of thing, hmm?
Luci
you should've taken the offer
Oh
You're looking for someone?
But
you were just over there
That's that's impossible
Yes?
I saw Nick pull the trigger
I heard the gunshot, but Josh wasn't shot
Did you put blanks in the guns? Like
Was this some staged thing to get a confession out of Josh?
That's probably more plausible to you than my angelic brother
slowing time while I pluck a bullet out of thin air,
isn't it?
Even with all that,
you were standing right in front of me
I blink, and you're here
Is there a question there, Detective?
You
You know exactly what I'm asking you
And you know exactly what I'll answer
You know, um
it's quite fun, this police malarkey, isn't it?
Are we going to watch a movie, Mommy?
No, babe, I just wanted to talk to you about something
So, before I was a cop,
I was an actress
And I was in a movie
And it was this movie
In the movie, I do some very silly things
Things that, uh,
maybe some of your friends might tease you about
But it is what it is,
and-and that's not me anymore, okay?
I know
Hmm?
I've seen this before, Mommy
You have? Where?
I have the Internet
Oh, right
This isn't even in HD
Mm Hmm
Well, what'd you think?
I thought it's hilarious!
You did?
My favorite part is when you ate too much cake,
and then you puked in that cute guy's hair
That part is really funny
Then you stop, and we think it's all over
Yeah
But then
- Blah! Blah! - Oh
Sorry, Mommy
Didn't mean to hurt you
You didn't hurt me, baby I'm fine
It's gonna get better soon
I hope the guy who hurt you got in lots of trouble
You know, I should go see him
So, the Devil did a good deed today
Oh Hmm
There's no need to call it that
I enjoyed every minute of it
You know what I mean
Mm
You know, I'm so very used to being in control of everything
Not knowing what's gonna come next is
Can be scary
No No, I'm finding it quite exhilarating, actually
Hmm
I think you were right, by the way
About what?
That it may be a "who" that's changing me
But now that begs the question: what do I do with her?
I have to warn you, he's heavily medicated 
I doubt he'll be able to string two words together right now,
much less have a conversation
Thanks
Hey, Jimmy
So this is where you ended up, huh?
I was so wrapped up in recovery, I forgot to come visit
You know, from when you shot me
I have to ask you something, Jimmy,
about that day
What happened to you, Jimmy?
What happened with Lucifer?
Lucifer?
What happened when you shot at me?
- Is he here?! Tell me he's not here! - No
No, Jimmy, he's not here He's not here, Jimmy
I know he's here
I can't get away I can't get away from him!
Jimmy, you're safe here
You're safe
No, I'm not safe! None of us are!
- He's just a man, Jimmy - You don't get it, do you?
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!
He's the Devil!
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

LUCIFER: Previously on Lucifer
So you're the Devil, and you've left Hell behind
to take a vacation in Los Angeles
How could you possibly help me?
I have a certain skill set
I can be very persuasive with people
I got it, the name, the whole "Lucifer" thing,
and desire is like your superpower
- (Lucifer groans) - CHLOE: How did you survive
getting shot six times?
Is that your normal reaction
to someone saving your life?
When I see something I can't explain,
yeah, I look for answers
Well, I've given you the answer, Detective
It's not my fault you won't accept it
CHLOE: What happened with Lucifer?
You don't get it, do you?
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!
LUCIFER: Where's your ex, Detective Douche?
Hi, Daddy
Hi, munchkin
CHLOE: Wow, shocker, you're late
Come on, give me a break
Right, here's the deal
We can have as much naked cuddle time as you desire,
but you're gonna have to listen to me too
LINDA: You like to hide insecurity
in humor, don't you?
What do you think I'm insecure about?
That you are changing,
that you don't know what's causing the change
Or who
_
_
_
(wind whistling)
Go on
Go ahead, jump
You know you want to
Hmm?
Trust me, it's a warm welcome
Won't it hurt?
Oh, there's only one way to find out
Previously on Lucifer
You're the Lord of Hell, for crying out loud
I'm retired, Maze I've got nothing but time
How could you possibly help me?
I have the ability to draw out people's forbidden desires
I got it The name,
the whole Lucifer thing,
and desire's like your superpower
It's more like a gift from God, really
I saw Lucifer do some things that I can't explain
Is Lucifer a magician?
That's sort of what I'm trying to figure out
You were once the brightest of all of God's angels
And now, your time here on Earth
is affecting you, dear brother
You're changing
My life is change
- What are you doing here? - Ooh, how's your ex? Detective Douche?
You like working with the detective, don't you?
I told you, I'm good at punishing people
Nay, I'm the best at punishing bad people
Yeah, well, I think you don't just enjoy punishing the bad guys
I think you're starting to like seeking justice for the good ones
He's the Devil!
He's the Devil! 
Lucifer?
Well,
good morning, Detective
What the hell are you doing here?
- Setting the table - You broke into my house?
Yes, well, I hope you don't mind, but I made a little brekkie
You were taking forever in the shower
What do you do in there?
You are unbelievable!
Oh, thank you, but it's you who should take the compliment
Really kept things up since Hot Tub High School, haven't we?
Ding-dong
I want to shoot you
Tease Do it
I'm immortal, remember?
Uh, do you have any truffle oil?
Lucifer, get out of my house now
- We haven't eaten yet - Out
Well, don't we need to discuss the next case?
There is no next case
- What? - Out
We're already late, so let's go
Lucifer!
Yeah
What in God's name are you doing here?
Nothing in his name Here on my own, actually
Did you and Mommy have a sleepover?
No No Absolutely not, no
What are you guys doing here anyway?
She left her bird report here
- Want to see? - Um, not really
Here, have a snack, child
Are you sleeping with this idiot?
She hasn't had the pleasure, unfortunately, no
Okay, everybody out Trixie has to get to school
I got to get to work Come on, out, please
No, no, no, no, no, you can't throw me out again
Again?
So this is a habit
- Yes, shocking, isn't it? - No
Never been thrown out of anywhere before in my life
Well, except for Heaven, of course
Fine, fine, fine, fine
But somebody please flip the omelet if it's not already ruined
Hey, Dan, I'm
Really, Chloe?
I'm disappointed in you
Good Right, you're here
- Um, I need to chat - Lucifer, we don't have an appointment
Something very disturbing's just happened
It's horrific, really
Uh, for the second time,
I've been thrown out of a woman's house
- Okay, sorry, uh, Lu - I mean, I'm starting to wonder
if the detective has some sort of biological dysfunction
- Lucifer - 'Cause, I mean, I appeal
to the virile urge in all women
Certainly, well, certainly you can attest to that, can't you?
Uh, Lucifer, stop
Yes, of course, sorry Payment first
Uh, no No, no, no, no, no, no No! No!
Hmm?
Lucifer, this is George
George, Lucifer
Lucifer, George
Oops
- Dan, if you're here to scold me - No
I just got off the phone with the lieutenant
There's a case
Day four
Down to three meat sticks, a half a bottle of water,
217 miles to LA
I'm not sure we're gonna make it,
'cause my brother drives like a narcoleptic old lady
Say hi, Grandma!
No, that's our only nourishment!
Her name's Lindsay Jolson
Just turned 22
She went missing catering a Players' Club event
Players' Club?
It's one of those skeezy pickup artist groups
You know, that teach geeks how to be sex gods
Got it
Lindsay was last seen talking to the lead scumbag
The founder, Carver Cruz
So he was interrogated?
Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking
And with no proof, we're stuck
But there's a Players' seminar and after-party today
And you need to go undercover
Why me? I'm homicide
Because you're our best way in
- I am? - Apparently these events
are pretty exclusive, and when I saw the guest list,
I recognized one of the names
I guess a lot of high-end club owners are invited
Oh, come on
No You're kidding
I wish I was
- Lucifer's on the list? - Yeah
Yeah, of course he is
Look
the last thing I want is the guy I found
making my half-naked wife breakfast this morning
spending more time with her,
separated or not
But
This is the best option
I wouldn't ask, but I just keep thinking,
what if this was our daughter?
The detective seems like a very lovely woman
Well, I suppose, but still, she's human
Why is she able to refuse my charms?
I mean, is this thing on?
Yes, yes
Definitely on
It's not that you're afraid that you don't have power over Chloe
It's that you're afraid that she has power over you,
but neither one is true
- No? - No
People don't have power over us
We give it to them
You have to take your power back
Right, go on
You say she's nothing special, but I think you've put her on a pedestal
You need to really get to know her,
warts and all
I'm sure she has some
So, demystify her
by bringing her back down to your own level
You're right
It's not her, it's me
I need to take back control
I need to behave like I always have
Good So you understand
Yes
Yes
I mean, it seems obvious now, actually
I need to have sex with her
Uh no, uh, that's not what I said
No, no, no, you're a genius I mean, that's the best way to lose interest, right?
Right Good-o
Hmm
Thanks, love
Oh, sure
- Payment next time, okay? - Uh
Um
Her name's Lindsay Jolson
Mm-hmm
She's been missing almost three full days
Right, so just ask me one more time
Lucifer, there's a girl missing
Yes, it's just not every day
someone kicks you out of your house, then three hours later asks you on a date
It's not a date It's a work thing
- Oh - And are you gonna help me or not?
All right
But only 'cause it coincides perfectly with my own plan
And what plan is that?
Well, to have sex with you, of course
Okay
Wait, you and I well, there is no you and I
There's a professional situation,
- and I just need you - See, you need me
The department needs you, because you're the one
I'm the one?
On the list for the Player thing
You're quite adorable when you're flustered
I I'm not flustered
I'm nauseous
Now you're blushing; I'd say I'm making headway
Okay, look, let me make myself perfectly clear
I will never,
ever, ever sleep with you
Never
Okay? Got it?
Playing hard to get, I like it
When Hell freezes over, Lucifer
I can arrange that, actually
Get in the car
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull wwwaddic7edcom
Well, hello
Here you are, Mr Morningstar
Well, thank you, lovely
And here's something else you might need
Well, yes, that might come in handy
Pardon the pun
Whoa
Did you just number close the nametag girl?
Oh
Use this wisely You're welcome
I can't believe you
Don't worry, Detective I'm more of a leg man myself
Soon as you say the word, you'll have your turn
Wow, you've never been rejected by a woman, have you?
No
Get your hands off me!
I want to talk to Carver Cruz!
I need you to leave right now, sir
Carver!
Carver, can you hear me?!
It's the missing girl's brother
What'd you do to my sister?!
Get out here, you coward!
It's okay I got this
- I know him - No, you don't
Look, I'm sorry He has to leave the premises
Oh, I don't think that'll be necessary, Officer
Besides, isn't this quite boring?
I mean, there are several lovely ladies milling around out there
Which one do you desire?
You
I'm gay
Oh!
Right
Well, my dance card's full with this one, I'm afraid
But the odds are definitely in your favor out there
Probably not batting for the same team, but you never know
So go on, then Go forth and conquer
I know you want to
Yeah
Right
Off you pop
You're Lindsay's brother
How'd you know that?
Because she's a cop
Great Say that louder I don't think everyone heard you
Right
Sorry, yes, we're here undercover
to find out what happened to your sister
If you can help me, I'll tell you what happened
Carver killed her
Killed her? You sure about that?
No, but
look, I know my sister
She's a good person She's sweet
She wouldn't just run off She's not even from LA
I'm all she has out here
She's all I have
Kevin, I promise you,
if anyone here hurt your sister, I'll find them
And I'll punish them
Any method you prefer
Nice solid flogging Get the ol' swamp nuts in a vice, you know
Okay It's time to go now
Let us handle this, and if we hear anything, we'll be in touch
Okay Thank you
Yeah
We've got this
You have to admit, we're quite a good team
If you weren't so pent-up sexually, we'd be firing on all cylinders, I'd say
I'm assuming you learned most of your moves at events like these
I've never been to something like this before in my life
I certainly don't need any help getting women into bed
Till
Were you hit on the head when you were small?
No?
We are biological machines
We are warriors
We are players!
Gentlemen, we are animals
Men are the wolves, and women
are the fluffy bunnies
So we must prepare ourselves for the hunt
How?
"Follow the list"
Yes! The CKC
The Conduct of Kick-ass Cavemen
One: Be seen
People pay for this?
Yeah, 5,000 bucks
Stand out
The peacock, the lion with his mane
Two: Be a protector
Duh
Women are hardwired to hook up with someone
who can help them survive
It is simple biology, man
Three: Be brave
Take risks
Oh, maybe you should take notes
Four: Be a leader of men
And the most elusive
Five: Be confident
You are
a player!
Own it!
Excuse-excuse me! Excuse me, question!
What are you doing?
The Q&A's after the speech, buddy
No, but it's quite pressing
What if you have all those manly whatnots and a woman still doesn't respond?
You may think you have them, but you don't
- Yeah - That's why you're here, right?
So, gentlemen, you follow these rules,
and you will bed any Betty you desire, guaranteed
No No No, no, no I'm certain I've got everything on your little list,
and more, actually,
yet this woman here won't have sex with me
Just listen to the speech, buddy
The system works
No, but I doubt that
Because because if I can't "bed a Betty,"
then how do you possibly expect
any of these poor miscreants to succeed?
Especially when they're taking advice from a-a wanker such as you?
All right, just sit down, man
Yeah, Lucifer, sit down
I-I just could we get the spotlight over here?
Do we have that?
Yeah, yeah But on-on her
Good Right
Now, you're the expert
You tell me what's wrong with this picture
I mean, I'm me
Right?
And she
Well, she's a cop, for starters
She's a cop?
Yes I mean, talk about the shallow end of the dating pool
This is private property
Unless you have a warrant, you need to leave here immediately
Security!
Security, her, out
Okay, we're gonna take a ten-minute intermission
- All right? Thank you - I haven't finished
All right
Oh, it's you again
Have you two?
I know I'm-I'm sorry, Lieutenant
I No No
I've got it under control
And Mr Morningstar, too, yes
Let me talk to him
It's a her, and no
Really? Your boss is a she?
Even better Give me the phone, I'll fix it
No, you can't fix this!
You've already said enough
Sorry!
Not you
Yes, I-I'll figure out a way into the party
It's not a problem
And-and again, I
So we're going to the Player after-party
Not you I am
Well, I'm not sure how that's possible, now that you've blown your cover
Well, that was 100% your fault
I beg to differ
None of that would have happened if you'd just complied with my request
Do you honestly think you can just ask people to have sex with you and they will?
Well, I usually don't have to ask, actually
But trust me, it'd be a win-win
And probably another win after that
I mean, I have tremendous stamina
There's a girl missing, Lucifer
She's probably in some hellhole somewhere,
scared out of her mind, if she's even still alive
And I found out the party is a cash-only event
That's a first for Carver
So our only suspect's probably about to run off to Mexico,
and you're worried about boning me?
You're right Sorry
- Let's find the girl Okay? - Yes
Sex later
Kidding
Sort of
So where's the party?
Cold Bar
Really?
Well, that place is notoriously overpriced to rent
If Carver wants cash, he shouldn't have it there
No, he shouldn't
I think I just figured out how you can fix this
Oh?
Do tell
Miss me?
I know why you're here I won't help you, Amenadiel
One way or another, Maze,
I am gonna change your mind, so
You're gonna help me get Lucifer back to Hell
Don't make it painful
You forget
I love pain
I'm an angel
You can't beat me, little demon
Stop and hear me out
Men
they always want to talk
Enough!
We want the same thing!
Oh, do we?
Let's see
Uh-oh
Did I hit a nerve?
Mazikeen, we both know
that something has fundamentally changed in Lucifer
Now, aren't you even the least bit concerned?
No
It's a phase It'll pass
You're lying to me
You're lying to yourself
Now, we can help each other
We can get him back to where he belongs,
if you could just provide me with a weak spot
Some insight
No
means no
Uh hello?
Uh, Lucifer?
Be out in a moment Just getting ready
Okay
Uh, did you do what I told you to do
and call Carver about the Player's Club?
Make yourself a drink, Detective
No No No more drinks
No more blurred lines
No more breaking into my house or trying to sleep with me
Look, this is a professional relationship
I'm a police officer, and you
are naked Oh
Speaking of my surprise visit yesterday, I decided turnabout's fair play
You know, tit for tat sort of thing
This is beyond inappropriate
And brave, wouldn't you say?
Number three on the CKC list: take risks
Okay Just
Lucifer, put some freakin' clothes on
All right
But seriously, darling, are you well?
The berries are ripe and ready to be harvested
I mean, look at me
Huh?
Now, you can't argue with that, can you?
What happened to
My God
Oh, oh
Well, yes, I suppose it is his fault
Whose fault?
My father
Your dad did that to you?
No, no, no That's where I cut my wings off
- What? - Well, I didn't
Maze did I told her to
N-No
Seriously
What is that?
Don't, please
Okay
I should get dressed Otherwise, we'll miss the party
So you did make the call?
Yes, yes, yes, yes
Party's at Lux
Turns out, the words "open bar" are indeed effective
So good on you
Okay
Can't go wearing that scruffy little getup
You'll stick out like a sore cop
Where did you get this dress anyhow?
Oh, it was left behind by one of my overnight guests
What was she wearing when she left?
- A smile - Mm
If I get an STD from this thing, I'm gonna kill you
Oh, there he is
Oh, he doesn't look suspicious at all
Hmm, so what's the plan, Detective?
Avoid him for now
Mingle, find people who were at the party last week
See if anyone saw Carver with our missing girl
- Hey - Hi
- Are you from Tennessee? - No
Because you're the only ten I see
Oh, you poor soul Does that actually work?
- No - No, I didn't think so
It's cute
It-it is?
Yeah
Y-You're cute
You're really cute
Hey, were you at that party last week?
Uh, no, actually, this is my first
Okay
I love this song!
Okay
Hey, oh, were you at the party last week?
Uh, I think the dress may have backfired, actually
I think we've been spotted
Clearly a man with nothing to hide
Move!
Get out of the way!
Just
get out
Move!
Just come
Give me the gun, Carver
Just-just let me go, okay?
I need to go!
I'm afraid that's not possible, but I do have another option for you
How about a broken back, hmm?
You don't understand, I have to go!
They're gonna kill her now!
You just killed Lindsay!
They? They who?
The people who took her
- Where is Lindsay? - I don't know, okay?
I swear to you, somebody kidnapped her
If that's the case, then why wouldn't you go to the cops?
Because they said they'd kill her if I did
Maybe they already have
Excuse me, dear, I don't know why we bother
with all these pithy little police questions
Tell me
what game's the player playing, eh?
What are you after?
I just want Lindsay back
I swear, I would never hurt her
I love her
But she's a fluffy bunny
You're a wolf
You-You've built an empire on the objectification of women
Yeah, I know I'm a complete hypocrite
But I-I would give anything to get her back
You humans
You never cease to amaze
Okay, Carver,
say what you're saying is true
How long have you and Lindsay been together?
Four months
Next Tuesday
I tried to keep it quiet,
'cause, you know, I'm the man and everything
I guess it got out
So you're saying you slept with Lindsay on multiple occasions,
but you still want to be with her?
Yes, and for the rest of my life
Well, after four months,
you haven't got her, you know, out of your system?
How's that possible?
Okay
You have no idea where they're holding Lindsay?
No But they did send this to me
after the seminar
Said no more cops or she's dead
So the kidnappers were there yesterday watching you
I just hope they weren't at the party
If they hurt her, I
It's okay
Is there anyone you suspect that might do this to you?
Enemies?
Uh, I'm kind of a polarizing guy
Okay, the hater list is long
Hello there, this is Lucifer Morningstar
Who are you talking to?
- Shh - Do not shush me
- Who's on the phone? - All one word, that's right
Yes, I'll be speaking on Carver's behalf from now on
No, I'm not a cop
I assure you
- Is that the - Yes, it's the kidnappers
What are you doing?
Of course we have the money
Just give me a time and location
Give me the phone
No, I promise you, no police
All right?
Okay, then
- See you shortly Bye-bye - Wait, wait
Wait, we need proof of life
Oh
Um, just a minute
How do we know Lindsay's still alive?
No, they've hung up
What are you doing?
Not to worry I've handled it
I'll be making an exchange on your behalf this evening
Cash for your lady love, all right?
Really?
Uh, but why would you do that for me?
Well, isn't it obvious?
Number two on your list: be a protector
Is it working?
You're not doing this alone
Afraid so
I promised, no police
A deal's a deal, especially one with the Devil
Besides, I'm the only one not risking his life on this
Immortal, remember?
Carver,
I'm all right
I'm a
I don't know where I am
Please come get me
I love you
Please
I'm coming with you
No, I can't let you do that
I'm not gonna call this in, but you have to stay here
No discussion I'm coming with you
Fine
You'll have to wait in the car
Ten more minutes
Patience
Something doesn't feel right
Well, of course it doesn't It's a kidnapping
Cool ranch puff?
No, thanks
- No? - Mm
It's funny, isn't it? You'd think the king of hellfire
would be more of a flaming hot guy, but love these bad boys
Okay, let's say you really are the Devil
All-powerful, immortal, blah, blah, blah
Does that mean you don't feel pain at all?
Hmm I like this line of questioning
Does this mean you're finally coming around?
No Just answer the question
Well, I I do feel something,
but it's not pain so much as, uh,
a pressure, a nuisance, really
Okay, so what does it feel like if you get shot?
Ow
Well, you asked
But that's it? Like, a bullet just bounces off you?
Well, there's no wound or blood, if that's what you mean
Can verify with something sharp if you like
No, it's not necessary It's tempting though
Huh
So, does this mean that you believe me?
I'm afraid I can't offer anything obvious like a tail as proof
- And so no horns - No, afraid not
That's the stuff of movies and TV
Mm-hmm
They always get it wrong
Well, look, I-I have to admit,
I've seen some things I can't explain,
but I don't believe in all that Bible stuff
So you're an atheist How ironic
No, not exactly
I do believe there's good and evil and right and wrong
But the whole fiery damnation thing, no
Does it scare you?
No, I mean, how could I be scared of something that I don't believe in?
Do I scare you?
No
Is that Carver?
Hmm?
How did he get here?
Oh, he must have followed us
- Well done, Detective - No, he didn't follow us
He must have gotten the address somehow
Or someone told him
Either way, he's gonna get someone killed, probably himself
This love thing makes you all quite stupid, doesn't it?
Lucifer!
Lucifer!
Sorry, but I gave my word no police
Seriously?
Don't worry, Detective
I'm immortal, remember?
I knew it
Hey, guys, I'm gonna need you sooner than I thought
Is SWAT ready?
Manly as ever
Why are you here?
We had a perfectly good plan in place
Well, after you left, the kidnappers called back
They said they changed their minds, and I come or the deal's off
Oh, that sounds sinister
Just hand over the cash,
and no one gets hurt
Yes, right Got it here
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Where's Lindsay?!
I want to see her
No My rules
Money first
Now, Mr Kidnapper, I believe that's a fair request actually,
so just pop her around and the money's yours
Greedy little jackal, aren't you?
Give it to me!
Most certainly will not
Hey, f-forget it!
Just-just give it to him!
I just want her back
Fine
Now bring us the girl
I'm sorry
That's not gonna happen
What?
I will kill you!
Oh, it's gonna happen
A deal's a deal
I am not leaving here without Lindsay
No way
Dearie me
What is it about you and guns, eh?
Carver?
Oh, no
Lindsay?
Wait Lindsay Lindsay?
Love of your life Lindsay?
Yeah, sorry, but I can't let you shoot my brother
What's up, jackass?
I don't understand
Don't you though?
This foul woman and her backwood brother played the player
Lindsay kidnapped herself
Hell truly hath no fury like a woman scorned
You did scorn her, didn't you?
No No
For the first time in my life, I didn't
I loved her
I love you
Love me?
Are you kidding? You didn't even remember my name!
What are you talking about?
I met you two years ago, Carver
We slept together
And then you never called again
Guess I was research for your stupid book
No, no, that's not possible
No, I-I would've remembered
Nope
I met you at the library
It's a good place to score desperate babes
That's in Chapter 11, I believe
Oh, that's bad
I was a virgin, Carver
That's worse
It was just another night for you,
but it was a big deal for me
Oh, God, I'm I am so sorry, Lindsay
I-I'm different now
No, I don't think so
But I am
Okay, may I speak now?
Because I happen to be an expert on punishment,
and I'm not sure it fits the crime here
I mean, Carver made a mistake
well, several really
but
you're different
He's changed
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Shut up
You shouldn't even be here
Now you're dead, too
Shoot them, Linds
Sorry, can't let you do that, darling
I mean, I'm indestructible,
but he's off limits as well, I'm afraid
No, she's right I-I deserve it
No, you don't
Chlamydia, the clap,
raging case of crabs
that's what you deserve, not death
And you
how are you any better?
Why do humans think they can rectify one evil with another?
I mean, it's clearly the first time
this reptile has truly loved a woman,
and this is his reward?
Get away from her!
Oh, God
- I'm sorry - Sorry?
Please don't hurt me
Why does everyone say that before they're punished?
Don't kill me!
Lucifer
Don't move
Detective, you should leave
Who are you?
What are you?
Did you do this?
I've been trying to tell you, I'm the Devil
That's that's not possible
I assure you, Detective, it is
I mean, you've said yourself, there are things you can't explain
You need more proof? You've got the gun Come on, shoot me
No
I can't shoot you
Sure you can Go on, give her a squeeze, we'll be good to go
- No - Just shoot me, Detective!
Please! Because maybe you'll finally realize
Good for you!
See? Hardly hurts
I can't believe
Gah Actually, no, it's hurting a little bit
It's Gah! It's hurting a lot
Son of a bitch, that really hurts!
I'm bleeding
- You're bleeding - I'm bleeding
Oh, crap, of course you're bleeding
God, what have I done?
I don't I don't bleed It's
Lucifer,
I'm so sorry Are you okay?
What does this mean?
Well, it means I shot you
And I'm an idiot, and I'm sorry
And I'm in so much trouble
Ah! It really hurts!
What's happening to me?
Well, speak of the devil
Mr Morningstar here was just telling me everything you did in there
Right
Well, Lieutenant
I was just telling your boss if you hadn't acted
in the way that you did, then,
well, all hell would've broke loose
Isn't that right?
Right
Mm
Absolutely And, um
But you caught the bad guys; that's the main thing
Again, I'm sorry that you got caught in the crossfire, Mr Morningstar
Oh, it's just a graze I hardly felt it
And call me Lucifer
Lucifer
Thank you again for all of your help
You are so welcome
Bye, now
I thought you didn't lie
I don't
But I don't always tell the whole truth
Thank you
You're welcome
Come on, I'll drive you home
I should bloody hope so, now you've crippled me
Wuss
Thanks, Julia
Have a good night Drive safe
Mommy!
Hey!
What are you doing up?
Can't sleep when you're not home
Come on, I'll tuck you in
What's that on your shirt?
Oh
Um, that's, uh that's ketchup from lunch
Nuh-uh That's blood, Mom
Right You're right
Well, um I may have hit someone
with a bullet
You shot someone? Again?
Barely
Who?
It was Lucifer
- Is he okay? - He's fine
It was nothing
It was, like, a little graze
Okay
What, babe?
Remember last week, I told you that boy Noah
kept throwing French fries at me at lunchtime?
- Mm-hmm - And you said
it actually might mean he likes me?
Yes
Well, since you shot Lucifer,
it must mean you really like him
Hmm
You know, it is bedtime, you little weasel
You weasel I'm gonna get you
Story time! Story time!
I know
Tough day at the office
What happened to you?
Oh, you'll never guess
She shot me
And I bled
What?
That's not possible
I know
What's causing this?
Is there something you're not telling me?
Don't think about it too much It's exciting
No, it's dangerous
We've had our fun here, Lucifer, but this can't happen
Tell me we're going home
On the contrary, Maze
The fun's just begun

Previously on Lucifer
Make yourself a drink, Detective
No more drinks
No more blurred lines
No more trying to sleep with me
And you are naked
This is beyond inappropriate
What do you think I'm insecure about?
That you are changing
But that you don't know what's causing the change Or who
Something has fundamentally changed in Lucifer
We can get him back to where he belongs
if you could just provide me with a weak spot
Are you sleeping with this idiot?
She hasn't had the pleasure, unfortunately, no
- Hey, Dan, I - Really, Chloe?
I'm disappointed in you
How could you possibly help me?
I have the ability to draw out people's forbidden desires
And desire is, like, your superpower
It's more like a gift from God, really
What are you?
I've been trying to tell you I'm the Devil
Just shoot me, Detective, please
Because maybe you'll finally realize
Son of a bitch, that really hurts
She shot me, and I bled 
That's not possible
Well, don't think about it too much; it's exciting
The fun's just begun
I very much approve of Benny's avant-garde approach to clothing
The models don't appear to be wearing any
The Benny Choi brand isn't about clothes
It's the shoes
These guys kill for limited-edition kicks
Six G's a pair
Oh, even the Mistress of Excess is impressed
Go, Benny
Oh, hello
Mmm, dangerous
Lucifer likes
You were shot and you bled
No sharp objects until we find out why
Oh, quite the opposite
The danger of getting hurt's positively thrilling
Fun with mortality
Bring it
Excuse me
Since when does the Devil care about mortality?
Great show, Benny
Ladies and gentlemen, Benny Choi!
Now, come on, gorgeous, you tell me your most dangerous desire
Cheeseburger
Cheeseburger? Really?
Benny, get down!
What was that?
It's a bit early for last call
Never mind
You need to leave Now
What's the rush? It's just getting exciting
Humans are playing with their guns, and now they're running for cover
No reason to find out if your bones will break too
Well, what about my broken heart?
Move!
Get down! Get down!
Move, move! Y'all got to move!
Come on! Let's go!
People really do kill for Benny's shoes
- We need to get out of here now - Why?
I just found my danger
She snuck out of the house
I thought she was asleep
Mrs Cortez, I'll find who caused your daughter's death
I promise you
You okay?
Her only child was trampled to death,
after some thug fired into a crowd
I've been better
Gang Unit's piggybacking Homicide till we can figure out who wanted Benny Choi dead
Is he talking?
Clammed up as soon as we got to the crime scene
Okay
It could get bloody
You should probably stay as safe as possible on this one
Oh, yeah? Stick to the nice girly murders?
It just seems that every time I turn around,
you're in another shootout with your buddy Lucifer by your side
Not an issue
He was just, I don't know,
uh, some mystery that I wanted solved
I could think of a few other choice names
Yeah, how about complete wack job?
Don't worry, Lucifer Morningstar is completely out of my life
Right
Get this one tighter
- Tighter? - Yeah
Really, Officer?
And he's sitting on my desk
Get out of that one
Please tell me I'm hallucinating
Well, I am dreamy, but try to contain yourself
What are you doing here?
I'm not actually here to see you
I've come to talk to your boss
About a shooting
Okay, I thought you had my back on this
If the department finds out what really happened, I could lose my badge
What, you mean the fact that you shot me on purpose?
I told you I was sorry about that
And I feel badly, I do But it was a graze
I doubt it even left a scar
Didn't it?
Mr Morningstar?
- I can see you now - Splendid!
Splendid We've so much to discuss
Ooh
So what can I do for you?
Well, Lieutenant,
as you know, I was witness to that grizzly death at Benny's
I mean, only a matter of time
before those gentlemen start pointing fingers
and the whole the whole thing explodes
- And? - I want in
- In? - On the action
I got a taste of danger, and I want more
This case is the perfect method for me to explore my mortality
in an exciting and dangerous way
And help find out who's responsible for that poor girl's death, of course
I realize you've been very helpful to Detective Decker
on her last couple of cases, but
exploring mortality is not really what I do here
- No? - Uh-uh
It's funny, 'cause you're an ambitious one, aren't you?
I can tell
Brimming with desire
If I'm gonna be the first female chief of police,
I need a big close
Of course you do Of course you do
And how do you plan on achieving this grand goal?
I will never be appointed without the support of the minority communities
Right, yes
Well, I tell you what
If you allow me to assist on this case,
and possibly others,
I'll deliver you all the support you need, eh?
Just consider it a favor
From a friend
After you
Thank you so much
Olivia, I can explain
Oh, you better explain why you have been keeping
such a valuable resource all to yourself
Excuse me?
We have someone who can make Benny Choi talk
Someone with charm,
- likability - And has real ties to the community
Here it comes
Lucifer Morningstar has volunteered
to act as liaison in the Paola Cortez case
You're welcome, Decker
Steady on
That wack job's gonna totally get me killed
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull wwwaddic7edcom
What could you have possibly said 
to con your way onto another case?
Well, I simply offered the lieutenant a favor
She gets what she wants, and I get what I want
a nice juicy gang war
You mean you offered to help prevent a gang war, right?
Tomato, tom-ah-to
But, see, that's why we make such great partners
The "he said, she said" of it all
The yin-yang, the fireworks
Partners?
More like glorified ride-along
Just think, you and me, close proximity at all times
Yeah, in LA, we call that "stalking"
It's wonderful, isn't it?
Uh, when do I get my own gun?
I wouldn't trust you with my kid's lightsaber
- And when do I get - I'll never let you drive
If I'm gonna be forced to work with you again, I call the shots
You most certainly do
Right in the leg
I only shot you because you told me to
In a moment of weakness, I somehow fell for your hocus-pocus
and believed that you actually might be the Devil
I am the Devil
Historically invincible, until now,
and that's what makes this case so exciting
real danger
It's the perfect opportunity to see what other mortal qualities I have
Okay, I get it you want to feel new things
Exactly
- How's that? - Bloody hell!
That hurt!
Do it again
So where to, eh?
Stakeout, ambush?
You know, I'm quite skilled at restraints
No, I'm taking you home
Ooh, how did you know?
That I'd last about ten minutes with you?
I don't know, call it a gut feeling
Well, it's a successful one
We'll be right on time
Time? For what?
Lucifer, my man!
Benny!
Nice to see you
So you're friends with Benny Choi and his blinged-out pet pig
- Of course you are - Mm-hmm
His name is Pig Diddy
This is my assistant Hector
Ooh
Someone love his mommy?
Ex-Marine, bitch
Right
Yes, Benny and I go back to the start of his very impressive career
Huh, let me guess, you did him a favor
Lucifer helped me get my first show
He was a real inspiration
I try to reflect that in my art
Any idea who took a shot at you?
Nope
No recent threats, nothing?
Look, I'm no snitch
Even if I did know, I can't talk
I'm an artist
I process tragedy through my work
Would you prefer to process tragedy back at the precinct?
'Cause I have a holding cell that could really use an artist's touch
Yes, Benny, that favor you owe me,
I'm calling in my IOU
Answer the detective's questions
Hector clashed with some punks in Latin Kings colors that night
We were at capacity, they wanted in
They were making threats, they were upset
And you didn't mention this at the crime scene because?
My fans aren't just buying shoes
They're buying Benny Choi
Artist, activist, man of the people
You know, I wore colors back in the day
Asian Boyz I was low level
You know, a punk
Got out before the cops even knew my name
Ah, protecting your rep
Wouldn't want to risk that seven-figure endorsement deal, would we?
I didn't talk because if a Latin King hears
an ex-Asian Boy done dry-snitched him to the cops?
Those thugs will retaliate on principal
I was trying to prevent more death
Well, aren't we the little saint?
Latin Kings versus Asian Boyz
That really narrows it down
Did you get names?
Diego, Dani, I don't know
A couple, I think
Joined at the hip
Mm-hmm
Diego and Dani Right
You need to call me if you remember anything else
Uh, yeah, I'll call
But be careful
Them Latin Kings about to raise hell
My "speciality"
Did it ever occur to you to tell me that you're tight with Benny?
That you gave one of your favors to a former gang felon?
Well, I've been giving favors for thousands of years
Would you like a peek at my ledger?
No, I'd like you to follow basic protocol
And I'd love to continue the debate on our opposing views of police work,
so how about we hit the cop bar,
and get dangerous with some bottom shelf, huh?
A girl's dead and you want to go on a pub crawl
Oh, liquid courage
I hear the Paddock Lounge is every new detective's rite of passage
Forget it We need to wait for an ID on those kids
150,000 active gang members in LA,
it could take awhile
Oh, you're right No time for a quick drink, then
We're on duty
You are the oldest young person I've ever met!
And coming from an immortal, that's saying something
Look, I'm not gonna drink at a bar where everyone hates me
Did you ever consider they hate you for that very reason?
Yeah, they hate me for several reasons
Well, don't let those Philistines inhibit your right
to toast our first break in the case come on!
It's the least you could do
Besides, you know, I
need something to dull the pain
Ugh! If I say yes, will you shut up about the leg?
No promises
Ooh! Aah!
Here comes that bitch Decker
Who's the hell's that guy?
Want me to lose this guy?
It's Italian wool
Touch it I know you want to
Go on
Yeah That'll do
Well, somebody's not being crowned homecoming queen, are they?
Yeah Order Please
Right
Uh, two shots of your finest swill, please, love
- You got it - I'll have a water
So, about this whole favor thing
What what is it?
What are you, some kind of loan shark?
Con man? Godfather with a twist?
But surely you've heard the expression
"Deal with the Devil"?
- Mm! - Come on, give me a break
No, people come to me to ask for favors,
and more often than not, I'm happy to oblige
What do you get?
Well, sometimes, I have something in mind,
but, usually, like with Benny,
it's simply to be repaid at a later date
A devilish IOU, if you will
Who would take a deal like that?
They all do
Palmetto Bitch
Ooh! Juicy! Do tell
That's Anthony Paolucci
He's partners with the guy who took a bullet in the Palmetto case
Malcolm Graham
Ah, yes, the infamous Palmetto
Malcolm got shot meeting with some gangsters,
and Paolucci thinks he took the bullet
like a hero; I think he was on the take
Aha! So you're a snitch
A nog No wonder nobody likes you
Yeah, you'd think I was guilty of a crime
Yeah, you know what they say: "Snitches end up in ditches"
Oh, thanks, man
I feel so much better
Hm!
No, I don't know, I just
was following my gut, I guess
Caught in the crosshairs of another man's crime
I don't need your sympathy, but thank you
Fair enough
Still, no excuse for that man's rudeness
No, no, no, no I can handle Paolucci
I don't need you to stand up for me
Understood
Excuse me
Hello
- What do you want? - Well, firstly,
let me state that I'm in no way
standing up for my associate, Detective Decker
But on behalf of myself, and only myself,
I think you're a complete sack of ass
Are you crazy? Let's get out of here
And your name?
Mazikeen
How do you spell that?
Surprise me
Interesting choice of venue
What, are you trying to throw me off-balance?
Because I'm much more comfortable among humans than you might think
So I see
This is my favorite place in the city
Really?
Look at them on their laptops,
writing the next great screenplay,
torturing themselves with dreams they know,
deep down, they will never achieve
Reminds me of home
Get to the point
I want to go back
Then give me something, Maze
Give me something that I can use against Lucifer,
and I'll make sure you're both back where you belong
That's the problem
He doesn't confide in me anymore
But
there is someone he does talk to a doctor
And I bet she would love that ridiculous suit
And here I thought you were the loyal soldier
I want what's best for Lucifer
Same thing you want
Then tell me about this doctor
"Mike"
Hello?
Is anybody there?
I know Krav Maga!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you
How did you get in here?
I have a key
Yeah, let me start over
Uh, I actually just moved into the office next-door
I'm Dr Canaan
Oh, okay
Hi Uh, I'm Linda
Uh, Dr Martin
It's fantastic, actually
The thrill of fighting humans
has taken on a whole new spin, now that I might get hurt
Although, sadly, the only thing broken was that incontinent troll's nose
- Your behavior is foolish - Oh, come on!
You used to love danger
Since when did Hell's favorite torturer become my mother?
You're changing
Becoming vulnerable
Maybe even mortal
Mm!
If I'm not going to look out for you, who will? Hmm?
- Your pet cop? - That's what partners are for
She is not your partner
Have you two been talking?
You know, I actually don't think it's my mortality that you're worried about
You're just jealous that I'm exploring it with Detective Decker
Jealous of a mortal woman?
Mm-hmm
I don't think so
But if you insist on continuing this exploration,
maybe next time, I won't be around to save your ass
Mm! Well, that is a shame
'Cause you and my backside used to get on very well
My front side, as well, actually
Things change, Lucifer
Yes, but you don't, Maze
You exist to protect me
To know where I am and who I'm with at all times,
whether you want to, or not
Pretty sure your name's not on the list
It should be
Considering I've just spent the last couple of hours
convincing Anthony Paolucci not to press charges
Well, what if I want to press charges?
- For what? - Stupidity
A drunk, on-duty cop surely that's a no-no
But don't worry, I'm feeling charitable
I'll let it slide this time
Is it my thanks you want, or a kiss?
I don't want your thanks
Because I don't do favors for guys like you
I did this for Chloe
Oh, stop raining on the poor woman's parade
It's about time she got some spark in her life
Spark?
How about real danger?
Do you have any idea how easy a gang vendetta can spiral out of control?
Well, I'm trying my best to find out Yeah
That's exactly why I'm here
Chloe is the mother of my child, you imbecile
You want to work this case?
Take care of her
Sir, yes, sir
Okay, Latin Kings turf 
You need to have my back on this 
You can count on me, Detective 
All right, Dani and Diego Ramirez
Married straight out of juvie; real hotheads
Ooh! Do we get to kick in the door?
As your self-sacrificing partner, I volunteer to go first
No, there'll be no kicking in of anything,
unless we have a warrant,
or people are in immediate danger
You better start taking this case seriously
If this escalates to a gang war
Yes, yes, it could spiral out of control
blood could run in the streets, fire could rain down
You sound just like your ex
What do you mean you spoke to Dan?
Mm!
He dropped by Lux
Kept rambling on about keeping you safe
Quite condescending, if you ask me
What is it with the men in my life?
I'm a man in your life?
Uh, Detective, you seem to have left on the central locking!
Act like a child, get treated like a child
Wha? Isn't it illegal to leave your child locked in a car?
Diego and Dani Ramirez, LAPD
Need to ask you a few questions
LAPD! Open up!
Come on, baby
Let me make you feel better
Who the hell are you?!
What are you doing here?!
What are you doing in my house, man?!
How the hell did you get out of the car?
Child's play, and good thing I did
There was immediate danger
He was about to leave this woman completely unsatisfied
- What the?! - Hey! Hey!
- Down - He's your partner?
Yeah, don't get me started
Cops harass us no matter what we do!
And now they're breaking into our house?!
I should sue that pervert!
You have my blessing
But first, let's talk Benny Choi
Yes, did you attempt to use him as target practice the other night?
- That wasn't us! - No
Okay, well, witnesses said they heard you making threats at the door
No, we-we just wanted in
We wanted a pair of Benny's sweet kicks
Enough to pay for them with Paola Cortez's blood?
Paola was Diego's cousin, okay?
It's wack what happened to her
Why do you think he's so upset?
I promised I'd get her in the show
There wasn't enough room for three, so we gave her our spot
She wanted to be a designer
Sorry, is that, is that flop sweat
or is that a tear?
That's Oh
Oh, bloody hell
This is our bad guy?
No wonder he can't get it up
Look, uh
if you didn't take a shot at Benny,
then help us get justice for Paola
Tell us what you know, all right?
If anyone had beef with Benny Choi, it's Yellow Viper
"Yellow Viper"?
Sounds like a venereal disease
He got out of jail a few nights before Benny's show
He was a big-deal graffiti artist, ran with Benny back in the day,
then took the fall on some B&E
He got five and change, while Benny got rich and famous
Well, it does sound like this Viper fellow has every reason to punish Benny
We need to present a unified front
Speculate later, not in front of them
Got it
So, Viper's beef killed your cousin then, eh?
What? That wasn't speculation
That was a statement of potential fact
And if we ever run into him,
he won't have to worry about no cops
So you're just gonna sit around and wait for revenge?
That's rather lazy
Okay, this is the opposite of helping
What? I was promised a gang war
Instead I get a cry baby This is boring
All right, tough
Right now, we need to warn Benny that his buddy Viper's back in town
My apologies for him
Thanks ever so
Ooh, let me guess
Anemic sext from Sir Douche?
No, from Benny
Someone else is dead
Ooh, less boring!
Benny?
Some street artist
Oh, dear
Crazy guess: That's not paint
Mm
Definitely blood, though
But curiously, not human
Benny?
Poor Diddy
This is the murder?
I'm sorry I didn't know who else to call
Ain't no 911 for pets
Bacon for dinner, I guess
And my deepest condolences, Benny
What happened?
Hector and I went to an opening
Came back to find
it's Pig Diddy
Were you aware that your old friend Yellow Viper
was released from prison last week?
No, I had no idea he was out
No phone calls? No contact?
I sent him letters when he was inside San Quentin
Money for lawyers, too
But he sent the letters back all torn up
Didn't take a dime
I always felt bad for how things turned out
How I got lucky
Viper went down
He was my best friend
Well, with friends like that, I'd hide the knives
Yeah, Viper must've snuck into my show
He fired those shots
Killing Pig Diddy was a message
All right, we'll get a squad car to watch your house tonight
Viper comes by, you'll be safe
Aw, y'all don't know him like I do
He's fierce He won't stop till it's my blood on the floor
Thanks, Benny
You know, they really don't make bad guys like they used to
We need to get word to Viper's parole officer
Track him down before he can get to Benny
Finally, some real action
I'm more than ready to face the danger of the notorious Yellow Viper
Oh!
Hello there, neighbor
Is everything okay?
I was just wondering if you would care to grab a drink?
- Oh? - Yes
I actually need someone to confide in
"Confide in"?
About a patient; a troubling one
Oh, oh
So, a-a doctor, a doctor-to-doctor thing
Exactly
And, hey, listen, if you have any patients you need to talk about
You have no idea
Good, so it's settled then
You share with me, I share with you
A fluid exchange
Maybe one drink
I mean, seriously, 
a community center?
This is where we'll find the deadly Yellow Viper?
According to his parole officer
Oh, after five years behind bars, a brothel would be my go-to
You know, I've been thinking about that favor that you gave Benny
Did it also involve getting him off on the felony B&E charge
that put Viper in prison instead?
Well, I may have pulled a few strings why?
Well, if Viper hadn't have gone to prison,
he wouldn't have targeted Benny and shot up his show,
which means Paola Cortez would still be alive
Wait, you're not seriously blaming me for that girl's death?
Just stating fact
Cause and effect; intended or not
No, no I-I can't be held responsible
for what happens after I give someone a favor
I mean, if there's one thing the Devil knows,
it's that people need to take responsibility
for their own bad behavior
Yes, people do need to take responsibility for their own bad behavior
I just said that
Are you hearing impaired?
Remember
tagging means nothing if it doesn't come from right here
Hmm
Yellow Viper, I presume
He's teaching art to youngsters
I mean, this bad guy thing's gonna be all the joke now
What next cuddles and ice cream?
Private class
I'm Detective Decker
This is Never mind
I need to ask you a few questions about the shooting at Benny's fashion show
You got a warrant?
If not
beat it
I'm not talking to cops
Ooh, do you have something to hide, Mr Viper?
Or do you go by Yellow?
Oh, you think I'm gonna let you bust my balls in front of these kids?
Arrest me or step off
Ooh, charming
- Is everything okay? - Well, he's right
He doesn't have to talk to us
He really seems to care about those kids
It's odd for a criminal
Or anyone, really
You know, if you spent as much time
appealing to suspects as you do annoying me,
things might go
go a lot faster
Our lucky day
Viper and the perv
Bravo, crybaby This is a bold move, isn't it?
Come on, turn around
If you walk away now, no one has to get arrested
No one has to get hurt
Yeah, they do Viper killed my cousin
- I'm here to get justice! - As you should
Are you insane? Shut up
What?
Please, I promise we're dealing with this
You and your perv partner want to get caught in the crossfire, cop, be my guest
Smoke this piece!
Enough danger for you yet?
Just stay there Stay there
I'm curious
Right
This ain't about you, it's about Viper!
Hey, now if you'd just give that gun I'd asked for
- Stop talking - Okay
Diego?
Diego, put down your weapon
Don't listen to her
This isn't what you want
Taking down Viper is exactly what he wants
We're doing it for Paola! Step off!
I said step off!
You know, as the Master of Punishment,
I completely understand your desire to make Viper pay
for the tragic death of your cousin
Lucifer, you do remember that bullets hurt, right?
And furthermore, you do seem to have this danger thing down pat,
don't you?
I mean the Devil could learn a thing or two
The Devil? The hell you talking about?
So, answer me this:
So, you engage in turf wars, yet nobody actually owns any turf?
Get back, freak!
All right, let's finish this
And-and those trousers I mean, you wear them so low that,
well, your ass is exposed to other naughty men,
and we all know what kind of danger that can bring,
don't we? I mean, you can park your bike in there
You making fun of his pants, yo?
Well, are we talking pants or trousers?
Because it's very confusing
Where'd he go?
- Oh, dear - Don't matter
I'll kill you first
Hey, what's happening?
Where's Viper?
You had your hero moment stay down, or you're gonna get shot!
Indeed!
What's that? What happened?
What the hell is happening?
Maze is happening
Your bartender's a ninja?
- Of course she is - Yeah
What's that?
Shattered tibia
Ooh, ouch orbital fracture
It was first perfected in the hellfires of Tyre
Oh, the humerus crush!
Love that Maze!
Oh, bravo, Detective
Ass saved
You're welcome
His ass, not yours
Let's go
Care to tell me what happened?
You wouldn't believe me if I did
They found a gun in Viper's bag
It's a 38 Same caliber fired at Benny's show
Um
What?
You should know something
Okay
I talked to Lucifer about you the other day
Yeah, I heard
I mean, not that it got me anywhere
If anyone can handle themselves around that wack job, it's you
And, hey, it looks like, uh
you got the bad guy
Yeah
Looks like
What, no "thank you"?
I don't know why you're upset
I helped save kids
And we arrested our shooter
One might say I did you a favor
Hmm
Yeah, I think I just figured it out, why you do these favors
- Oh, really? - Mm-hmm
It's about power
It makes you feel superior
In control
You're addicted to creating chaos and seeing where the chips fall,
to hell with the consequences
It's like you have some kind of god complex
I most certainly do not
You do a favor for one person, someone else suffers
When you gave Benny that favor,
you damned Viper to prison
Twice
Whether he's guilty or not
What?
Stop staring
You're having another one of those "gut feelings," aren't you?
Like you had on the Palmetto case
This has nothing to do with Palmetto
Au contraire
I think it has everything to do with it
See? Addicted to creating chaos, talking out of your ass
Like I said: you were trusting your instincts
on that case, just like you're trusting them now
I mean, why would a seasoned parolee bring a gun to a children's art class?
For all we know, Mr Viper is innocent
I am innocent, man!
See?
What do you know? Our suspect has ears
Let's see if he has a conscience, as well, shall we?
Mr Viper
Mr Viper
Hello
You've already wasted so much of your life
What do you desire to do with the rest of your time on Earth?
All I want to do is my art
I swear I didn't shoot up Benny's show
If I hated him so much, why would I bother to go after him and miss?
Oh
Yes, he's got a point, actually
I mean, to pop off in a crowd like that and not hit anyone,
he'd have to be the worst shot in the world
Or the best
Steady on, Detective
It's my Pig Diddy piece
Collector in Dubai offered me 150 G's for it
I want you to have it
As thanks for saving my life
Again
Yes, my favor really did pay off for you, didn't it, Benny?
You're a huge star
But if there's one thing the Devil abhors, it's a fake
What are you talking about?
I'm all about authenticity
Sure Except for the lying
You failed to inform me that in getting you off the B&E charge,
suspicion would immediately fall on your best friend
I had no control over that
Didn't you?
Oh
Hey, it's good to see you, man
I missed you, bro
That why you never came to visit me in prison?
I wish I could've done more
Framing him for shooting up your fashion show surely didn't help
Viper was always the real talent
When you heard he was getting released, you tried to take down the competition
before he could take down you
Planned a simple frame job
Parole violation that would send Viper back to prison
But when Paola Cortez died, you had to improvise, didn't you?
You knew pointing the fingers at Latin Kings would eventually get back to me
How the hell could I have staged that frame job?
How could I have pointed a gun at myself?
Because you didn't pull the trigger
So many bullets fired into that crowd
How did no one get hit?
That takes precision
I saw your Marine tattoo when I met you, Hector
A heart in crosshairs Sniper unit
Best marksmen in the world
Did you know firing a gun into a crowd is a felony?
You're responsible for Paola's murder
Unless, of course, you were just doing someone a favor
- No, man Hey - Benny made me do it! I'll testify, man
He told me he'd make me a partner
But then he made me plant the gun on Viper
And kill Pig Diddy
I loved that pig, man
Oh
Well, the good news is that whilst all dogs go to Heaven,
you'd be surprised how many pigs are waiting for you in Hell
Okay, let's go
You were never good as me, man
You were never good as me, man!
- Never! - What?
I don't think so, Sonny G
Not my
Mm
I'm no expert on LA street art, but it's funny
this piece seems a lot more authentic to me now
I think I'll keep it
We're here live at the location of the impromptu shrine
for Paola Cortez, the young art school student killed at the fashion show
for artist/designer Benny Choi,
who has been arrested for the killing
Can we start, please? Excuse me
Yes, ma'am
Thank you
The mother
of Paola Cortez can rest a little easier tonight,
knowing that her daughter's killer is behind bars
The arrest of Benny Choi and several of the Latin Kings membership
is a reminder that my LAPD
means justice for all
You know, I'd love to make that woman cry for real
She's gonna be chief of police because of you
Mm
I don't know how you do it
I simply made good on a favor
- Aren't you the little saint? - Oh, no, no
This time, I called in my IOU
Olivia got what she wanted, and I got what I wanted
Oh, don't say it Come on, don't say it
I am now an official civilian consultant for the LAPD
- Oh - Not that there's anything civil
about the Devil
What fun would that be?
Okay, then
You win
We're partners
What, you're not going to protest?
Actually, no
I may have no idea what your angle is, but
at least now I can keep my eye on you
Keep your enemies close, right?
Close?
So does this mean you're gonna take me home
and consummate our new arrangement, then, Detective?
Oh
I'll take that as a yes
Seriously?
What, you're just gonna leave me here?
In this part of town?
You said you wanted danger
What?
Detective! Detective!
I don't even have a phone!
Ah, well
That's just marvelous, isn't it?
Humanity tested,
homicide solved,
gangbanger attire dissected
Although, that one I still have questions about
Anyway, cheers
To you, Maze, for saving my mortalized ass
Cheers
Yes, you may have a point about the dangers of becoming mortal
There are consequences
I need to be careful
Yes, you do
Yes, after all, I almost got our pet detective killed
Oh, Mazie
I know that you'll always protect me
No matter how mortal I become, the Devil can depend on that
Yes, you can
Whatever the danger, I'll be there to stop it
Whether you see it coming or not
That's my Maze
Okay
Hello?
Hello?

Oh, don't say it Come on, don't say it
I'm now an official civilian consultant for the LAPD

Then give me something that I can use against Lucifer,

He doesn't confide in me anymore
But there is someone he does talk to a doctor
Hello there, neighbor
I actually need someone to confide in about a patient
And hey, listen, if you have any patients
- you need to talk about - You have no idea
Just shoot me, Detective, please,
because maybe you'll finally realize
You're bleeding
What's happening to me?
You're changing, becoming vulnerable
Maybe even mortal
Oh, Mazie I know that you'll always protect me

What container?
The container
Your return to the Underworld

Remind Dad
that I quit Hell because I was sick and tired 
of playing a part in His play 
CHLOE: There was a case, a shooting on Palmetto Street 
Malcom got shot 
meeting up with some gang members
Paolucci thinks he took the bullet like a hero
I think he was on the take
Now, 
no one wants to work with me
You give me what is mine!
Oh, God
Who stole them?
They were yours
No, don't!
LUCIFER: Someone's got them, 
Mazikeen 
Someone's got my wings

Previously on Lucifer 
Ooh! How's your ex, Detective Douche?
Is this the fight that you want to pick?
You stuck your neck out on Palmetto
- Look where that got you - Okay
Chloe, you are stabbing hard
at something that's just not there
There's got to be an explanation
for what I saw, Dan
There has to be!
Chloe, this could mean
a lot of things
It means a cop knew
this secret passageway existed, Dan
- What is it? - A 999 key
LAPD issued I was right
It's my duty to return the wings where they belong
Doesn't part of you long
to assume your form?
Not exactly
I want what's best for Lucifer
Then give me something
that I can use against Lucifer, and I'll make
sure you're both back where you belong
That's the problem
He doesn't confide in me anymore
But there is someone he does talk to
A doctor
Hello there, neighbor
I actually need someone to confide in
about a patient
And, hey, listen,
if you have any patients
you need to talk about
You have no idea
Lovely Thanks, girls
Ooh!
We'll have to try that later
Brian! Cheers!
Maze! You haven't wished me happy birthday
The Devil doesn't have a birthday
Well, I do now
I burned my wings
I feel reborn
It's my re-birthday party
Reborn? As who?
Whoever the hell I want to be
It's exciting, isn't it?
Ha-ha
To new beginnings
Happy birthday to me
Oh, how sweet
She brought a date
You said "drinks with a few friends"
Well, you know, things got out of hand
Just the way I like it
We brought you a birthday gift
Is that the royal "we"?
Whiskey with a pickle juice chaser
It's our station's birthday tradition
Lovely! How can I refuse?
Can I refuse?
Of course you can
And we'll always think less of you
Here's to another trip around the sun
Cheers
Ah! Ooh!
It's not bad, is it?
Briny!
Let's find Maze
She needs to try this bizarre concoction
She loves a salty aftertaste
No We're just stopping by
We have a department thing to go to
Some of us work for a living
Well, that's your bad luck, isn't it?
Come on, the party's barely started
Happy birthday, Lucifer
You sure you want to be here?
We can't be the only ones
missing Malcolm's welcome back party
If we want to find a dirty cop,
we got to look like team players
Chloe Decker!
Here we go
You and I need to talk
Sure, Malcolm
You back with this guy?
Hmm?
How-how, how long was I out?
What, you get the sense knocked out of you, Decker?
- We're just, we're just - You know, we have
Just relax, guys
I'm just just giving you a hard time
You finally got your sense of humor back, huh?
Yeah, he's healing fast
Doc said he should be able
to get rid of this chair in a couple days
You tired of pushing me around, Paolucci?
Look at that, huh?
The partner who will not die
Guess Heaven didn't want him
and Hell couldn't keep him
You got no idea
So I, I may have been
out of line last time I was here
But I did send flowers
And chocolates
And now myself, so, save the best gift till last
Not enough? No?
You can invite a friend
Why did you think I'd be mad?
Was it because of this?
I've found women, generally,
don't like a man punching holes in things, yes
Lucifer, our last session was a breakthrough
It was?
You're finally getting in touch with your emotions
Letting your barriers down
You see, that's part of the problem
I'd like them back up, thank you
Why?
Well, because these emotions
are bloody inconvenient, that's why
What's bothering you right now?
Well
right now I'm experiencing a very odd feeling
It's-it's like a
it's like a fat man sitting on my chest
But not in a fun way
And when is that happening?
Well, um
When you're with Chloe?
Yes
Well, actually, lately, when she's been with Dan
Her ex
Well, sort of Uh
I don't know what she sees in that oaf
Lucifer
you're jealous
The Devil doesn't get jealous
I'm the one who inspires passion in others
I mean
you know that
Mm, don't I ever
Thank you
That's the appropriate response
Hold on, maybe it's not me
Maybe it's her
You could fix the detective
How would I do that?
Well, heal her douche fixation, obviously
Then she stays away from her ex
Then I get my partner back
That's not how therapy works
We deal with your issues
Not someone else's
Oh, dear! Someone's session went poorly
Mm Thanks for gracing us with your presence
Yes, I had a previous engagement
Therapy twice in one day So LA of me
Dr Bernie Shaw Killed last night
No forced entry
Killer most likely knew the vic
The weapon was improvised
Seems like a crime of passion
Right Yeah
Have you ever seen a therapist?
You know, for your pent-up anger and your trust issues
And your attraction to very dull men
Let's just focus on the case, shall we?
Well, I will, once it's interesting
Oh! Hello
It's interesting "The Cheater Therapist"
Yeah, he encouraged couples to cheat to save their marriages
You can imagine how many people want to kill him
I can't, actually Sounds like a great idea
You don't save a marriage by sleeping with other people
It can't hurt to try
Pretty sure it can
That's the wife Alexandra
She was out of town and just got back
to find her husband dead
Poor woman
Excuse me!
Your husband was the Cheater Therapist
Hey, I'm not sure who you are,
but this is not the time for judgment
What? No judgment here, Tissue Lad
I think her husband's work was bang on!
I'm Detective Decker
This is my associate, Mr Morningstar
Yeah, yeah
Jonathan Medina
Colleague of Dr Shaw's
Desire shouldn't be contained it's unnatural
Your husband recognized that
Bernie, he-he just wanted to help people
He dedicated his life to others
Who would do this?
We'll find out, Mrs Shaw
Hmm?
Every one of her husband's patients is a suspect
Oh! Does that mean we get to dive into patient files?
Read the deepest, darkest secrets
of LA's most unfaithful?
No, we can't look at them without a psychologist
to protect patient confidentiality
Perfect! I have just the psychologist!
Dr Linda Martin, from our first investigation together
The one that wanted to jump your bones?
- Yeah - No Not happening
No, I really think she'd bring some
impressive insight into the issues
that you're dealing with
Uh, in the case
I really don't Plus, it's out of our hands
Court-appointed A judge needs to sign off
Wonderful! Now
I see you brought your gavel, like I asked
Oh!
Oh, objection, Your Honor
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - wwwAddic7edcom -
Ah! Now, now
Oh, come on!
I won't tell if you won't
I swore an oath to a judge
Oh, did you now?
You only get to read the files
I deem necessary for investigation
Now, remember our deal
You have to fix the detective's broken douche meter
- whilst we investigate this crime - Mm-hmm
- I never agreed to that - Oh, come now
Don't you want to help me?
Hmm? Linda?
Lucifer
Ah! Speak of the me
Out here Now
What did you do?
Not what, but who, if you must know
But I try not to kiss and tell
I told you I didn't want to go with Dr Martin
We need someone impartial, which means
not trying to get in your pants What?
Are you even listening to me?
Not really Look
A new doctor's moved in
Dr Canaan
How Biblical
Sure, let's add another random doctor to the case
Great idea
Now, look, I assure you, Dr Martin is excellent
She trained at Stanford, she lectures at USC,
she's got stacks of awards
Since when are you her fanboy?
Since I became a client
You
You're really in therapy?
Why is that so surprising?
You're the least reflective person I know
I have layers
I'm like an onion
An irresistible one
Dr Linda
said we recently made a breakthrough, in fact
Why do I think that's code for sex?
In that particular context, no
Do you still think you're the Devil?
I am the Devil
Then excuse me if I doubt her skills
Look, she's helped me, all right?
And I think she can be of help here
- Uh-huh, I'm sure - Excuse me
- Everything okay? - Yes, Linda,
everything's absolutely fine No offense, Dr Martin
I found something
- Hello - What is it?
A patient named Richard Kester
His wife convinced him to try Dr Shaw's therapy
Hmm, let me guess didn't end well?
She had an affair
They got divorced
And then Richard sent Dr Shaw a death threat
It's been more than a year, but that kind of anger
can bubble up when you least expect it
Add him to the list of angry patients
That's just it
Richard's the only one so far
Dr Shaw's patients seem remarkably happy with him
Oh, do they now?
See, cheater therapy works
Maybe you should've tried it with Detective Douche
Or was that what broke you apart?
What is wrong with you lately?
I'll look into him
Thank you
Yeah
Top work, Sherlock
So I don't understand
all this jealousy talk
I mean, why covet something someone else has?
Why not just take it?
'Cause it's never that easy
Well, it is for me
Usually
I, uh, I may have overstepped
earlier in regards to Detective Douche
Yeah
You definitely may have
So why did you two separate anyway?
The job was more important to him than me and Trixie
But lately something's changed
He he makes time for me
He makes time for us
He's really putting in an effort
Yes, if ever anyone deserved
a participation trophy, it's Dan
Decker
Uh, hello, Detective
It's about Richard
I wanted to warn you
He may be unstable
Possibly dangerous
I'll handle it, but thanks
I don't mean to you
I mean to himself
Yeah, you may be right
Lucifer?
Oh, my God
There's another one
Hey, Detective!
You need your roots done!
I've made up my mind
You can't stop me
What? Oh, no I'm not here to stop you
If you want to jump, go for it
Is this some kind of reverse psychology?
No, quite serious
Go for it
Okay, here goes
I do have one question before you pop off
You see, I'm trying to understand jealousy
It's a new concept to me
And you, dear Ricky, are the perfect person to explain it
- What are you talking about? - Manners, Ricky
Manners!
We're not done talking yet!
Okay, I'll talk!!
Pull me back up, please!
Are you sure? Yeah? 'Cause I could just
Pull me back up!
Pull me up, please!
Oh, God
I'd save your breath if I were you
When it comes to this sort of thing, he's quite judgy
Right, back to the matter in hand
Now, you were so jealous that you murdered Dr Shaw
Can you help me understand why?
How could you say that?
I was about to jump, because he's dead
Don't fib, Rickster
I know about your death threats
I was in a bad place
Kara had just dumped me
I made my threats
Then I went to his office
And killed him
And he talked me down
And afterwards, he kept seeing me,
even though he knew I couldn't afford to pay him
I mean, he'd got me through my divorce, bankruptcy,
the death of my parrot
Oh, I've just realized
you're not jealous, are you?
You're just sad
Pathetic, really
Well, if you can't tell me what I need to know,
what good are you?
Aren't you supposed to tell me that I have a lot to live for?
Well, I wish I could, Ricky,
but your life sounds incredibly bleak
Ironically, it seems there's nowhere to go but up
You know what? You're right
Hmm?
Maybe the worst is behind me
Hmm
I think I'm ready to go in now
Well, I wasn't asking, but, uh,
all right, go on, quick as you can
Come on, chop, chop
I can't believe you, Lucifer
What? You should be thanking me
All right, Richard, we confirmed your alibi with your neighbor
You're free to go
How did this happen?
Poor Sandy
Who's Sandy?
Dr Shaw's wife, Alexandra
Her friends all call her Sandy
Okay, and you're friends with your therapist's wife?
Yes, how open was his relationship therapy, hmm?
No, it's nothing like that
That's just how the Shaws are
They go above and beyond
I just ran into her two days ago
Sandy was planning a surprise
for Dr Shaw and everything
You ran into her two days ago are you sure about that?
Yeah
Alexandra told us she was in Phoenix
We checked her alibi
She had plane tickets to prove it
What was the surprise?
I don't know
She just asked me not to tell Dr Shaw she was in town
Uh-huh
You can't think she did this?
We're closed
You must be Maze
You're just as Lucifer described
So, you're the doctor
Oh, call me Linda
Pleasure to meet you
I've seen that look in women before
Won't end well
What won't?
Sleeping with my boss
You'll end up like all the others
Trash left by the side of the road
Interesting
What?
Well, I find people who are rude
usually feel powerless in their own lives
Terrified of not being in control
But that's not you, I'm sure
I like you
Doctor?
What a surprise
What are you doing here?
I thought you asked me to meet you here
That-that was me I felt like
it would be good to get your input on the case
That's a good idea, actually, especially
since our last suspect almost ended up sidewalk art
Turns out Mrs Shaw flew to Phoenix
but rented a car and drove back a couple days early
So, dear, sweet Sandy was here
just in time for the murder
Wait, Alexandra Shaw goes by "Sandy"?
The doctor had a female patient who was stalked
by someone with the initials SS
He used initials in his notes?
I found it odd as well
Why conceal someone's identity in private notes?
But I thought it wasn't related, so I
Unless SS stands for Sandy Shaw
If she was stalking
one of her husband's female patients
Then maybe Dr Shaw
was engaged in his own
open-relationship therapy
Sandy found out
So maybe she wasn't
okay with it as she claimed
Excuse me
Decker
Yeah, this is 831
Oh, yeah, tell him I'll be there as soon as I can
Okay, thank you
That was dispatch
Dan's phone died,
and he wants me to meet him at my place
Apparently it's urgent
Oh, how convenient
What's next he spills something on his shirt
and he has to take it off?
Oh, no, the trousers, too
- What? - What, so that's it?
You just go running as soon as Dan calls?
What about the case?
This could relate to another case I'm working on
There's units looking for Sandy now
And once they find her, they'll call me
Bye
Bye
Unbelievable
You see what I'm dealing with now, don't you?
I think I do, actually
It's worse than I realized
Thank you
Hey, Dan
What did you find out?
Surprise
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey! I just wanted to talk
You act all chummy in public,
then you break into my home,
trick me into meeting you in private?
Excuse me if I'm not trusting
Hey, I'm not armed
All right? Hey
Huh? It's nothing like that
All right
Then talk
I had to meet with you where no one else could hear
Hear what my screams?
Decker, we're on the same side
And I know you're still looking into Palmetto
Well, guess what? So am I
I put that to bed a long time ago
That the best you got?
God, you're a decent cop, but you are a terrible liar
Come on!
Palmetto stinks
I should know I was there
Mm-hmm
Go ahead, say it
I look dirty
I saw you meet with Nikolas Aoudi
You were laughing
I saw you hand him cash
I've used him as a CI before
I was buying information
Then we both got shot
And I think it was a cop who shot me
But you knew that already, didn't you?
Why do you think it was a cop?
That's what I was paying Aoudi for
Intel on someone crooked at our station
But I think he or she got to me first
That's
that's a great story
I love the ending
It-it ties up all the loose ends
Not really
I can't explain
how the crooked cop knew I was there
How'd you find me?
I followed the smell
You followed the
You know what?
Screw this
I only called you to try and help
Really?
Yeah, really
Listen, Decker, they pulled the plug on me
Malcolm
I was dead
I-I know
Made me appreciate the time I've got here
So, personally, I don't think
I'm gonna dig any deeper on this one
And I wouldn't if I were you either
Not sure if that's a warning or a threat
I'm not the enemy, Chloe
But whoever we were investigating,
they're still out there
And they clearly don't have a problem shooting cops
Decker
Unis found Sandy Shaw
in her car in a parking structure
Oh, well, I hope our case
didn't ruin your kissy-time with Dan
What is with your recent obsession with my love life?
Obsession?
That's awfully defensive
Probably indicates deeper issues, wouldn't you say?
I agree
Why are you so defensive, Lucifer?
Good question
Et tu, Doctor?
Lucifer, you asked me to analyze the situation
No, I asked you to help figure out what's wrong with her
Did you now?
But
Nothing's wrong with her
She's a woman balancing a lot on her plate,
and, as far as I can tell, doing a fantastic job
Why, thank you
You're right, Lucifer, she's amazing
No, she's verbal Ebola
Where's the button to put the glass up?
This isn't a limo, Lucifer
And, Dr Linda,
you should really join us more often
Getting double-teamed is usually much more fun than this
Mm
Gross
So you lied to us
You were in town the day your husband died
Yes But it's not what you think
Okay, then help me understand
Sandy, I'm on your side
Not everything stems from jealousy,
no matter what these women tell you
Hey, Lucifer
You came here driven by some kind of desire, didn't you?
No
Come on
You can tell me What was it?
It's disgusting
Ooh, you naughty girl
Come on, now you have to tell me
It's in my car
What is, Sandy?
Poop
Oh
Bags and bags of it
Oh, my God
I'm not sure whether to be horrified or impressed
My friend owns a horse
That's oddly comforting to know
What were you gonna do with it?
I was going to throw it at Tiffany
That's the patient
you were accused of Stalking
Yeah
She's in a group therapy session right now
for my husband's clients
Group cheater therapy
Oh, the imagination runs wild
So Tiffany was sleeping with your husband
She was
How'd you find out?
My husband's colleague, Dr Medina, called me
Okay, so he told you that your husband was cheating?
No, he had no idea
He just called to see
if Bernie wanted to grab a last-minute drink
But Bernie was supposed to already be with Dr Medina
That's when I knew my husband lied to me
But he was the cheater therapist
I don't quite see the problem here
I mean, you said yourself
The problem is he fell in love with her
I lied to him about my trip,
then I drove back from Phoenix to see what he was doing
I was
Don't say it
Jealous
Yes, yes, we all get it!
Jealousy makes the world go
I mean, what are you, a girl band?
I loved him
Oh
I didn't kill him
I just wanted him back
Oh, great
- The douche-mobile - Give me a second
Hey, I got your text You okay?
Did Malcolm hurt you?
No I told you, it's-it's fine
Everything's fine
I'm gonna punch that son of a bitch right back into a coma
Oh, come on
No No
Anything back on the 999 key?
I'm sorry, Chloe
They couldn't get any prints off of it
Thanks
So that's Dan, huh?
Yes
Numbingly average, isn't he?
I wouldn't say that
What You're supposed to be on my side, you know
No I'm supposed to help you process your emotions
so you can deal with them constructively
Yes, by being on my side and realizing that I'm right
Lucifer
Is over this conversation
I'm gonna go and talk
to some people who are a little more open-minded, Doctor
Hi I'm Dr Medina Thank you for coming
All right, looks like we have everyone,
so let's start
Yes! That's a great idea
There's so very much to discuss
So let's start with the most important thing, shall we?
Me
And once again,
Lucifer disappears
I think the case may have hit a little too close to home
Maybe things got a little too boring
for Mr Short Attention Span
I don't know
He's grown quite a bit since working with you
I'm not sure I'm the reason
I think you've really helped him
I underestimated you before I'm sorry
Not needed But thank you
And I thought
I thought you were sleeping with him
Oh, I am
Oh Oh
Is, um is that?
Ethical?
- Mm-hmm - No
No, it is not
But there's something about him
I can't stop myself
But I think it's time I did
I mean, even I'm starting to feel
So do you think she did it?
Sandy claims she was sitting outside Tiffany's house,
waiting for Dr Shaw to show up
Problem is, no one can corroborate her alibi
But, no, I don't think it was her
So there's no one in Dr Shaw's files that looked like
a potential suspect?
Not that I can tell, but maybe I missed something
What?
The cheater therapist turned out to be terrible at cheating
Why didn't he tell Dr Medina he was using him as a cover story?
Maybe he did
Maybe he confided in Dr Medina
But Mrs Shaw said that Dr Medina
had no idea about the affair
Yeah, so he conveniently told her
everything she needed to know to figure it out
We need to talk to Dr Medina
Which brings us to today,
where we find Mrs Shaw
with a bag of excrement in her boot
Sorry, trunk
And somehow, out of all that,
they've decided that I'm jealous
So what do you think?
Huh?
Yes
So, wait, you're the Devil?
Yes, yes
Please keep up Anyone You
When you say you, uh, burned your wings,
was that a metaphor?
Not focusing on the right details!
Uh, yeah
She was gonna throw poop at me?
God, this isn't about you, Tiffany
All right?
Huh, no wonder you're all in therapy
All right, this is supposed to be a grief therapy session
for the patients of Dr Shaw
And everyone here has a terrible loss to deal with
What, and I don't?
I've lost both my therapist and my partner
I'm s
Th-They died?
No No, they turned on me
Some would argue that's worse
All right, you need to leave
No, I'm close to something I can feel it
This is not about you!
Gah
You're right
Yes
I should use one of you as a case study
Thank you for volunteering
So what
what makes you jealous? Hmm?
What do you desire that you can't have?
Come on
I
Yeah?
I want Sandy
What?
Oh
I remember you now
Tissue Lad!
Wanted some open relationship therapy of your own, is that it?
That's not what it is like
But she didn't want you, did she?
Sandy loved her husband,
so you killed him, didn't you?
Shut up!
Solved it, haven't I?
Eh?! Haven't I?
So that's a yes
He's got a knife!
Do you realize what you've done?
I had to kill him, all right?
He lied to her He cheated on her
And I tried to tip her off, but no matter what he did,
she still loved him
No, no, not that
This Right here
You've just given me the perfect example of unbridled jealousy
I'm not jealous I'm not
The woman that you loved was with someone else,
someone you thought wasn't worthy of her
But no matter what you did
she never saw you the way you wanted her to
That's
That's pretty accurate
Yeah
You've just made me realize something
That my situation and yours are
absolutely nothing alike
I was right! Not jealous!
Drop your weapon!
- Ow! - Ooh
Did you seriously
just bite me?
He's the killer
Yeah, you think?
So you were right about Linda
She helped me figure out the motive
And then I realized Jonathan and Dr Shaw's offices
shared the same security system
So I checked and
You're not listening to me, are you?
Afraid not
You didn't see any similarity
between yourself and Jonathan?
So you heard some of that, did you?
Tail end
I don't know
Did you?
Mm-mm No
Completely different
That's what I thought
So how's your secret case with Dan going?
Secretly terrible
Do you remember Malcolm?
Coma boy?
He woke up
He claims he's innocent
Something he said bothers me
Whoever shot him knew about Palmetto,
but he says that no one should have known he was there
Well, you found him there
Yeah, I He pointed that out, too
So, whoever followed him could have done what I did
So how did you track him?
Partners on the force share GPS locators in their gear
so that they can find each other in emergencies
You hacked his partner's locator
Which means
Malcolm's partner knew he was there, too
Tony Paolucci knew
That's Paolucci's car, just like his GPS said
But the bar's closed
Maybe he decided to keep the party going
You have to stop doing that
It was unlocked
Paolucci, you in here?
At least you can see what he was thinking
Dan
I found a suicide note
In his handwriting?
Sure looks like it
Apparently, he was on the take
Malcolm was onto him, so Paolucci shot him
When Malcolm woke up,
Paolucci couldn't take the guilt anymore
You okay?
Paolucci was an ass,
but this I can't imagine this
I know
I know
Uh, come in
Hello, Doctor
Thank you for coming
Uh, I know we're not due for a session for a few days
No, my bad
I realize I'm not up to date on my payments, so
Uh
don't
What's wrong? Nothing's wrong
I realized a few things
As I said,
we made a breakthrough
And I think, with that in mind,
we should keep our relationship professional from now on
Oh
Are you sure?
Very much so
Very well
If, uh if you think it's best
I do
Right
Well, I'll, um see you at my next session, then
- One last thing before I go - Yes?
Dr Canaan down the hall what's he like?
Uh, thoughtful
Spiritual Why?
Little sanctimonious?
I don't know I suppose
Six-foot-two, black, voice like an angel?
Oh, you know him
All too well
Trixie's finally down
She conned you into reading the book
about the sneezing panda, didn't she?
Five times
Hey Um
thank you
For what?
You know, for having my back and
for everything
You're welcome
For everything
You should go
Yeah, I should
I'm sorry
No Don't be sorry
All right
Okay
Bye
Evening, Dan
I got your text
What do you want?
Just wanted to congratulate you on closing Palmetto
You and that smart, sexy lady of yours
caught the guy who shot me
That's what the confession said, right?
How long did it take you to write it?
Forever I mean, I'm so not a word guy
You know?
What? You should be thanking me
Why is that?
Well, I could have told everyone the truth
that you shot me
Why didn't you?
'Cause I like you
And I can't imagine what would happen to your life
if people found out the truth
Your colleagues, your ex
- I swear to God, I will - What? Shoot me?
Ah, been there, done that
Big fail
Besides, you wouldn't want anything
to mess with your pretty little family
now that you're working to fix things, right?
Whatever you want to do to me,
- you keep them out of it - Dan
Come on
I'm not gonna hurt anyone
No
No, no, no, no, no
You you and I
we're gonna be best friends
Yeah
Because I got big plans for you
Big plans
Fun, right?
We're having fun now
I just learned the strangest thing
Spoiler alert, Amenadiel found Dr Linda
He was an angel on her shoulder, trying to control me
I wonder how my dear, angelic brother
got such a wickedly clever idea
I did it to protect you
I told you,
whatever the danger, I'll be there to stop it
Whether you see it coming or not
You betrayed me, Maze
And not for my own good
You did it for yourself
Who is this human world really rubbing off on, eh?
Me or you?
- Lucifer, I - Ah
Don't want to hear it
'Cause you and me, we're done

Previously on Lucifer 
Thank you for having my back and for everything
I could have told everyone the truth
You shot me
Why didn't you?
'Cause I got big plans for you
You betrayed me, Maze
- Lucifer, I - I don't want to hear it
We're done
It seems I'm dealing with a bit
of a mortality sitch
I'm bleeding
I'm just realizing the gravity of what you're saying
That I'm allergic to lead projectiles?
All I have to do
is wait for some pitiful thug
to end you
And right back to Hell you go
People come to me to ask for favors, and more often than not,
- I'm happy to oblige - What do you get?
A devilish IOU, if you will
Who would take a deal like that?
They all do
Yeah, fantastic!
You're here
Ah, starving! Can't think why!
Okay
Thank you
Uh, this should, uh,
well, this should just about cover it
Have a nice evening
Oh, curious
In your line of work, how many times has it happened to you?
You know, like in those wonderful Internet videos?
Your deliveries ending in sex
Uh
never
Well, that changes tonight
Come!
Come on! Come, come!
Come
I'm still on the clock
Oh, you'll always be on the clock
But how often will you be here?
Hey? Oh, Brittanies!
Brittanies,
- Yeah! - Pizza delivery guy
Pizza delivery guy, Brittanies
Hi!
Well, go on
What are you waiting for?
- Have fun - Come on!
Lucifer!
Come join us
Be right there, darlings
All right
But I didn't
join them
Three Brittanies in the Jacuzzi
Three
Why didn't I join them?
Why do you think you didn't join them?
I don't know, Doctor That's what I pay you
to figure out, isn't it?
Have you ever considered that all of this excessive partying
may be your attempt to fill a void?
"Attempt"?
I filled five voids last night
That's not what I mean
A void in your emotional life
You sound
lonely
"Lonely"?
Have have you been listening to a word I've said?
I am never alone
I'm constantly surrounded by people
You know? I party whenever I desire
My bed never cold
Lucifer, being alone
and being lonely are two entirely different things
- Are they? - Yes!
You may be surrounded by others,
but do you truly consider any of those people
your friend?
My friend?
A peer you respect
Someone you like to spend time with
Someone with whom you share a meaningful connection
Well, you and I connect quite well
I'm talking personal
What about Maze?
No
She and I are on the outs, I'm afraid
Long story filled with betrayal
You actually make a cameo in it
How about Detective Decker?
Do you consider her your friend?
Well, quite honestly, I
I'm not sure what we are
Lucifer?
Listen, can we tal?
I don't have time for traitors
I get you don't want to talk to me
But someone else is here to see you for a favor
Not in the mood, Maze
Trust me
You don't want to miss this one
You wanted to speak with me?
Lucifer Morningstar
Father Frank Lawrence
A priest walks into a bar
I've heard this one before Never seen it, though
At least not here
Padre, how did you
of all people find me?
Don't let the collar fool you
I have friends from all walks of life
People who tell me
you're the man to see when you run out of options
Ooh, what kind of nasty trouble
have you gotten yourself into then?
Pinched too much from the collection basket?
I'm here about a neighborhood youth center
Sounds dreadful
It is When you realize
it's being used as a front for an illegal drug operation
The center's director,
Lenny Arietta, is recruiting kids from my church to move his product
Ah, so this is about young boys, of course it is
One in particular
A kid named Connor
He's had it rough
Lost both his parents at six
Bounced from home to home, some juvie
But deep down, a good kid
So, diddling this one, are you?
How about I not dignify that with an answer,
and instead ask my favor?
I was wondering when you'd get to it
I want you to talk to Arietta
before Connor gets involved
And why not go to the police?
Got something to hide, do you?
They were useless
Couldn't find anything on Arietta
Why not ask your boss then, hey?
The Almighty Himself
I already have
Oh, no luck?
On the contrary,
I believe he led me to you
I highly doubt that
So that's it, is it?
Stop a drug ring to help some kid get out of trouble
What's in it for you?
What is it you really want?
That dirty dark desire I can
see you struggling to hold in
What I really want
Yeah?
is to put my fist through Arietta's face
Ha!
And there it is
Wrath
Ooh, not so high and mighty now, are you?
We all have demons inside
My demon tends the bar
So come on, what else are you hiding?
Hypocrites like you always have something
- You don't know anything about me - Oh, I know plenty
You and I are natural sworn enemies
So, you gonna help me or not?
My answer to you, Father,
is a big fat no
Handle it yourself
You're lucky I don't have any active cases,
or else I'd send this to Narcotics
"Narcotics"? No, no, no, no
I don't give a damn about the drug dealer
We're here to investigate the priest
Priest?
I thought we were here to talk to the youth director
We are To get dirt on the priest
He must be hiding something
And what better to way to stick it to dear old Dad
than prove that those who speak on His behalf
aren't as virtuous as they pretend to be
You thought it'd be a good idea
to rope me into your imaginary family feud?
Great
Look, am I mistaken or do you catch bad guys?
Now, this priest is up to something
Something nefarious I can feel it
Last I checked, your feelings don't count as probable cause
Well, isn't the fact that he came to me
probable cause enough?
Or I could just interrogate
this youth director by myself
No, just let me do the talking
Mr Arietta?
Hmm
Well, if I were trapped in here with these vile children,
I'd lock my door as well
Detective
He's dead
Wow
Told you the priest was up to something
Synced and corrected by oykubuyuk wwwaddic7edcom
ME puts the time of Arietta's death between 11:30 and 12:00 this morning
'Cause was multiple hits with a baseball bat
There are some abrasions on his face
So it looks like he struggled before he died
And I found this
Ooh, what's that?
It's a voice modulator Hey, can you not do that?
Detective, I am your father
It's not a toy, Lucifer
It could be evidence
Well, I'm impressed
Looks like the priest handled it himself after all
- We don't know the priest did this - Well, maybe you don't
Detective Decker?
Hold on
Oh, can you take that?
Yeah Thank you
Hey, you're the head counselor, right?
Uh, yeah
Um, Eric Doyle
Any idea who might've done this?
No
I mean, everyone liked Lenny
He was a good boss
So, he had no enemies whatsoever, no?
Especially any who wear clerical collars?
- So you know about the priest - Oh, yes
Yeah, that guy's always coming around here
and getting into arguments with Lenny
Hmm
But he's a priest
Right
Mr Doyle, where were you between 11:30 and 12:00 this morning?
Uh here
In counseling sessions with, uh, Nikki and Connor
Connor?
Well, that's the altar boy from the priest's photo
So, is it, is it true
Mr Arietta's dead?
Well, duh, dumb-ass
It is Yeah
Did you know him well?
A little, I guess
He, he, I mean, he ran the place
Do you know if Mr Arietta was involved in any drug activity?
Drugs?
I mean, I wish he was
That would've made him more interesting
Okay
Enough about the dead guy
Tell me everything you know about Padre Pederast
Who?
Father Frank
Did you see him do this?
Do you think he's capable?
Father Frank kill Mr Arietta?
Yes
No No way
What do you mean "no way"?
The guy's a creeper and totally obsessed with you
He's just overprotective
Ever since my parents died,
he feels like he's got to watch out for me or something
But he's a good guy
He's just a little
just a little annoying
- See? - Hmm?
Annoying
Mm-hmm
When was the last time you saw him?
Uh, he Here this morning
Yeah, preacher seemed pretty pissed
Oh
Uh, wait, you don't really think
that, like, Father Frank did this, right?
- 100% - Thank you
You've been very helpful
Right
See? Told you
No, I hate to admit it, but you might be on to something
Sorry, what was that?
You might be on to something
That's him
Frank Lawrence
The most evil of people have the most normal names,
I've experienced
Beware anyone named Keith
Well, his criminal record's pretty extensive
Assault and battery, disorderly conduct,
- drug charges - See?
Not very priest-like
But nothing in the past ten years
Ah, restraining order filed by Lenny Arietta last week
Ah, well, it's funny how Padre Punchy
failed to mention a restraining order
Please tell me now we have enough
to bring this priest down
We have enough to bring him in
You ready to go to church?
Bringing down a priest is the only reason I ever would
In Bring him in
Yes, bring him in so we can bring him down
Hey, um, you go ahead
I'll I'll meet you downstairs
Just something I got to do first
Hey, so I'm in the middle of something,
but I haven't seen you all week
Are we gonna talk about what happened?
What?
Our kiss, Dan
It's kind of a big deal
Right, I'm sorry, Chloe
I've had a lot on my mind
Yeah You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine
But we should talk
About everything
Just not here
Okay, do you want to do dinner at my place, get takeout?
Yeah Zhang Chow's?
Zhang Chow I was just gonna say that
Yeah, all right
Sounds good
- Talk to you later - Yeah
Oh, how's it going, buddy?
Malcolm, what are you doing here?
Oh, you didn't hear the good news?
Back on duty
So soon after, um?
What, my partner's suicide?
Yeah, can't let that keep me down, am I right?
But don't worry
I already got a new partner
Yeah, convinced the higher-ups to give me my first choice
You
Oh, my God
Seriously, Dan, you got to try this
What's your game, Malcolm?
Partners? Are you kidding me?
Oh, well, what better way to keep an eye on you, am I right?
I saw you talking to Decker
You want to tell her, don't you?
What, that I'm the one who shot you?
Why would I do that?
Your conscience
I know you, Danny Boy
You forget, this ain't the first time we've been partners
I looked the other way a few times
- That didn't make us partners - Sure, it did
Yeah, and it ate away at you
until you finally had enough at Palmetto
I didn't have a choice
No, I-I understand No, I get it, I get it
No, you were just protecting that wife of yours
She saw me, I went for my gun
Boom No, you took me out before I could take her out
No, no hard feelings
I understand
But the minute you want to come clean,
you and I we both go to jail
Hmm?
I mean, you you really want to throw away your marriage?
Watch little Trixie grow up from behind bars?
Think this through, Dan
With you gone, uh, who's gonna protect Chloe?
What do you want from me, Malcolm?
Nothing much
You're gonna go into evidence and borrow something for me
Easy peasy lemon squeezy
Knock, knock
Stay here while I look for Father Frank,
- and don't get into any trouble - It's a church!
What am I gonna do, pray too hard?
Hello
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned
It's been three hours since my last confession
Three hours?
Speedy sinner, I like it
No, I just need more guidance
I'm still having lustful thoughts about another man
Splendid
Who's the lucky fellow?
Um, my husband's limo driver
What should I do, Father?
Well, my dear, uh, you should embrace your desires
Really?
Uh, when I was here earlier, Father Frank told me
I should be faithful to my husband
Well, I don't know why you're listening to that fool
I mean, let's be honest, if you wanted to be faithful,
then you wouldn't be fantasizing about your limo driver,
- now, would you, eh? - You're right
No, no, no, no, no, don't feel bad
You have those desires for a reason
You should act on them
I mean, you can always come back here, confess,
and all will be forgiven
Isn't that how this system of yours works?
When you put it that way
Lucifer, what do you think you're doing?
For your penance, ten Bloody Marys and a good shag
I know you're there
What, are you watching over me?
Like my own guardian angel
Yeah
Grumpy guardian angel
Forgotten about our deal, Malcolm?
Because I brought you back from the dead for a single purpose
Yeah, about that, I've been meaning to ask
Why me?
- Why you? - Yeah
I mean, uh, I must be something special
for you to go to all that trouble
Come on, don't flatter yourself
You're simply in a unique position to do what I need done
'Cause I'm a cop
That, yeah
Yeah, and because I know you'll do anything
to avoid going back to Hell
Now, stop bothering me with these questions
and just get to the task I've given you
Don't you worry your shiny little head
I'm already on it, all right?
Everything's going according to plan
Don't keep me waiting
Patience is not one of my virtues
I promise you, I I got this
Mr Morningstar, surprised to see you again
Oh, I wouldn't miss this for the world
Father Frank, when was the last time you saw Lenny Arietta?
This morning
Despite the restraining order
I answer to a higher authority
Not today you don't
What happened when you saw him?
We exchanged words
Things got a little heated
What were you fighting about?
That altar boy of his, of course
Why were you fighting over Connor?
Because I'm worried that Arietta's gonna pull Connor
into his drug ring
So, what, you give him a right hook?
Sadly, I did
- And then what? - And then I left
Ooh, no, no, no, I think you skipped a part, didn't you?
You know, the part where you beat him to death
with a baseball bat?
He's dead?
Oh, Heavenly Father
Oh, come on
How gullible do you think we are?
I had troubles with the man, but he didn't deserve to die
And I certainly didn't kill him
Can you account for your whereabouts
between 11:30 and 12:00 this morning?
Uh, I was here
Taking confessions
Mrs Madison had a lot to say, took up the whole hour
By chance, does Mrs Madison have a limo driver?
She does
Damn
Just spoke to his alibi
What?
The MILF in confession
Oh, great
Yeah, as much as I'm sure that followed protocol,
I'm still gonna have to question her myself
Father, I'm gonna need you
to come into the station for a statement
Well, maybe the padre has a twin brother
who also takes confession; that way he could still be guilty
Lucifer, seriously, will you just
Get down!
And you wonder why I don't go to church
I caught a partial from the shooter's plate
Can you run this for me?
- You got it - Thank you
So I spoke to Father Frank's alibi
Checks out
He was in confession with Mrs Madison
from 11:00 to 12:00
He's not our guy
Well, maybe she's lying
I mean, you know the sort of people that go to church
Sinners
Lab results from the voice modulator came back empty
No prints, no DNA
What, so you think this shooting
and the youth director's death are connected?
We know they have at least one thing in common
Father, you will be relieved to know that no one was injured
- Oh, thank God - Please don't
You care to tell us what that was about?
The shooting?
I don't know
This wasn't a random attack
They were shooting at you
But you don't seem surprised
What aren't you telling us?
Keep your nose out of our business or else
The voice modulator from Arietta's office
You should have gone to the police with this
I assumed it was Arietta, and I'm not afraid of him
But if it's The Spider
Spider?
I've heard whispers of another dealer
trying to take over Arietta's business
People call him "The Spider"
Scary, violent reputation
Do you know who this Spider is?
I don't
You're holding something back, Father I can tell
Hmm?
I have a confession to make
Finally! Well, the truth
will set you free isn't that what your beloved book says?
I lied when I said Connor was in danger of becoming involved
He already is Dealing for Arietta
What, that's it?
Oh, please don't tell me
that's what you've been holding back all this time
Wait If Connor's already in deep,
why go to all this trouble to protect him?
He's had it rough
Thinks he can only rely on himself
He's a good kid, Detective
There's still hope for him
Father, you were today's target
We need to worry about your safety first
Do you have a place to stay?
We can offer police protection
I'm fine right here
This is my sanctuary
Well, your sanctuary just got shot
to high heaven, Padre
But if you're looking to lay low,
I believe I know just the place
Thought this might make you feel more at home, you know
Sure you did
Hey
So, partial plates from the shooter's SUV
came back with a couple matches
But this is interesting, one of them
was recently reported stolen outside the youth center
Oh, you think someone inside's responsible
I think it's too much of a coincidence not to be,
but I ordered traffic cam footage,
so hopefully it'll show us who was driving
Hopefully
Couldn't resist, huh?
Well, the man deserves some fun
Or you still want to prove he's a hypocrite
Well, what can I say?
Temptation's in my nature
Hmm
And how's that working out for you?
Padre, does this not bother you?
What can I say?
I love this song
You sure you're gonna be okay in here, Father?
This? Oh, absolutely
I grew up in places like this
Oh, I find that hard to believe
No one's born a priest
Before the cloth, I was just
Frank Lawrence, touring musician
Really?
Let me guess cowbell
Close Piano
Good old rock and roll
Opened for Dylan, Bowie, the Stones
- The Rolling Stones? - Yep
It was a crazy time, let me tell you
I was a lot like you, really
That's literally impossible
Thought the fun would never stop
Then, uh
Father, you don't have to
No, no, no, no Go on
Car accident
Ten years ago
I was traveling with Connor and his family
Uh, Connor's dad was a drummer,
we used to play together
Another car swerved into our lane and, uh
Connor lost both his parents that night
My daughter was with us, too
She didn't make it, either
Thought I'd seen some dark days
Nothing compared to losing my little girl
My heart just
cracked right open
Well, you must have been
awfully angry at your beloved God
I was so untethered
Lost
Turning to Him is what saved me
So hold on God stole your spawn
and then you decided to worship Him?
I can't really explain it,
but somehow it made me feel that she was safe
That's when I discovered my faith
The church gave me purpose
It was there that I crossed paths with Connor again
Me, a parent without a child;
him, a child without a parent
We might not always understand it,
but God has a plan
Yes I know
But why does everybody always think it's a good plan?
Please excuse me, Father
So can we just go back to this absurd notion
that you and I are in any way similar?
- You're right We're not - Thank you
I'm probably a much better piano player than you are
D-Do you know anything that doesn't
make me want to, you know, impale myself?
Like, uh
Something more upbeat
Something a bit, um
I mean, like, uh
Oh
I think I know what you mean
Something like that?
- Yeah - Okay
Father has got soul
You ain't seen nothing yet
- Oh - Yeah
- You like to take the top? - Why not?
Excuse me
Yah!
Hoo!
Oh
Hi
Hi
Yeah, well, I suppose that wasn't
completely terrible
Not completely
Um, sorry to interrupt,
but Father Frank's story about The Spider checks out,
- and I got a lead - O
So
kay
Right, well
Well, you stay here
You need the practice
I talked to Narcotics, and one of their CI's said
The Spider's rumored to hang out here
Well, I don't know why you had to bring me along
What, are you anxious to get back to your new friend?
Please
The Devil friends with a priest?
That's absurd
It's absurdly adorable
You know, it's okay to admit you like the guy
He's everything that I stand against, Detective
Yeah, well, sometimes we get along best
with the people we're most different from
What?
Hey
- Look - Oh
Little Miss Sunshine from the youth center
Yeah, Nikki
What's that she's doing?
Drug deal
And a smooth one
Maybe she's The Spider
Ooh, black widow, then Lovely
Wait
She's giving it to someone else
To Connor
Get down!
Come on!
Important police work,
get on!
Gone
Great
And why was the black widow giving her cash to altar boy?
You never want to carry
drugs and money on you at the same time
Makes you a target
Or because Connor's The Spider
Traffic cam footage
Ah, from the church shooting
So the boy the priest was trying to protect
is the one who tried to kill him?
Well, isn't that an ironic kick in the cassock
This doesn't prove Connor's The Spider
It's pretty damning, Father
And it's enough for the APB
- that just went out - Ah
Connor's been declared armed and dangerous
Armed and dangerous?
The boy needs to be helped,
convinced to turn himself in
Father, he shot at you
He fired into a room full of kids
Yes, but he shot up, didn't he?
We'll do everything we can to bring him in peacefully
If you'll excuse me, I
need some air
Uh
I have some digging to do
Will you watch over him until I get back?
What? You want me to babysit the priest?
I babysit you all the time
Need a light?
No, thanks
Quit years ago
Still enjoy the ritual, though
Always keep one on me
Please tell me you didn't come out here to talk to Him
God?
This is as good a spot as any
Right
Does He, uh
does He ever talk back?
I don't need to hear Him to hear Him
If you know what I mean
Well, yes, He never talks to me, either
Listen, um
sorry about the altar boy
Surely you know you're not to blame
I mean, some people are just beyond saving
That's where you're wrong
There's still hope for him
He shot up your church,
he's most likely running a drug ring behind your back,
and, oh, yes, killed a man
I don't believe that
Look, what if it's true?
Then he needs me even more
How can you still have faith in this boy?
God has faith in him
In all of us
Even in our darkest moments
Oh, you really believe that
I do
Why don't you?
Because He didn't have faith in me
I felt that way once, too
But now I know, deep in my heart,
God has a plan for me
Oh, His plan for me was quite clear
How do you know it's finished?
Mm
What?
One of my parishioners, uh,
a lot of them are still upset about the shooting
Excuse me
Yeah
There
I got what you wanted from evidence
Are we done?
Not by a long shot
Partner
Hey
Did you leave Father Frank upstairs?
No, he took a call
I presumed he came down here
Why would he do that?
Maze, the priest, have you seen him?
So you're talking to me now?
Have you seen him?!
He was down here on his phone
Heard him talking to someone named Connor
- He left to go meet him - He left?
Where to?
Maybe he's trying to convince Connor to turn himself in
No He's probably trying to hide the little miscreant
Put his faith in God, not the police
Why do you care about a priest?
I don't
Where would he hide him?
Somewhere he considers safe, I assume
Sanctuary
You don't want to do this
- I know you This isn't you - Sorry,
I don't have a choice, okay?
- I have to do this - I get it
You don't think you can rely on anyone else
to survive but you're not alone
I'm here for you, whenever you need me
I don't need you! Okay?
I don't need anybody!
Go on, then, shoot the altar boy
- Shh - In the leg or something, obviously
Just do it, Connor
Pull the damn trigger already
That's Eric Doyle
The counselor
That's our Spider
You know, Nikki I trust
But you?
I think you're too attached to this preacher
You're gonna have to show me
that you're not
No shot from here
I know you, Connor
That drive-by,
you intentionally missed me, didn't you?
Stop talking Please
Make him stop talking
- It's really easy - You couldn't do it then,
and you don't want to do it now
God's giving you
a second chance right here
E-Enough with the sermon, preacher!
Connor, just shoot this son of a bitch already
Just follow your heart, son
I have faith in you
I can't do it, Doyle I'm sorry
I'm sorry, too, kid
I can't allow weakness,
not when I've just taken control
No!
Father!
Hands up Get down on the ground
No, no, no, you idiot!
The bloody hell were you thinking?
This is Unit 831 at St Morgan's Church
We need two ambos, code 4
Don't go anywhere, you moron!
It's okay I'm not afraid of dying
Well, you should be It's really boring where you're headed
I hope so I've had enough excitement for one life
Stop talking like that
You've got more to do here You've got more people to annoy
Pressure on the wound
I am!
Just come on, Frank, stay with me, stay with me
Oh, uh at first
I didn't understand why God put you in my path
But then it hit me
Maybe He put me in yours
I highly doubt it
He gave up on me a long time ago
You're wrong, Lucifer
Remember
your father
has-has a plan
My father?
Yeah
You know?
Frank?
Frank!
Frank
Time to pull the legs
off The Spider
Lucifer
Lucifer, stop!
Why did you do this?
- I don't know, man - Why?!
He was bringing too much heat!
Why?! Why?!
Lucifer, stop Father Frank
wouldn't want this
Stop
Connor gave us everything
The drug front
How Doyle took on "The Spider" name
and killed Arietta to take over the business
With Connor's cooperation,
he won't do much juvie, if any at all
Maybe Father Frank was right
Maybe there's hope for him yet
You okay?
I'm fine
Good night, Detective
You
you cruel, manipulative bastard!
Was this all part of Your plan?
It's all just a game to You, isn't it?
Eh?
Well, I know punishment,
and he did not deserve that
He followed Your stupid rules
and it still wasn't good enough!
So what does it take to please You?
Break Your rules and you fall!
Follow them and you still lose?!
Doesn't matter whether you're a sinner!
Doesn't matter whether you're a saint!
Nobody can win, so what's the point?
What's the bloody point?
Dan, I know I wanted to talk, but, um
my mind, it's just
Somewhere else?
Yeah
Yeah, mine, too
Can we do this another time?
Yeah
No problem
Hi
Bit late for a new case, isn't it?
I'm not here for a case
I'm here for you
Oh
Really?
Yeah
Thought you could use a friend
Do you play?
Mm
- No No, I don't - Come on,
- you must know something - No
Uh
All right, well
let me see
- I had three years of lessons - Mm
and this is all I remember
Surely, you must be joking
All right
Mm
Ah
Mmm
Enjoying the life I gave you?
Hey
did food taste this good before I died?
'Cause I don't remember it being this friggin' delicious
I don't care what you're doing with your new life, Malcolm
except for what I've asked of you
What's taking so long?
Come on, come on, chill out, Amenadude
Here, have some waffles
Do you want to go back?
Do you want
to go back?
Because I can make that happen
Yeah
You're remembering it now, aren't you?
I bet
your 30 seconds in Hell felt like 30 years
Imagine what eternity
- would feel like - I'm sorry
Okay?
Sorry
Look
I got it
An untraceable gun
It won't come back to me
I'm ready now
So
tell me
who do you want me to kill?
His name
is Lucifer Morningstar
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
LUCIFER: Previously on Lucifer 
- So how do you afford this place? - It's my mother's
LUCIFER: Your mother's Penelope Decker,
queen of '80s cheeseball sci-fi?
You have to introduce me
So you're the doctor
You're just as Lucifer described
I like you
CHLOE: Are we gonna talk about what happened? 
Our kiss
It's kind of a big deal
Chloe, I have a lot on my mind
DAN: What do you want from me Malcolm? 
MALCOLM: You're gonna go into evidence 
and borrow something for me 
Are we done?
Not by a long shot
AMENADIEL: Enjoying the life I gave you? 
Do you want to go back? 
Who do you want me to kill?
Lucifer Morningstar
- Previously on Lucifer - You're the Lord of Hell
Amenadiel is right
you are changing
You betrayed me, Maze
- Lucifer - I don't want to hear it We're done
Enjoying the life I gave you?
Do you want to go back?
Because I can make that happen
Seems I'm dealing with a bit of a mortality sitch
I'm bleeding
All I have to do is wait for some pitiful thug
to end you, and right back to Hell you go
Who do you want me to kill?
Lucifer Morningstar deserves everything he gets,
but I can't let you kill him
It would seem that I'm saying no
Oh, God
Oh, no
No No
Oh, God
Oh, God, what have I done?
Don't worry, my father's the forgiving sort
Well, except when it comes to me
Triple espresso or hair of the dog?
No
Oh, right
Both
Please tell me, we didn't
Did we ever
And I'm pretty sure we made Rosemary's baby
Oh, Detective, it was extraordinary
The heat, the gymnastics
I mean, you had moves that made even the Devil blush
Oh, no, this is bad
Whatever happened last night,
don't tell me, I'd rather not know
What, that we didn't do the nasty?
We didn't?
Nope, I turned you down cold
You, the guy who's been trying to get me into the sack
since day one had a chance to sleep with me,
and you did?
Why-why am I naked?
What, you mean you don't remember the part
where you passed out, woke up again,
shouted at me, "It's too hot in this five-story hellhole,"
I believe it was,
then tore your clothes off and proceeded to hog the bed?
I do that Sometimes
When I'm upset
And you'd be upset, too, if your ex dumped you by text
No, I'd be relieved if Dan dumped me
Even still,
it's very out of character to see you so unhinged
And out of character for me, too
The whole "not wanting to have sex with you" thing
I mean, here's the strange part
This gave me quite a rush
Can't explain it
I've been thinking about it all night
Okay, last night was a fluke
For both of us
Never happened, leave it at that
Right
You snore, by the way
Like an Albanian field wench!
Did you finally seal the deal with your little detective?
If we were on speaking terms, perhaps I'd fill you in
Where are you going?
Why do you ask?
You still reporting back to my brother?
Lucifer
No, do me a favor, Maze
How about you let me lead my life,
and I'll let you lead yours, deal?
You can't be mad at me forever
Oh, but I can
It's one of the luxuries of being the Devil
Detective, I believe you left these
after our sleepover last night
What's the hole at the back for?
Not mine
Those are not mine
More of a commando girl
Fair enough
Dearie me
Someone woke up on the wrong side of a 38
Yeah, single gunshot wound to the chest
No wallet
Tan marks where a ring and a watch were lifted
A staircase robbery
Is that a thing now?
This is the Dunlear Foundation
They help the homeless and the underprivileged
So, who's the dashing corpse?
Tim Dunlear himself, head of the foundation,
former NBA star, notorious playboy
He was into drugs, gambling, women
My typical Wednesday
But then he left pro ball and he turned his life around
He dedicated himself to philanthropy
He was beloved
Right, bad boy turned good
It's interesting
Are you Emmett Toussaint?
You found the body?
I'm Detective Decker Can you tell us what happened?
I volunteer for the foundation's outreach program
Came here to meet him, and he was just lying here
How did you know Mr Dunlear?
He sponsored me to come to LA after the earthquake in Haiti
Tim was my mentor
Handsome and saintly
Did you see anyone else at the scene
or notice anything strange?
There was a guy outside
He ran when he saw me
I gave the cops a description
Think he was homeless
Did Mr Dunlear ever speak of a certain philanthropic high
after one of his selfless acts?
You know, for example,
say when he chose not to sleep with a drunken woman?
What?
Did I say something wrong?
We are questioning a minor
I'm sorry about your mentor
We'll call you if we have any more questions
What? I just feel quite connected
to our victim
You are nothing like Tim Dunlear
Bad boy with a heart of gold?
I am everything like Tim
May as well be solving my own murder
Only you could turn a tragic death
into an excuse to talk about you
Well, who else would I talk about?
Got these on sale
Extra strong, UV resistant,
and still 30% off
Do you really think you're gonna get away with this?
Probably not
I'll bet the SWAT team's about
to bust down the door any minute
Not like there's much else going on
in a city of four million people
As much as I hate Lucifer, I'm not gonna let you kill him
Oh, I'm not gonna do anything No Oh
But you know who would want him dead?
Someone who's jealous
Someone who hates the fact
that he's clearly got a thing for his ex-wife
Ooh
Someone whose fingerprints I put all over the murder weapon
Sound like anyone you know, Dan?
Ooh
Don't go anywhere
My husband was so generous
If they had just asked for help,
he would have given them anything
What kind of person would do something like this?
Well, how much time do you have?
Tim would be devastated to know we've got to cancel
the fund-raising gala
You're right, Kyle
Well, we wouldn't want to devastate our fallen hero
The show must go on
This is an active crime scene
We can't have an event here
No, that wouldn't be right
Well, I just happen to own
the preeminent party venue in Los Angeles
You can hold your benefit at my club
- I don't know - No, no, your husband
was a kindred spirit,
and I pledge to carry on his good work
and personally find and punish his killer
Tim always said "Tragedy brings sorrow
but also true good"
Aw
Thank you
You are so welcome
If this was a robbery, our perp's gonna want to cash in
before the cops get wind of this,
so I'll call the local pawn shops
What is with you today?
It was rather benevolent of me,
offering up Lux, don't you think?
Well, one good deed doesn't make you a saint
Well, last I counted, it was two good deeds
But, uh, I'm not feeling the same rush as before
Perhaps I'm gonna have to up my game
Whatever you say, St Lucifer
Oh, "St Lucifer"
Suits me, don't you think?
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - wwwAddic7edcom -
It's funny, I've always looked at do-gooders with pity
Little did I know their dirty secret
And what's that?
- Feels good to do good - Yes
Good deeds do bring an amount of personal satisfaction
to those who engage in them
No, but I mean it's like a literal rush, a high
Have you ever mixed cocaine and Molly with Pop Rocks?
It's nothing like that I'm just curious
So you're feeling good about not sleeping with Detective Decker
Well, yes, and offering Lux to the Dunlear Foundation,
not to mention vowing to find Tim's killer
You've identified quite strongly with this man
Yes Yes, a man of honor, principle
Hmm You like the way being good makes you feel
- Mm - But true good needs
to come from a place of selflessness, authenticity
Well, of course
I authentically want people to applaud the real me
The Devil gets a terrible rap
So you care about image, how you look to others
And you're welcome
Okay, my point is, it's wonderful that you're evolving
Right
But goodness isn't a toy
Well, the way I'm going to play with it, it is
I'm in between gigs
I'm no thief, I'm an actor, Louie DelGado
I had an arc on Party of Five, look me up
I love LA Even the homeless have an IMDb page
You care to explain why you were
caught pawning Tim Dunlear's championship ring?
Listen, more importantly, why did you take it to a pawnshop?
The Dark Web has much better margins
I swear I didn't do nothing
Witnesses put you at the scene
You're telling me this wasn't a robbery gone wrong?
He was already dead, been like that for a bit
Rigor mortis had set in
I also did a guest spot on CSI
Ah
Tim was my buddy,
one of the few people who treated me like a human being
Would your buddy have approved of you stealing valuables
from his cold dead corpse?
Tim didn't care about stuff
Would have wanted me to have that ring
Give you the shirt off his back
What about his wallet?
Uh, I was gonna return that
Some kind of key card
I have an alibi
I was at a shelter on 7th
Uh-huh Keep an eye on Louie
I'm gonna see if his story checks out
I also know what it's like to be without a home
My father kicked me out
It's very traumatic
But, much like Tim Dunlear, I'd like to do whatever it takes
to help you, so, here, the shirt off my back
Yeah
And, uh, as you can see,
the Devil does indeed wear Prada
Wow, thanks, brother
Yes, disastrous
with those trousers, though
Oh, what the hell?
As gratitude for telling us
everything you know
And he's naked
Another act
of selfless benevolence
It's quite liberating, actually
Oh, don't forget
Dry-clean only
His story checks out
We need to get a full written statement
And get our guy some lunch, okay?
No-no gluten
or-or dairy, okay?
Another good deed
but still no rush like before
Am I doing this wrong?
In so many ways
Oh?
You're not getting in my car like that
Meet you at mine?
So, who do we suspect of this grisly murder?
Maybe Mr Dunlear wasn't as saintly as he appeared
Who knows who or what he was involved with?
He wasn't always such a good man
It's hard to shake your true nature
Well, not really Look at me
Oh, no, I saw plenty
- Thank you - Cheeky
Oh, Lucifer, Detective
I wasn't expecting you
Yes, we have a few more questions for you
Yes, how are you holding up?
Doing my best
One moment at a time
Mrs Dunlear,
can you think of any personal reason
why someone would want to kill your husband?
I thought this was a robbery
No, turns out
your husband was dead before our homeless thespian
pilfered his valuables
Did Tim have any enemies?
Anyone that would want to hurt him?
No, absolutely not
Everybody loved Tim
Will Fleming
counsel for the foundation and the Dunlears
This won't take long, Mr Fleming
Well, you're absolutely correct,
because my client is done here
- Wha? - Oh
Actually I'm
just here to talk to Vanessa
about the gala is that, uh,
is that all right? Are you up to that?
Yes, of course
Lovely
So I know it's not a good time, Vanessa
But I want to discuss
My client is grieving
You have any questions, you talk to me
All right, can you establish
Vanessa's whereabouts at the time of Tim's death?
Are you accusing my client of murder?
No, but one quarter of murders are committed by family members
Yes, and half by acquaintances
Which gets to my next question
Where were you the night of Tim's death?
Listen, you can look at me all you want
But Tim came into contact with a lot of people around this place
Desperate people
Why do I get the feeling you have someone specific in mind?
Did you ever fight with Tim?
Last night
You didn't tell me that earlier
I was ashamed
Tim told me I might not be receiving
the scholarship money he promised
I got angry
Said some things
I was going to go apologize, but
when I got there
I'm gonna need to test you for gunshot residue
And get a full written statement
Whatever you need
First, I want you to tell me more about
Tim and his relationship
with Vanessa what was it like?
Great
when the cameras were on
And when they were off?
Ah, Detective, you made it
A little underdressed, but okay
What happened with the orphan child?
We're holding him, waiting on ballistics
But he had a lot to say about the Dunlears' perfect marriage
Apparently Tim hadn't slept at home in months
Well, it's probably all those good deeds
So time-consuming
Or I was right
And Tim was back to his old ways
You know, that key card we found in his wallet
was from a hotel, so maybe he was cheating on Vanessa,
she found out,
- then decided to - Punish the cheating bastard
by pumping him full of lead
Well, that's option "A"
Option "B" is the lawyer isn't telling us everything he knows
Option "C" is
an emotionally distraught mistress did him in
Ah, that old chestnut if I can't have him, no one can
What did you get from Vanessa?
- Is that why we're here? - Yes, yes
She asked me to have lunch
with the golden donors of the foundation
on her behalf
It's the least I could do
Oh, the very least
What better way to get intel on a murder than a gaggle
of high-society frenemies?
- Oh - Ah!
Tim Dunlear
was a true humanitarian
Oh, there's so few of us around
And I have no one to help me process my grief
Can you believe my therapist had the nerve
to go on maternity leave?
Oh, well, I'm here for you, Gayle
You can tell me anything
Oh
Oh, ooh
You are a good man
Yeah, not quite the reaction
I was looking for, but, uh, when in Rome
To Tim Dunlear
We all loved him
Mm-hmm, some more than others
So you heard about Donna Gray?
- Oh, yeah - So sad
Throwing yourself at a married man like that
Mm, and when they started sleeping together,
poor Vanessa
Tim turned Donna down cold
Not that it's any
of your business
Oh
Tight-lipped and angry
Yes, well, with all that Botox,
I'm surprised she can chew at all
This is taking too long maybe we should do your hypnotism,
eye-voodoo thing to get them talking
Yes
You would expect that sort of behavior from me, wouldn't you?
Yeah, you making a spectacle to help out a case
Yeah, it's what you do
Don't worry, Detective There'll be a spectacle
These women
are lonely and unappreciated
If I give them what they want, they'll give us what we want
Hello, ladies
Thank you all so much for coming today
Uh, you've all given so generously over the years
to the Dunlear Foundation
In honor of our fallen hero,
I now give you a gift
in return
Me
And he's breaking into song
- Previously on Lucifer - (phone chimes) 
Don't worry, I'll answer for you
CHLOE: He ended it with me tonight 
with a text
Who do you want me to kill?
Lucifer Morningstar
Bye-bye, Devil
This is my Pentecostal coin
Subway token for the damned
It's all yours if you don't shoot me
Leave the bottle
I had sex with your brother 
That puts you in my good graces how?
Well, I was his inside woman,
and now I'm yours
- (gunshots) - LUCIFER: Why is it that sometimes 
I'm immortal
and other times I'm all too human? 
It appears that you make me vulnerable
(men chanting)
(crying)
MAN: Colligitur 
hoc sacrificare 
adulescentulam virginem 
magna atque magnifica 
Lucifer!
(screaming)
Previously on Lucifer 
AMENADIEL: Those wings out there in the human world, 
Luci, they're too powerful A piece of divinity
MAZE: You know exactly what's causing your vulnerability 
Chloe Decker is the one I should be throwing knives at 
LUCIFER: Demon daggers 
forged in Hell don't count We all know those prick
What do you want from me, Malcolm?
You're gonna go into Evidence 
and borrow something for me 
What's that?
This is my Pentecostal coin
I suppose you could use it to get out of Hell
It's all yours if you don't shoot me 
AMENADIEL: You sent your demon to kill me 
(grunting)
If only you'd done what was asked of you, I'd still be home!
(grunts)
Enough! You both used me Here
(clang)
Kill each other
Evil is here Evil is here
DAN: "Morningstar" Whoa
Somebody could be doing this on his behalf, 
or maybe he's involved in a different way 
LUCIFER: You did this You killed those people 
- I did this for you Aren't you happy? - Why would I be happy?
CHLOE: The last place the preacher was seen was near LUX 
- Put your hands up - (scoffs)
Lucifer Morningstar, you're under arrest
Come on, Detective
You can't seriously believe I killed
that pathetic malcontent
It doesn't matter what I believe
That's all that matters, Detective
Put your hands in the air and surrender yourself
(laughing)
This isn't funny, Lucifer
Isn't it?
(laughs) I think
this is the grandest joke that I've heard in all my time
(laughs) The best part is it's on me!
(laughing)
Come peacefully
We'll go to the station
No
We won't
(sighs) What are you doing?
I'm accepting my role in all of this
All of humanity's sins are the Devil's fault, right?
I mean, I thought you knew different, but I was wrong
You're just like all the others
So,
why not add one more murder to the pile?
That's not what this is, Lucifer
Come on What are you waiting for?
You wanted your bad guy Well, here he is,
gift-wrapped just for you!
Don't take another step
You!
Newbie
Come on Riddle me with bullets,
so you can go home, drink an ice-cold beer,
and feel better about yourselves!
Don't shoot him He's unarmed
Oh, you don't know that Maybe I have a gun
Hands in the air!
Do it!
Don't!
(panting)
(wind blowing)
OFFICER: What just happened?
(sighs)
Search the area
He can't have gotten far
(thunder rumbling)
(panting)
Can we not tell anyone
you just carried me in your arms like a baby?
What were you trying to accomplish in there?
Uh, a good death?
Or at least a nice and messy one
But then you had to come and ruin everything, like always
(groans)
Why'd you swoop in and stop it?
Wouldn't let someone else send me to Hell, is that it?
Well, guess what, brother, you don't need to kill me,
because I'm done here
I've had my fun on Earth, and
(sighs)
there's no reason for me to stay anymore
You win
I'll go willingly
Please, just
take me back to Hell
No
(sighs)
(camera shutter clicking)
Hey What happened to Lucifer?
You didn't hear?
What happened to him?
He disappeared He's on the run
OFFICER: Ow
Let me see that
Have you ever seen a knife like this?
Yeah Uh, I'll take it to the station
Careful It's crazy sharp
Great
Hey
I need to talk to you
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
especially after what just happened,
but I think Lucifer is innocent
Chloe, Lucifer got into a fight with the deceased
just a couple hours ago We both saw it
I know Just hear me out
Okay? Just pretend you don't know Lucifer
- I already like it - Our suspect
is a club owner who likes to tell people he's the Devil
You're not really selling his innocence
He's a man who embraces desire, lives by his passion
Now think about the body The guy was executed,
single bullet to the head
There's no passion behind this
- This isn't him - Then it's a frame job
Who would want to set him up?
- I don't know - OFFICER 2: Detective,
we may have found the murder weapon
Okay Test it for prints and DNA
- Yes, ma'am - Thanks
Lucifer's prints are gonna be on that gun
- You don't know that - I do
And I also know you're right
Lucifer's innocent
What?
Chloe, we have to talk
Somewhere else
You don't want to take me back to Hell?
The one bloody thing you've wanted this entire time
(chuckles) Did I punch you
in the head too hard?
Maze was right, Luci
We used her
And Malcolm People have died
because of us
Because of you, you mean
Yes Because of me
Right
Brother, somehow I lost sight of the bigger picture,
of the cost of my actions,
and just how truly selfish they were
But, Luci, my eyes are wide open now,
and I need to make this right
Do you know, I think this side of you's actually scarier
than the angry one
I need to find Malcolm,
and I need to send him back to Hell
Will you help me, brother?
(sighs)
One last bit of punishment on the way out
(thunder rumbles)
It sounds like fun to me
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - wwwAddic7edcom -
Ah, there's nothing like a fresh shirt after a rainy rooftop
What is that smell?
(groans) Tropical musk candles
Gosh, the sacrifices you made pretending to be a therapist
Yeah, I like that scent
- Of course you do - Okay,
can we please just focus?
Now, what's your plan to find Malcolm?
My plan?
- Yeah - Well, I thought you were
the expert at plotting murder
Or not so expert, considering I'm still alive
Which is why I brought us here,
so that we could come up with a plan
Right Well, it sounds more like you want me
to do all the heavy lifting So how's this? Step one,
travel back in time and not make such a mess of things
You know, I'm suddenly reminded of why I wanted you dead
in the first place
Luci, what is your problem?
Oh, good question, Doctor Well, you see,
the thing is that my brother has been trying to kill me
and now he wants to work with me
but we can't seem to get along,
mainly because he's an egotistical twit
Hello?
Oh, I'm sorry,
Dr Canaan I didn't realize that you were in session
with a Lucifer?
(scoffing) Oh
I can't believe this
You're stealing my patient
Uh, not exactly
Actually, you may be just what we need, my dear doctor
I deserve that
You lied to me
I don't even know you
You shot a man in cold blood
I shot Malcolm to protect you
Everything I saw at Palmetto, it was all true!
You let them think I was crazy
- I never intended - You let me think I was crazy
I'm sorry
You don't get to be sorry
If I could take it all back, I would
You can't take it back!
I know
But you can make this right
How?
Prove Lucifer is innocent
Where are you going?
Lucifer thinks I abandoned him
I need to find him
LINDA: So you're-you're brothers?
Unfortunately
LUCIFER: And we're having a terrible time working together
But because you've been so helpful with me, Linda,
hopefully you can help fix our problems
Listen, I know this must be a shock
Are you even a real doctor?
(laughing) No, of course he isn't
Gosh, if he had any clue about human nature,
we wouldn't be in this mess
Oh You dare criticize me?
Luci, you're arrogant,
you're selfish, all you do is
- think with your penis - Oh
LUCIFER: Oh Which, of course, you would never do, would you?
How's Maze, by the way?
Dr Martin, will you please tell him to shut up
and just listen to reason?
Oh, if by reason, you mean a deceptive load
- of bull - Enough!
You lied to me about being a doctor
so you could manipulate Lucifer,
who is actually
your brother
Somehow
Do you realize
the ethical position you've put me in?
(chuckles)
And you, let me guess,
you were gonna make a sexual joke
about putting me in a position
That's true, yeah
Because everything's a joke to you
And yet, for some reason, I take you seriously,
even when you insist on clinging to these ridiculous metaphors
Heaven, Hell, angels, devils
- Actually, they're not - Trust me,
you don't want to pick that fight
You claimed you came to LA
to reinvent yourself, yet every time
I think you come upon a moment of realization,
you go the exact wrong direction with it
I did Ho-Hold on You're right I did come to LA
to start a new life, didn't I?
And now Malcolm's on the run
He's gonna need to start a new life, too
- No, see, you're doing it again - LUCIFER: New ID,
bank account, passport
I know just the person to go to
Oh
Damn, you're good
- Yep - (door shuts)
(Chloe clears throat)
Where's Lucifer?
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you
You've never liked me
Why?
Because every day was a party
Every sin, every desire LA offered,
we took part
And then he met you
So you think it's my fault that the party's over?
That and the fact that you're hunting him down like a dog
I don't think he killed the preacher
I need you to help me find him before another cop does
So where would he go?
- You know him better than anyone - These days
it seems you know him better than I do
So where do you think he's going?
To get punishment
Which means he's going after Malcolm
Then maybe he hasn't changed that much after all
If he gets to Malcolm first,
he really will go down for murder
You can't come with me
You said you needed my help finding him, right?
I don't see anybody else backing you up
Byron was a nice guy, a handy guy
He fixed my toaster once
Not a BLT goes by I don't think of Byron
LUCIFER: Excuse me!
Yeah, sorry to interrupt the riveting eulogy,
but I'm here to see the funeral director
Hello, Neil Remember me?
In a bit of a rush,
unfortunately
Whereas this poor chap, well, he's not going anywhere, is he?
Sir, please wait until after we're finished
This is disrespectful
Uh, no, this is disrespectful
I mean, this whole show who's it for, really?
Eh? Not him
He's not hearing any of this
Would you back me up, please, bro?
He is right
See? Trust me, he should know
No, it's for you, isn't it?
It's a selfish way
for you to all feel better about yourselves about how much
you ignored this poor sod in life
Oh, did you choose this suit?
Mr Morningstar, this way
Oh, you do remember me?
Feel free to carry on
You have no right disrupting this funeral
- This is my business - Yes
Your least profitable one
Your main source of income is creating new identities,
which is why I came to you five years ago to get
my proper papers and all that
And I did great work for you, Mr Morningstar
- So why are you doing this? - Well, if I know you're the best,
then Malcolm Graham does, as well
(sighs) The cop
- Yeah - Yeah, he needed it to be done fast,
but said he'd need time to get his hands on the 100K
Where would a homicide detective get that kind of money quickly?
Mm, look at you, Sherlock
(sighs) He mentioned an old associate
Tommy, I think
Great We'll do a search
for every "Tommy" in Los Angeles
What's another thousand years?
No, no, no, no An old associate of Malcolm's, you say?
I think I might know just the person who can help us
Rhymes with "douche"
Thanks, Neil
I wish I had my knives
You're not gonna need 'em
I never need them
LAPD! Malcolm, if
Oh
Hello?
Anyone here?
(scoffs)
Looks like Malcolm likes to shop
You cops must make a lot of money
You hiring?
We're not, and we don't
I have no idea how he can afford all this stuff
Well, if you don't make good money, why do you do this job?
'Cause I get to shoot people,
which is something you should keep in mind
(laughs) No really Why?
'Cause I hate it when people get away with things they shouldn't
And you like to shoot people
Yeah
Huh
And to think I almost killed you in your sleep that one time
Wait What?
(door creaks open)
(gun clicking)
(gunshot)
(panting)
Oh, now I know why he likes working with you
Malcolm, it's the police!
Stop firing and put the gun down!
WOMAN: He's not with you?
Please tell me he's not with you
Sorry I thought you were my husband
Mel, why were you shooting at Malcolm?
Ever since he almost died, he
he's been different, he's been strange
I can't describe it
He has a newfound appetite
An insatiable hunger
he just can't seem to fill
How do you know?
I've seen it before
Where?
Right I forgot who I was talking to
It only gets worse
It can't get worse!
He spent all our money
And when I saw him today, he
Wait When did he come by today?
You just missed him
He was frantic He was looking for money, and he was angry
He was so angry
And he had this look in his eye, and he said things like
Do you have any idea where he might have gone?
(scoffs)
He said he was gonna go get a beer
- (phone buzzing) - Okay
Thanks Excuse me
Malcolm's good, Chloe
I can't find any evidence tying him to the murders
How's it going on your end?
Malcolm's not home Mel said he went out for a beer
Does that make any sense to you?
No When I saw him, he was scared
I think he knows Lucifer's gonna come after him
He looked like a guy getting ready to run
Yeah, well, he doesn't have the money to get far
Yeah, but he's the kind of guy who'd know how to find it
Oh, maybe there's a bar that owes him money
Yeah, or one that he could rob for some extra cash
I'll look into it
(door squeaks open and shut)
Don't move, or wobbly head gets it
How did you get in here?
There's a manhunt for you
And this is the last place you'd look, isn't it?
I thought it was quite clever
Ooh
You need to get the hell out of here
Oh, we're gonna need some information first
- Who are you? - LUCIFER: Not this again
He's my brother I know, shocking, isn't it?
He's much less handsome than I am
AMENADIEL: We're looking for Malcolm, Detective
Now, we've been told that he's seeing an associate named Tommy?
There are a lot of Tommys in
A beer Of course
We'd very much like to know what you just realized
Too bad I'm not telling you
(laughs) But you want to, though, don't you?
No, I don't
Oh, you're a complicated one That is a surprise
So, come on, what do you want to do, Daniel? Hmm?
I
I want to redeem myself
Oh And taking down Malcolm would do that, wouldn't it?
So where is he?
Come on, you can tell us
Like you said, we're surrounded by police
There's an old brewery on Third
Mm-hmm
A drug dealer named Tommy Campolongo works out of there
Ah Not that complicated after all
So you two will stay in a holding cell while I
(whooshing)
Okay Tommy Campolongo
That makes sense, that he'd have cash on him
But he's not gonna hand it over nicely
I'm leaving the precinct now
Okay, meet me there with backup I'm not far
Chloe, don't go
Damn it
MAN: You like that?
(laughing)
And to think, after all this time,
I just thought you were dead
What can I say?
It's hard to keep a good man down
- Mm-hmm - And now
I'm ready to get the old band back together
You have some product you can move?
We've got some seizures
just sitting there in evidence
Could actually get you a supply today if you've got cash
I always have cash, Malcolm
You know that
That I do, Tommy
That I do
How much you thinking?
How much you got?
(laughing)
(imitating laughter)
(clattering)
What's going on up there?
This ain't me
What you waiting for?!
But hey
Gift horse and all that am I right?
Why don't you go ahead, open up that safe, my man?
Oh
hello there
If you miscreants don't mind,
we're looking for Malcolm Graham
Hand him over, and we all can be on our way
without too much fuss
You two made a huge mistake walking in here
(guns clicking)
(stammers)
What do you say we skip the time-slowing shenanigans, hmm?
What about your mortality situation?
Well, it's kind of a non-sitch when the detective's not around
I'll explain later, but for now,
we'll just, you know, enjoy the moment
(chuckles) After you
Lovely
Right, I should warn you
(grunts)
(sighs) This is hardly a fair fight
d Hey, hey d
(gunshots)
d Hey, hey now d
d Hey, hey now d
(shouts)
d Hey, hey, there's a fire and it's running, coming in here d
(grunting)
d Hey, hey now, hey, hey now d
d Hey, hey d
d Hey, hey now d
Sorry, bro Genuine mistake
d Yeah, hey, hey now, burning out of luck d
d Gonna wear the crown d
d Hey, hey now, things are burning up d
(gun clicks)
Oh, do you need some help with that?
d Things are burning up d
(screams)
d Oh, oh, oh d
(both laugh)
And to think, we wasted all that millennia
fighting each other, right?
We still need to find Malcolm
Absolutely
You know, if we split up, we'll cover more ground
Okay, but no hogging all the fun
if you find him first deal?
Deal
(man groaning)
Oh!
(grunts)
d d
(groaning)
Wow I mean,
wow I could tell it was something special,
but I had no idea that was gonna work
(moaning)
But you never know until you try
(groaning)
Got to say,
you don't look so scary now, Amenadude
Oi!
What part of "no hogging" don't you understand?
(groans, panting)
(sighs) Bloody hell!
There you go, spoiling
my fun again
Leave me, and go get him
You know how much I hate being in anyone's debt
I figure if I save you now, that makes us even, right?
Besides, it's
it's just a flesh wound
Hardly can see what you're whining about
(panting)
What happened?
He was struck with a blade not of this world, Maze
One of mine
Yes
I'll handle this
How?
Find him
With pleasure
(clattering)
Malcolm, freeze!
Stop!
(gunshots)
(panting)
(gun clicks)
Don't move
Easy, Detective
You're a hard man to find
Look, I know you think I'm a bad guy,
but I'm simply trying to catch our dear friend Malcolm
so I can tear his arms and legs off
- This has nothing to do with you - You know I can't let you do that
(sighs) You don't know what he's done
You'd never believe me anyway
But all you need to know is that he's here to get money
and then he's gonna disappear For good
You mean this money?
I'm not here to arrest you, Lucifer
I know you're innocent
I always have
So let's catch this bastard together
and put an end to all this
Ah Look at us, reunited, and it feels so good
Malcolm won't get far without his getaway cash
Where's Maze?
She's taking care of something important
Oh, of course your ninja bartender is off on a secret mission
Why, Detective, are you pining
- for some good cop/demon copop action? - No
I just want to clear your name and find Malcolm
No, no, no, no, no
Who cares about the Devil's rap sheet?
Why don't we just skip that part
and go straight to the main course?
Because it's incredibly impulsive and shortsighted
Have you noticed that's my jam?
If we fix your reputation,
we'll preserve everything we've done
You want to keep working with me
- And to do that, you need to trust me - (door opens)
- (sighs) - (indistinct police transmission)
- Okay Well - Right Very well, Detective
I'm in your hands But how you intend
to prove my innocence is beyond me
Put your hands down
We found the evidence we need
LUCIFER: He did?
Can I rethink my surrender?
What'd you find?
It's better if I show you
(indistinct chatter)
d d
(moans)
(groans) Enough,
Mazikeen
I've made my peace with death,
whether I go to Heaven or Hell
I know exactly where you're going
Nowhere You're staying right here
Now shut up and let me help you
(gasps) There's nothing
that you can do
It would take something divine to heal me
d I'm Hollywood d
You took that from Lucifer?
I kept it a secret
I thought I could use it to get us back home
And you'd give that to me?
Believe me,
I don't understand this either
d We'll always be together d
d Forever, forever d
d Forever d
d Forever d
d Forever, forever d
d Forever d
(sighs) Why do I feel like I'm walking death row?
Should I order my final meal now to save time?
Dan says he has it handled
You do, right?
I do
I'm here to turn myself in
What are you doing?
I removed a firearm from Evidence lockup,
and I gave it to Detective Malcolm Graham
I believe Detective Graham
then used that weapon to shoot and kill Jacob Williams,
the crime that
Mr Morningstar is suspected of
Well,
Detective Espinoza,
I
didn't know you had the stones
No more Detective Douche?
Well, not today, at least
Let's go
Dan
(phone buzzing)
(sighs)
I need to take this
Hey, honey Everything okay?
MALCOLM: Hello, Decker
Malcolm?
How's the precinct?
I still have a few buddies at the stations
Oh, and I made a new friend today, too
Pulled her out of a boring class for some bonding time
Here, say hi
Hi, Mommy
Hey, Trixie
Are you okay, honey?
Mommy's here
Uh, that's enough of that
(sighs) What do you want, Malcolm?
Aw Poor Chloe Decker
Did someone take something from you,
something valuable?
Hurts, don't it?
You want your money
Bull's-eye
Now, don't even think about talking to the cops Remember,
- you don't know who's with me - Okay
And keep Lucifer out of this
Just you
or she dies
d d
d You're an unusual suspect now and may be right d
d The kind all men cannot recollect or forget at night d
d You're the rough detective with the smokey eye d
d Where the person you are after is the other guy d
Hey Um, I need the duffel bag we seized today
Where is it? (clears throat)
We were just about to take it to Evidence
Okay I need to examine it
Sure
LUCIFER: Ah,
there you are
Is everything all right, Detective?
Yeah
Of course
I'll be right back
Right
d Well, I'm a rough detective on a glory ride d
d You keep going faster so I slow down d
d You hear me laughing d
- d In the background d - (siren whooping)
(with American accent) Detective Decker,
step away from your vehicle
Put your hands in the air
and walk towards me peacefully
If you do not
I repeat if you do not,
we will have no choice but to shoot you
with our new bazooka
We've actually been waiting months and months to use it, so,
on second thought, please, speed away
What are you doing?
Well, I could ask you the s
(feedback squeals)
(normally) I could ask you the same thing
You going somewhere without me, hmm?
Right after all this talk about trusting you,
you're immediately keeping secrets?
I don't have time to explain to you Something came up
Something that obviously requires quite a bit of cash
I didn't know you had it in you, Detective
- It isn't for me - Oh, you're gonna make
it rain at the local strip clubs then?
- Lucifer - Or perhaps that phone call earlier
wasn't as innocuous as you made it out to be
Fine You leave me no choice
Malcolm has Trixie
Oh
If I get him his money, he'll let her go
Right Because if Malcolm's established anything,
it's his trustworthiness
What choice do I have?
To ride shotgun with the Devil, for starters
If Malcolm sees you,
he'll kill her I'm sorry,
but I can't risk it her life's at stake
Right So you're just gonna get
both of you killed then, are you?
He needs this money to leave town
I won't give it to him until she's safe
And what about your safety?
Trixie is all that matters
- Detective, I - I don't have
time to argue with you, Lucifer
I realize how bad this can go, but I don't have a choice
This is my daughter
Promise me you'll let me go alone
Fine
You have my word
(sighs)
Don't look so sad
Your mommy's coming to pick you up
Good I don't like you
What's not to like?
(grunts)
- Trixie - All right, easy, Decker
Easy
Mommy, can we go home now?
Yes, Monkey (sniffles) We can
Glad to see you came alone
Now toss the gun
(panting)
Now the other one
There You happy?
Yeah, once I get my money, sure
So, where is it?
Not without Trixie
- Oh, come on, Decker - Malcolm, that's the deal
Go on
Hi
Okay, listen to me
We're gonna play a game, all right?
I need you to hide until I can come find you
Mommy, I don't want to play a game
- I know you don't, baby - (imitates gunshot)
But I need you to go hide really, really well, okay?
Go
(chuckles) Kids, huh?
(sighs, coughs)
It's there It's-it's all there
It's in the bag
Yeah I believe you
You don't need to do this, Malcolm
I know, but I was gonna shoot you at Palmetto,
and now I feel like I've been given a second chance here,
so I'm sure as hell not gonna waste it
LUCIFER: Is this really what you did
with your second chance?
Deary me, Malcolm Pathetic
Hey, Lucifer
Hey, buddy Long time no frame
Though that didn't stick too well, did it?
Guess I need to find a more permanent solution
Give me the gun, Malcolm
Why? Not afraid of you
All you're doing is getting yourself killed
And for what?
To buy your precious detective some more time?
No
No, I want to ask you a question
Oh (chuckles softly)
What do you desire, Malcolm?
(whispering): Lucifer, what are you doing?
What do you yearn for in that
rotten soul of yours?
I
You've been given a second chance, Malcolm
Is killing Detective Decker
really what you want to do with it?
I don't
No, of course you don't
You want to live, don't you?
I do
More than almost anything
Almost?
(gunshot)
(gasping)
There's one more thing
You feel that?
That's what it's like to die, my man
I know, 'cause I've done it
And what I want, more than anything
is for you to feel that pain
To go through what I did
Because we both know where you're going to
Bet you never expected
to miss this thing so soon
Yeah
Don't worry
You won't be going alone
I'll be sending Decker along right behind you
Oh, Chloe
Oh, Decker
(coughing)
Here, Chloe, Chloe, Chloe
LUCIFER: I don't know if this is all 
part of the plan
Or if You can even hear me
But if You're up there
Dad
(laughs)
I need a favor
(Lucifer gasping)
I'll be the son 
You always wanted me to be 
(Lucifer choking)
I'll do as You ask (heartbeat echoing slowly)
Go where You want me to
I
In exchange,
all I ask is
is that you protect Chloe
(heartbeat stops)
(ethereal choral music plays)
(echoing) Home, sweet home
d d
That can't be right
(clinking)
It's open
(low rumbling)
This isn't possible
(gasps)
(panting)
(chuckles)
Hello, Malkie
It doesn't matter
(snorting, choking)
I've got your coin
Oh
I'll be back
You're looking for this?
How?
I know a guy
Apparently, He wants me back here
(sighs)
Sorry, pal
One use only
CHLOE: Trixie!
Come out, honey!
Mommy, is it over?
Yeah, baby, it's over Come here
Hi
Oh, I'm so happy you're okay
Excuse me if I don't join the group hug
(whispering) I thought he killed you
Oh, he did
Yes
I got better
Hmm
You promised you'd let me go alone
True
But I didn't say anything about following
What's wrong?
(sighs)
Isn't it past her bedtime?
Hmm?
(footsteps approaching)
(Lucifer sighs)
(broken glass clinking)
LUCIFER: Ah!
Sleeping on the job?
Luci, we still have to find Malcolm
Malcolm, yes
That's dealt with It's old news, really
(grunts)
(sighs)
Where's Maze?
Well, I was gonna ask you the same question
Perhaps your snoring drove her away
(chuckles)
(sighs)
I spoke to Dad
Excuse me?
Yeah I offered Him my services in exchange f
Well, that doesn't really matter
He accepted
He replied to you
Mmm
Well, not in words
But His message was clear
And what does Father want?
Someone's escaped from Hell
Must've seen a window of opportunity
whilst you were incapacitated
I think He wants me to bring
our jailbird back
That's it?
Well, it shouldn't be too hard
to track down a single errant soul
(chuckles)
(fingernails clinking glass)
You're afraid
Mmm
Damn right I am
Right, but you're never afraid
Who could possibly scare you, brother?
Lucifer
Who escaped Hell?
Mum

- Previously on Lucifer - So, you're the Devil
and you've left Hell behind
to take a vacation in Los Angeles
Well, where else would I go?
Your return to the Underworld
has been requested
Remind Dad that I quit Hell because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play
I got it
The name, the whole Lucifer thing,
and desire's like your superpower
More like a gift from God, really
Why don't I affect you, Detective?
I guess we both have our mysteries
Chloe Decker is causing your vulnerability
I'm bleeding
I've been sleeping with a demon
I'm ready to turn myself in
I removed a firearm from evidence lockup
Dad
I'll be the son
that you always wanted me to be
This is impossible
Where's Maze?
I was gonna ask you the same question
What does Father want?
Someone's escaped from Hell
Who escaped Hell?
Mum
Everybody, get the hell on the ground!
Fill the bag with everything
on display
Hurry up!
This is such a cliché
I mean, for one,
those are all conflict diamonds
Terrible karma,
but more importantly,
is this really how you want to spend your time on Earth?
I don't know who you are,
but if you don't step back, I will kill you
But that's not what
you really desire, is it?
No, it isn't
So, what do you want?
Freedom
Oh
just as I suspected
You were tired of being a prisoner, weren't you?
Yeah, that's right
I-I-I couldn't take it anymore
So you wanted to break your shackles, be reborn
I did
So you escaped Hell,
looking for an empty body,
and found this poor sod,
who'd just died of a heart attack,
and now here you are, wreaking havoc on Earth
The jig is up
We found you, Mum
Wait, what?
You just said you wanted to escape your shackles
Yeah
When the paramedics brought me back,
I realized I needed to be free
Yes, from Hell
No, man, from debt
I owe a ton of money
And this was gonna get me out from underneath it
You know what, I'm sick of this
The two of you are
It's not Mom
Oh, you think?
Well, we had to check
She doesn't have a body
She must have entered a human form
of someone who's recently died
Which means anyone who kicked the bucket
whilst you were sleeping on the job
Luci, do you realize he's the last one on our list?
Well, you must have missed one
Or maybe she's not in Los Angeles
No, she's here
I kept her prisoner for thousands of years
She's coming for me
I know it
We just need to get to her first
Are you coming?!
In a moment
There's so much punishment, so little time
dead
What's going on?
My mum's gonna kill me
And before you say it, that's not a metaphor
She's literally going to kill me
She's not the forgiving type
You've never mentioned your mother before
Why is that?
Well, you wouldn't understand, would you?
I'd like to
Oh, all right
Very well
In human terms,
once upon a time, a boy met a girl,
and they fell in love
They had sex
The only trouble was,
they were celestial beings,
so that moment created the universe
Mm, the Big Bang?
Never knew how appropriate the name was until now, did you?
Anyway, they became Mum and Dad
They had a whole litter of kids, including yours truly
And they built a house
They called it Heaven
They were happy
Dad was
well, Dad, and Mum
Well, Mum was rather lovely in the beginning
But things change, don't they?
Dad started going into the garage
and tinkering with a little project he called humanity
Mum grew cold distant
And pretty soon, they were both neglecting their family
And then one of his children started to act out?
Indeed
Yeah so Dad got pissed off
and tossed me out of the house
And what did your mother do?
Nothing
She just stood there and let it happen
Anyway, a couple of thousand years later,
Dad kicked her out, too
Cast her into Hell and put her in a cell
So, I did the same for her as she did for me
Zilch
Is it good to be back
on a studio set, Detective?
Not really
It's bringing back memories of your acting days?
If you're feeling nostalgic,
sure I can find some horny teenagers and a hot tub
'Cause the movie you were in was
Yeah, I got it
Is everything all right, Detective?
You seem distracted
Usually I get at least a glimmer of a smile
from my remarks,
the occasional eye roll
I think I got a snort once
Two days ago, you were shot point-blank
Ah, well, no need to thank me for my heroism
Well, maybe just a little
No one's stopping you
There was blood all over you
- You should be dead - Well,
par for the course for our adventures,
Detective What's new?
I have a sample of your blood
and I'm gonna take it and test it
- Oh - And I'm gonna find out
exactly what you are once and for all
- Yeah - Oh
The Devil himself?
No, I'm guessing Larry Morningstar,
the son of a plumber in Connecticut
Right, well, wrap that up, would you?
'Cause I could use your help on my end
I'm on a bit of a manhunt
Well, womanhunt, and I need to find her before
I'm too late
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
So, our victim's name is Gillian Taylor
She was a stand-in for the lead actress on Leave It to Leslie
Stand-in?
Yeah, stand-ins are used to light a scene
as the actors prep
Usually want to be actors themselves
And now she's dead because of me
What do you mean, because of you?
Well, remind you of anyone?
That's weird
What's weird, Ella?
Well
you'd think cause of death would be
the giant chunks of metal
sticking out of her head, but no,
she was strangled Look
You can see the contusions on her neck
So, the horns were added postmortem?
Yeah, soft tissue at the point of impact is yellow-pink
That means that there was no blood pressure
when our killer went all stabby-stab
And
she was killed somewhere else
This body was moved here
So, the killer is sending a message
Ah, good, so you agree with me
I didn't say the message was to you
Well, who else would it be for?
What the hell?
Oh, joy of joys, I thought Detective Douche
was in jail
He's suspended
Or at least he was
Give us a minute
Hi
Hey
What are you doing here?
I've been reinstated
What?
After Malcolm and everything that happened at Palmetto,
they wanted to sweep everything under the rug
And the only thing I confessed to was
improperly checking out evidence
A gun that killed someone
I didn't ask for this
You didn't turn it down, either
Would you rather I go to jail?
You think Trixie would prefer that?
No, it's just it's a lot to take in
I've been demoted
I've been reassigned
to assist on cases, so
for now, how can I help?
Uh, interview crew members
See if they know anything, any enemies she had
I mean, you know
Thanks, Chloe
Yeah
You're a newbie, aren't you?
Oh, hey, yeah
Ella Lopez
I just transferred in a couple days ago
You must be Detective Decker's civilian consultant
Lucifer Morningstar
Cool
I was expecting
a different reaction considering
your choice of bling
Oh
Dude, I had a friend named Adolf
Okay, Adolf
I didn't hold it against him
And besides, I think the Devil
- gets a bad rap - Oh
- You do, do you? - Sure
I mean, what did he really do that was so bad?
What, rebel against his dad?
Ask some naked lady if she wanted an apple?
Be still my heart Do go on
I suppose he does run Hell
That's not so great, you know, with the torture
and eternal damnation
I'm retired
And besides, I didn't create Hell
I just worked there
And now you're talking
in the first person
Wait
- Are you - The Devil?
- a method actor? - What?
Not exactly an Emmy-worthy performance
from our child actor
And her dick nozzle boyfriend
Weird, for a girl
who normally doesn't wear mascara,
she's certainly wearing a lot
I wonder why
Trixie loves her show
Oh, my God, me, too
Sweet candy coating on the outside,
delicious evil on the inside?
Or she just likes the attention
Either way, she's got a wall of reps surrounding her
I've got a call in to interview her
But for now let's focus on Gillian
Yeah
Gillian rented from me for four years
Such a sweet, strong girl
You know, I I don't have a daughter, but, uh
You know, she got so close on so many auditions
I I really thought that she was gonna break in
This is my fault
Why do you say that?
Well, I work as a set nurse
I pulled a few strings
I got her that job
If she hadn't met Amy
Do you think Amy did this?
No, sweet, darling, innocent Amy?
Oh, I'm sensing sarcasm and general loathing
Oh, that girl's a bad influence
She has so much cocaine up her nose, it would snow
- if you shook her - Yes, I've tried that
The show kept it out of the news
They even hid her OD
a couple of days ago
Hospital was barely able to start her heart again
Well, hold on
You're saying Amy died, then came back to life,
and then an innocent girl was found dead
with devil horns shoved into her skull?
I guess that's
one way to put it
Yes
Maybe Gillian wasn't as innocent as she seemed
Well, maybe she needed the cash to fund her flamingo army
We need to check on Gillian's financials
See if she made any large cash deposits and, if so, when
I don't know Maybe we can find a pattern
Well, it doesn't matter, because I know who the killer is
Really? Who?
My mum
Your mom?
It's a long story, but I think
my mum's soul is currently inside Amy
She's the perfect choice of host body, really
Young, beautiful, worshipped and adored by millions
You're making less sense than you normally do
That's because you still don't believe me!
Just test my blood, Detective
Then we can have a real conversation
Oh
Look at you, all broody
Suits you
Well, don't worry
Maze always turns up eventually
She's like a bad penny in tight leather pants
Unless, of course, you scared her away for good
I scared her away?
Well, everything was fine until you went all lovey-dovey on her
Really? Because I seem to remember
her telling both of us where to shove it
Luci, you don't think she helped Mom escape, do you?
Well, that doesn't sound like the kind of evil,
duplicitous thing a demon would do, now, does it?
But, no,
I don't because I found Mum
- You did? Where? - On a case
And on top of that, I think the detective's
gonna finally believe me about who I am soon, so cheers!
Everything's coming up Lucifer
- What did you do? - I didn't do anything
She's going to test my blood
- She's what?! - Mm Exciting, isn't it?
Humans can't have proof of divinity!
Just the detective I don't see the harm
Sure I mean, what could possibly go wrong
if angel blood enters the police department's forensic database?
I'm sorry Am I supposed to answer that?
You just deal with Mom
I'll deal with this mess
At least I got you to stop brooding
And you're welcome
- Hey, Chloe - Hey
I interviewed the crew
For the most part, Amy and Gillian got along great
For the most part?
Yeah, they got into a big fight
a couple days ago as they were setting up a shot
Unfortunately, they weren't rolling audio
Well, I get the gist of it
Gillian had a bunch of money hidden away at her place
And then this blowup
What do you think?
Amy had a secret drug problem?
Then Gillian found out about it and was blackmailing her?
If so, that's a pretty strong motive
It is, yeah Thanks, Dan
Well, now I know where I got my taste for the good life
- What are you doing in here? - Amy Dodd, eh?
Role model for teen girls,
awkward erection for their fathers
A wolf in a sheep's tiny skirt
It's very appropriate, Mum
Who are you, and what are you doing in here?
Yeah
Let's stop playing games, shall we?
I know you're not who you pretend to be
I know who you really are
All right
Attacking me would be a waste of What are you doing?
You can't do this!
I'm tired of everyone thinking I'm so innocent
But I'm not, and I'll prove it
Please don't! Oh, God, don't!
Good Lord, that's Ugh
Mmm Wait
You're not who I thought you were, are you? I hope
Oh, I'm exactly who you think I am
Well, then this truly is the most evil thing
that's ever happened to me
Just-just stop doing the buttons and just
just please
Ms Dodd?
- Ah - What the hell is going on?
Right For once, this is not what it looks like
- I'm in so much trouble - We don't care
- about your drug use, Amy - You don't?
What we care about is that you Gillian
had an argument right before she died Why?
- Does it matter? - We found
a lot of cash at Gillian's house,
so if she was blackmailing you
She wasn't blackmailing me
She was my sober companion
Well, clearly not very good at it
The production company thought it was a good idea
to hire my stand-in to also keep an eye on me
They thought it would help keep it a secret
- What was the fight about? - I was getting
tired of her treating me like a child
I'm an adult!
I can make my own decisions
Clearly
I'd gotten a new supply in
She was trying to take it away from me
Oh
Just take-take it all away
A devil emoji? That's it
I'm speaking to a copyright lawyer today
So Gillian cut off your supply
That must have pissed off your dealer Who is he?
I-I never met him
All I have is a number
I'd text him, he'd messenger me the drugs
Okay, good I'm gonna need that number
Okay Thank you
Okay, so the production company
confirms that they paid Gillian under the table
to be Amy's sober companion
That explains the cash
I mean, I'm not saying Amy's innocent,
but I don't see a motive anymore
Well, what about our emoji-loving drug dealer?
Could be a show of strength
Making sure no one screws with him in the future
I put a warrant in to locate his cell phone, and, uh
What?
Do you still think this is about you?
Of course I do, but it's worse than I thought
My mum is clearly playing the long game
Taunting me with my own distorted image again and again
No, really Do you really think the drug dealer is your mother?
Well, she's clever enough to pull it all off
What? You thought I took after my dad?
Oh You don't have to believe anything I say, Detective
Test my blood
Oh, dearie me, why are you hesitating?
Scared to find out the truth?
I'm not scared about anything
other than finding out what STDs you have
Very funny
Hey
Hey!
- How did? - What the hell
are you doing in here?
I'm sorry I, uh
I must have gotten lost
Good night
You don't think you deserve any of the blame
for what happened with your mother?
No That's between her and Dad
Then whose fault is it?
Well, I suppose none of this would have happened
if Amenadiel had been watching over Hell
like he was supposed to
I thought that was your job
Well, it was, but when I abdicated, it became his
Sort of like a game of hot potato
And then there's Maze
And what about her?
Well, she's still missing
See, I'm-I'm worried she might
be involved in all this
Might explain why Mum was able
to hit the ground running with my torment
And
I wouldn't be in this mess
if it wasn't for the detective,
and she doesn't even know it!
And why is that?
Well, when I asked Father for the favor, I
Look, it doesn't matter
Even if I told her, she wouldn't believe me anyway
Sounds like there's a lot of blame to go around
Yes
Is there anyone you might be leaving out?
Anyone I'm leaving out
Um
Oh, you're right
Yes
If you'd fixed my existential problem earlier,
none of this would have happened
Well, good on you for taking responsibility, Doctor
It's very noble
Ah
I worry you're not gaining anything from our sessions
- What do you mean? - Lately,
you're using our sessions as an excuse
to misinterpret what I say for your own gain
What?
I don't think I'm actually helping you
Are you breaking up with me?
I'm asking the question
Are our sessions actually helping,
or just making things worse?
Lucifer?
You said you wanted to talk
Hello, Chloe
What's going on?
I was really hoping I wouldn't have to do this, but
recent developments have left me with no other choice
No other choice than to what?
You need to know the truth, Chloe
About Lucifer
All right
I'm listening
Oh, I'm not gonna tell you I'm gonna show you
What are you doing?
Amenadiel Amenadiel, no!
Okay, you're gonna be fine
I'm gonna call an ambulance You're gon
You c
You're you're okay
How?
Okay, this is going to be hard for you to hear,
which is why I needed you to see what Lucifer is
No
I don't believe it
Good
Because it's all a lie
Bulletproof vest and blood packs
Are you insane?
You could have killed yourself!
I was perfectly safe, Chloe
This, by the way, is what Lucifer wore
when you guys confronted Malcolm
- How would you know that? - Because I put it on him
He knew what he was walking into
Listen, everything that he does is part of a performance
All right
Then what about the weird mojo thing he does?
Neural linguistic programming?
The power of suggestion?
Look, he studied it at a very young age
And I hate to admit this, but he's actually really good at it
What about the fact that you two are brothers?
Come on You've never heard of adoption?
Why? Why would he do all this?
Listen, what you have to understand
is that my brother and I had a very difficult childhood
And to deal with it, he created
this persona for himself Lucifer Morningstar, the Devil,
incorrigible and invincible
So he's a liar?
Chloe, he means well,
but in the end, the only person
he ever truly lies to is himself
Decker
You tracked our dealer's phone? Great
I'm on my way
Any other questions?
Yeah
Why tell me all this now?
Because you needed to know
When I woke up a week later,
they'd written in a a wisecracking neighbor
You know, he-he got all the best lines
Your heart goes out to him, doesn't it?
A dealer trying to find a buyer at an AA meeting,
people at their most vulnerable that's really low
Yeah It's also not something my mum would even care about
Because and I can't believe I'm saying this
The killer isn't your mother
Unfortunately, I think you're right
Dear me, this has all been a wild goose chase
Hey
There's still a killer out there, Lucifer
And we tracked his phone to this room
We've got to figure out who the dealer is
It was the lowest point in my life
Thanks, David
Thanks, David
All right, does anybody else want to speak?
Yes, I'd like to say something
Thank you
Hello
My name is Lucifer Morningstar
and I
love drugs
Love them! Mmm!
Yummy, yummy, yummy Can't get enough
And I've got lots of money
mmm, that I love spending on drugs
Not even picky I'll do any of them
Mix them together sometimes
You ever done a he-she?
No? A neon nod? A donk?
Ah Yeah, he knows what I'm talking about
That man has definitely donked Haven't you?
Uh, the theme of the day is your lowest point
Right, my lowest point Well, geographically,
that would be Hell, of course
Hard to get much lower than that
And
Well, then I suppose it was when my mother abandoned me
Turnabout was fair play, so I
abandoned her in turn
Didn't even give her a chance to defend herself
I mean, what could she possibly say
that would justify what she did?
What would she say?
Well, that was a disaster
Actually, I thought that was really impressive
- You did? It didn't draw anyone out - Yep
That's not what I was impressed with
Hey, guys Looking to score?
Because I've got some really good stuff,
if you've got cash
Are we playing show and tell?
I got something to show you
I actually found this on the ground this isn't even mine I just
No, it-it really isn't I
Oh, okay Where-where did those come from?
Right Now I've flushed out your dealer,
do you mind if I?
Knock yourself out
Those really are not mine
Oh, of course they aren't
You don't really think I could do that to someone?
I think you were pissed off that someone blocked your meal ticket,
and I think you were trying to send a message, yeah
Yeah, but I couldn't do that That
Oh, God Is that her skull?
Can you take that away, please?
Not until you tell me what you know about
Oh, God
That poor girl
All right, if it wasn't you,
then who would want to make it look like it was?
If she had a dealer before me, you know, I
I doubt I doubt he was happy I stole his best buyer
Who was he?
Oh, there you are, Maze
I've missed you
So, where the hell have you been, Maze?
Away
Wonderfully vague,
but you'll have to be a tad more specific, I'm afraid
I needed you
Oh
So I'm supposed to just come running whenever you need me?
Yes That's exactly what you're supposed to do
- And why is that? - Because since fire and brimstone,
that's just how it is between us
Through thick and thin
So, come on Where were you?
Shouldn't you be more concerned
with the guy I just saved you from?
Oh, please I'm only vulnerable when the detective is around
So, who is he?
Amy Dodd's dick nozzle boyfriend
- Previously on Lucifer - Who escaped Hell?
Mum
Dad got pissed off and tossed me out of the house
And what did your mother do?
She just stood there and let it happen
A couple of a thousand years later, Dad kicked her out, too
So I did the same for her as she did for me: zilch
So, Mama Morningstar's on the loose
I never could break that woman
She wouldn't submit
- What are you doing here? - I've been demoted
Been reassigned to assist on cases
You lied to me about being a doctor
Do you realize
the ethical position you've put me in?
If she's not coming to kill me,
then I don't know what she's doing
That's truly terrifying
Lucifer
Mum
Help me
Hello?
- Are you okay? - He just collapsed
- Does anyone know CPR? - No, I don't know
Hello? Are you okay?
Call 911!
Uh, heart attack maybe?
I think he might be dead
Sir? Sir?
- Lucifer? - Sir, are you okay?
Lucifer? Where are you?
Sir, are you okay?
Has anyone seen Lucifer?
Lucifer
I need to find Lucifer
Man Thought I killed your ass
Hey, Mom?
Mommy
Lucifer
And that's when I started looking for you, son
At least I've managed to keep
this flesh sack in one piece
It has not been easy
Quite a few of the male species have been eying me hungrily
Do humans eat their own?
Well, say something
Aren't you glad to see me?
I apologize for my human form, but
at least this one has supreme hindquarters
You're lying
No They're quite sturdy Feel it
I wasn't referring,
nor will I ever refer, to your butt, Mother
I simply don't believe your wounded bird story
You're the goddess of all creation
Not anymore, unfortunately
Now I'm just trapped in this stinky human
with the exceptional ass
I swear, all I've done for three days is wander this cesspool,
asking these vacuous cretins how to find you
What are you doing?
Calling Amenadiel
Oh!
Wonderful He's here, too?
Yes And he'll be the one taking you back to Hell, so
What?!
Why?
Because you're dangerous and terrifying
I promise you I'm not here to hurt anyone
You have to believe me
My entire focus has been on finding you, son
So you can eviscerate me? Got it
No We've wasted enough time being estranged
I'd do anything to rectify that now
Sure you don't mean "revenge that"?
Lucifer, your father put me in Hell
Not you I know that
Yes
But I was your warden
Not by choice
We were both wronged
But you could have at least visited me
Oh, I'm sorry
When Dad cast me out, who stood by and did nothing?
Hint: it's a palindrome for "mum"
Well, maybe if you had talked to me in Hell instead of sending
your little demon torturer,
I could've explained the whole thing
You're right, you're right
But I'm here now, so by all means, explain
You wouldn't believe me
I know how suspicious and untrusting you are
You don't know anything about me
Lucifer
I'm your mother
Not for a very, very long time
Well, I want to be now
Then I'm going to need you to prove
your little origin story to me
We'll retrace your steps
If I don't find a trail of bloodshed and carnage,
then perhaps I'll believe you
Fine We'll begin where I found the tiny spear in my neck
- Fine - Hmm
Gonna need to get you some clean clothes
Humans tend to frown at the sight of blood
Yes
I've noticed
Uh, just leave it, would you?
Gosh, perhaps we shouldn't have borrowed from Maze
Her clothing is insufficient
Yes Half my hide is exposed
Human attire is very impractical
They're morons, aren't they?
Oh So you admit you revile them?
To revile them would be to care about them,
which I do not
Then all those rumors
about why Dad sent you to Hell
the plagues,
the floods they weren't you?
Well
Yeah That's what I thought
I was angry
But humans weren't
the reason your father and I were fighting
At least, not then
Uh, Mum?
Hmm?
I think you left out a minor detail
Oh, dear

Liar, liar, slutty dress on fire, Mother
Whoever destroyed my human suit
must have killed this little imp as well, it's obvious
Lucifer, honey,
why would I bring you here just to disprove my story?
I don't know
But that's exactly what I'm going to find out
Management
- Don't Wait! Wait - Why?
Because there is a dead man lying on the bed
Humans don't like that sort of thing
- Fine Then let's fly out the window - What
I don't have wings anymore, Mum
What?
It's a long story
Come on This way
Management
Yeah, this way
What happened to your wings, son?
I cut them off
Why would you? I mean, come to Earth,
get a haircut or something, but that's a little extreme
Hey, bud
Can I tag in next?
Excuse me?
With the lady
How much?
This one you could kill Come on
I'm joking!
I'm joking, Mother
Gosh
You're gonna have to lose those clothes
They're a serious problem
Taking you home,
'cause this being out in public thing obviously isn't working
And then I'm gonna see my colleague
Mum!
- Yes? - You're naked!
Well, you said the clothes were a problem, so problem solved
Get in the bloody car, will you?!
God Traumatized for eternity now,
so thank you very much for that
Maze?
Ah, good, you're still here
I have a job for you
On my way out, Lucifer No more jobs
Yes, yes, I know You don't work for me anymore
Very clear But I have a feeling you're gonna love this one
Just think of it as a parting gift
Come on
Hello, Mazikeen
Is that her?
Mm-hmm
In a human body?
Well, unfortunately
For you
I appreciate your enthusiasm, Maze, but hands off
What?
You're kidding
Millennia, Lucifer
with no physical form
But now
look at all that flesh
Yes, but sorry, dear No torture
Just don't let her out of your sight
Until I've worked out whether she's lying or not,
she can't be trusted
You want me to babysit?
Well, "my mum in the body of a disturbingly hot woman"-sit,
but yes, for now
Mmm
I was just trying to give Tammy Twinkletoes a makeover
Honey, you you popped out her eye
Yeah
That was an accident
Well, I think she looks rather fetching
Lucifer
Hello, Detective Sir Douche Offspring
You know, I bet you're actually
behind this, aren't you? Sadly, no
Can't take the credit, but I do approve
Can we get to work now, please?
I'm just wondering if there's any fresh homicides popped up
Ooh, you know, when you make that face,
you look a bit like the doll
- Hey - Ah, look
You can disco a bad guy into confessing
This isn't a game; this is parenting
And it's important
She mutilated Tammy Twinkletoes
And I'm sure there's a real mutilation
out there to solve as we speak
Something that screams
"crazed witchy woman on a rampage" perhaps?
What? Not that I know of
Okay, I'm gonna go back in there
Detective!
Just a doll
I don't know what all the fuss is about
It's not just a doll, it's manipulation
- What? - Trixie's best friend Landa got a new
All-American doll, and now Trixie wants one
So what does she do? She destroys her old doll,
- expecting me to replace it - Mm, impressive
But, then, I'd expect nothing less from the shrewd little minx
Why don't you comply, then we can get on, yes?
No And I'd appreciate it if you don't undermine my authority
But you're being a bad mother
Abandon the child in its time of need,
and it won't trust you in the future
- Is that what you want, Detective? - Decker
Yeah
Got it
New case Hotel Gleam
Ah, finally! Fantastic news
He's practically a kid
Yeah, 19 or so
How long has he been here?
I don't know, maybe a few days
Guess the maid really took
the "do not disturb" sign seriously
Cause of death: single puncture wound to the neck
I'm thinking ice pick
Or a screwdriver, perhaps
Five-inch, head?
Huh
Yeah Maybe
You're good
I know Detective,
interesting pool of blood through here
I'm assuming it belongs to Cinderella here
Cinderella? Sure we don't mean evil stepmother?
Really?
Are we really still on the whole "my mother did it" thing?
I thought she was responsible for our last murder
What, you're just throwing homicides at her
- until one sticks? - No, I'm simply saying
that the missing woman may well be our killer
A murderous psycho whose rampage started
by impaling that poor lad
Okay, my guess is that this is an affair gone wrong
Jealous husband follows his cheating wife here
He kills the young lover, he wounds her,
and then he drags her home or she escapes
Definitely the latter
Well, we would know more
if she had left more than a shoe
We don't have a purse
No wallet, no keys
Would the woman's phone help?
Well, yes, of course, but we don't have
A phone!
Wow!
Good eye, Luce!
ifer
I'll get this back to the lab
See if I can restore it
Yeah, fast as you can, Ella, we have to proceed
as if this missing woman is still alive, okay?
- Yeah - I don't want to find another body
Trust me, you will not find another body
I found a body
She's a maid at the hotel
Explains why she didn't find our dead guy
'Cause, you know, she was dead
Anyway, okay
No open wounds, so she's definitely not our Cinderella
who bled all over the place
You see the bruising
and the semi-circular marks on her neck?
- Strangled - Aha
Long fingernails, which means the killer's female
Not necessarily I mean, the marks aren't deep
It could just be a dude
- who's not serious man-groomer - Come on
It's so obvious, your Cinder-hellion
had just plunged a screwdriver into the poor lad,
when she was interrupted by the chambermaid,
who she then snuffed out with her bare hands
Chambermaid?
Who's the killer, Mrs Peacock
in the library with the candlestick?
I love that game
I really don't think it's the missing woman, Lucifer
It's a little unusual for a woman to strangle someone
But look at the size of the bruising, clearly not man hands
I've seen some guys with some pretty tiny lady hands
Dan doesn't count
- Come on - Okay, regardless,
the maid's death wasn't planned
I still think we're looking at a third party
someone attacking the couple when the maid entered
The killer then dragged the maid into the bedroom,
where they struggled until he
finally managed to strangle her
Which gave our Cinderella time to get the hell out of there
I couldn't agree less
And she needs to go straight to Hell
as soon as possible
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to make a call
Oh, did we get anything on that cell phone?
Oh, right! Uh, totally forgot
No, no
Could not recover anything from the SIM card
Water and phones, bad news
I dropped mine in the toilet once that sucked
- Damn So much for that - Had to reach in, I didn't have my gloves
Uh, no
No, 'cause I did get a serial number off of it,
so I know who bought it, at least
Richards and Wheeler
High-end law firm in Beverly Hills
Cool
Next time, if you want, you know,
you can just lead with that information
If you want
Okay, boss, where do you want me?
I'm not your boss, I'm just, you know, kind of
My boss
It's okay, Chloe
I've accepted my demotion like a big boy
And besides, it's kind of hot when you give me orders
Sorry
Old habits
Why don't you start with missing persons,
see if there are any new leads on our Cinderella
Lucifer and I will go to the law firm
- Okay - Okay
Lucifer
- Lucifer - Hmm?
Oh Uh, are you praying or?
Yes Usually works
He must've gone for a wank or something
Come on, Amenadiel, where are you?
Hello?
Is this thing on?
I keep waiting for God to talk back to me, too
But you know what, don't get discouraged, okay?
He is listening, it's just
a one-way intercom kind of deal
Come on, brother, where are you?
Linda
Surprised to see you're still coming in
I mean, after all, this is a
a real facility for real therapists with real patients
Unfortunately, I can't talk right now, Linda
I've got some research to do
Oh, sure, I bet
Learning more about psychiatry?
Or is it time to switch it up? Be a lawyer maybe
Astronaut
I understand
You're upset that I told you I was a therapist
Maybe you are one, 'cause your intuition's uncanny
Linda, listen I did what I had to do, all right?
Now, you wouldn't understand this,
but I was dealing with matters of great importance
I didn't have a choice
Yes, you did
You used me
You didn't have to do that
I'm used to my patients lying to me, not my colleagues
Not my friends
I confided in you, trusted you
And you betrayed that trust
It is difficult to explain,
but things have been very trying for me
Mm-hmm
Maybe if you didn't think so much about yourself
and more about how you treat others,
things wouldn't be so trying
It's called karma
Might want to research that
All right, the most effective way to do this
is with a discreet and systematic approach
Understood
We can start with the partners and then
Attention, lawyers! Hello!
Hello Attention, please
Uh, now, does anyone recognize this critical piece of evidence
found at a gruesome crime scene?
Yeah See?
That's our corporate-issue phone
We all have one
That could be anybody's
Right
What about this
Louboutin power pump
with the ombré finish in a size, uh seven?
- Six, UK - Lucifer
Oh, my God
Th-That's Charlotte's shoe
Is she okay?
Prince Charming, I presume
Richards Charlotte Richards
She's the owner of this firm
When she didn't come into the office, I just
assumed she was out of town on a case
Was this man involved in any of those cases, by chance?
- Oh, my God, is he? - Dead as a doornail
Yes Or in this case, a door screw,
'cause the hole in his neck's from a screwdriver
And I happen to think that Charlotte may well have done
Could provide us with more
information on his death
Well, I-I don't recognize him
Wait, does that mean you think Charlotte is alive?
Define "alive"
When was the last time you saw her?
I did this!
Oh, Charlotte, I'm so sorry!
All right, Bradley, listen up,
'cause I've got personal trust issues at stake here
Brad, look at me
Did you want Charlotte gone?
No No
That's the last thing I wanted
Right Then what do you desire?
T-To be with Charlotte
We were in love
Mr Wheeler,
um, would Charlotte maybe have, um
also slept with the guy in the photo?
No
We were completely monogamous
She wouldn't even sleep with her own husband
She was married already?
Yeah, but she hated that guy
Sorry about the mess
I'm sorry about those shoes
Excuse me?
Mr Richards, when was the last time
your wife was home?
Oh, God, uh
Three days ago, maybe
You didn't file a missing person's report?
She's always traveling Doesn't always tell me when
Did she tell you she was bonking her associate Bradley?
Lucifer
Did she?
I knew
What could I do?
Well, one option would be
to stab her in the neck with a screwdriver
Do you recognize this man?
Oh, God
Uh h-he came by
the house with a package for Charlotte, uh, last week
Pretty sure it was, like, a work thing
Well, it depends what kind of package, doesn't it?
- Uh, I-is Charlotte all right? - Can you account
- for the last three days? - Yeah
I've been up to my ears in puke
My kids are home sick
Uh, I haven't left the house since Monday
And not showered since, I see
Are your children home?
I'd like to confirm with them
Yeah, sure Uh, just down the hall,
and, uh, uh
When exactly did you surrender your manhood?
Excuse me?
I mean, I'm all for stay-at-home dads,
and believe me, I personally commend you
for not abandoning your children,
but that's still no reason to give up
Oh, I-I I haven't given up I'm
Mr Richards, you have an entire slice of salami
stuck to your shirt
Oh, God
Come on
Where's your closet? Up here?
Mm
Oh, goody They come in more colors
There's only one body part
- rubber should be worn on - Oh!
Not that you'd know
You've clearly castrated yourself
But don't worry I'm here to help
Hawaiian print?
The eighth deadly sin Out
Dave Matthews tribute tank
Now I'm doubting your sanity
What have we got? Ah! Here we go
This is more promising
Not worn since the?
- Wedding - That's what I thought, right
Let's have a look
Come on
Come on!
Is that, uh
Cocaine!
Oh, and the good stuff, as well
Ah, Detective, welcome to the party
Ready in a minute
You know, feeding a whole ball team isn't too big a job
when you have macaroni and cheese dinner handy
Okay, boys, come and get it!
Mazikeen, what is this strange gooey substance
that this boy is cooing about?
You watching porn?
What is this?
It's like money
Humans use it to buy things they can't afford
Wish I'd found this
before I ate out of those street bins
Humans are silly animals, aren't they?
Weak Fragile
That's what I'm counting on
Now where were we?
That's a lot of coke
Think the attorney's husband was dealing?
I don't think he's the entrepreneurial type
Thinking maybe the lawyer was
Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it would explain
why she ended up bleeding in that hotel room
Well, maybe the kid was her street dealer or something
Yeah, maybe Anyhow, Ella got a big fat print off the plastic
I'm running it through AFIS now
What's with the box?
Delivery for you
- What? - Yeah
Dan, I thought we talked about this
A united front, especially now
Hey, don't look at me
Oh, she's here! Lovely
Did the mini kitchen come, too?
Lucifer, you shouldn't have gotten her the doll
It's fine You can say it's from you
Oh Hello
Luis Mendoza
He's a known associate of drug kingpin Victor Perez
He's a scary dude
Smart though,
to partner up with a high-powered defense attorney
Which would explain why he's eluded the FBI for years
I have a friend in the Bureau
I'll call him, I'll see what I can find out
- Thank you - Mm-hmm
Oh, look, she comes with an adorable little chocolate cake
Your child's favorite
I will deal with you later
You're welcome
Eeny meeny miney
You are wasting your time, Mazikeen
You couldn't break me in Hell
What makes you think you could do it here?
Maybe I couldn't hurt you because you weren't human
Well, now you are
No, it's because I wasn't guilty of anything
Hell gives the damned what they deserve
I didn't deserve to be punished
And you know it
No
I think it's because I just didn't find your weak spot
Everyone has one
Human bodies have several
Careful
This body only heals once,
and Lucifer told you not to harm me
You may have him confused right now, but he's smart
He'll come around, see you for who you really are
A mother who loves her son
Loving mothers don't abandon their sons
I threaten your relationship with him, don't I?
Nice try
Even though you say you're on your way out,
you're still here doing his bidding
You need him
And if I stay, then he won't need you
Trust me, you won't stay
Lucifer made a deal with your ex to take you back to Hell,
and he doesn't break deals
Don't think he'd start with God
He made a deal?
Wait
Is that a weak spot?
Are those tears?
Oh!
You're a bad mother
Really? I think you might be projecting a little bit
Oh, really? How's that?
Well, you keep trying to pin murders on your own mother
I'm guessing you and her don't have the best relationship
There
At least I get to keep the cute little chocolate cake
Oh, come on
Talked to Agent Colburn
Charlotte wasn't working for the cartel
She was working to bring it down
So was that poor kid
His name's Marco Sanchez Got in over his head
with the cartel, was trying to make it right
So he was working with Charlotte and the FBI as an informant?
Trying to build a case against Perez, yeah
That's why he and Charlotte were meeting at the hotel in secret
But look at this
Perez's hit man is Jimmy the Carpenter
Want to take a guess at his MO?
- Screwdriver? - Boom
So the woman isn't a ball of homicidal fury
No Perez is
- Or his hit man anyway - Right
Well, shall we arrest the Perez chap, then?
The FBI has been trying to do that for years
He's Teflon He launders
everything through his tanning salon franchise
Yeah, we can't risk derailing the FBI's case
We have to go through the court, and we have to get a warrant
I'll see if I can rush one
Perez could have Charlotte now
Ah, I doubt it
Well, if not, he's after her
I don't doubt that
Yeah, why don't you stay here and get the warrant
I think I've left the cooker on
Ah, lovely You got one on the go
Right New information, Maze
Seems Mum might not be a lying sack of savagery after all,
but it also seems that she's the target
of a vicious cartel hit man
So you mustn't let her leave the penthouse
until this whole mess is resolved Right-o?
Your mom's gone
What?
Well, how did that happen, Maze?
She tricked me,
then head-butted me, then left
Sorry
Oh, well
Suppose the worst that could happen
is that she's brutally murdered
If so, she'll just find a new body
and run right back like a good mum, yeah?
Or not
I may have let
the whole deal with God thing slip
So I think she might be running away
So if she goes into a new body, we'll never find her
Okay Then we'll just have to find her before that happens
I mean, how far can a celestial being
trapped in a feeble human body for the first time get?
Well, let's see
She's stupid hot, wearing my clothes,
and she's got a corporate credit card
Bollocks
Hello, chaps Just looking for the head of a big drug cartel
Is he home? Vicky?
Victor?
- Oh! - Oh Sorry, love Vicky!
Ah
Ah Hello
Mr Perez, I need you to know
that I'm not here to talk to you
about your criminal drug enterprise
I'm here about Charlotte Richards
Are you, by chance, holding Charlotte prisoner?
- Who? - Right I'll take that as a no
Here's my point
You may think that she's dead, but she's not,
which is fine, because you also think
that she's still Charlotte, which she's also not
- Is that clear? - Ow!
I simply need you to promise
to stay away from Charlotte Richards Deal?
Oh Oh, look at that
Snowstorm in a tanning salon How ironic
Oh Detective
I think Vicky here is ready for a little bit of show-and-tell
Emphasis on the show
Wait a second
You think I had him killed 'cause he's a narc?
Why would I do that?
I was using him
Fed him bogus information on purpose
Had the FBI chasing after their own knobs
Kid was an asset
Be stupid to hurt him
Well, you forgot to tell your buddy Jimmy the plan
Screwdriver to the neck
The Carpenter? He's dead
Did I throw a wrench in your works?
Get it? Screwdriver? Wrench?
It's a whole theme
Ah How's my little drug kingpin panini?
Not our guy
We have to find someone connected to Marco and Charlotte
that didn't know Jimmy the Carpenter's dead
Well, Jimmy's dead? Tragic
So assuming the whole cartel knows that, it rules them out
and points us to the only way
that Charlotte and Marco are connected:
the law firm
Two shakedowns in one day I'm in
No more shakedowns, no more tanning booth shenanigans
You and I have been working together long enough
for you to know how to follow protocol
I'm sorry, Detective, but Charlotte's in danger
We need to find her
How did she go from big bad wolf to little lost lamb?
Well, maybe she's a wolf in sheep's clothing,
but right now she needs to return to the flock
Yeah, I worked on that case
I work on every case that comes through here
Okay, but the Perez case was sensitive
You were the only one here
besides Charlotte who knew about it
Which means you're also
the only one here who was aware
of Jimmy the Carpenter's methodology
Wait You don't think that I
Got handy with a screwdriver
and tried to pin it on the Perez cartel?
Yes That's insane
What's insane is
a guy with a Harvard law degree
still working as an associate
Yes Passed up for partner by old Tom Cruise out there
Guess you should've been slipping the boss your top gun
If you're suggesting that I killed
an innocent kid and my boss my mentor of 12 years
all out of professional jealousy, you're crazy
Hold on
I don't believe that we mentioned two murders
I mean, we showed you the crime scene photo of Marco,
- but not Charlotte - Lucifer
Well, given the information that you presented
the phone, the shoe I just assumed that she was
Dead? No
Just missing And if we find her alive, it's gonna be
very interesting to hear what she has to say about you,
her loyal protégé
This line of questioning is now over
Why don't you go speak to my attorney
He's two doors down
Why would you divulge privileged information to a guy
who's now clearly our lead suspect?
Sorry I'll get that protocol thing down one day
Why aren't you dead?
What? Who are you?
Don't give me that, Charlotte
By the way, thanks for using
the credit card we opened for the Perez case
Did you forget I'm the only one that has access to it?
That I'm the only one
who did anything for you at that hellhole?
Hellhole? Are you a demon, too?
Why?
Because I'm a little upset?
Wouldn't you be, too, if you got passed up by Wheeler
with the big wiener?
Oh, I know who you are now You're the one who killed me
Well, apparently not But I am now
Sorry
- Can't kill my mum - Oh!
Lucifer!
Detective
If you're gonna follow me following him,
we should have just drove together
Right, you get him, Detective!
I'll stay here and protect the poor lady!
Protect me? From what?
Ow!
What'd you do that for?
Well, the detective knows you're alive now,
so you're gonna have to sell the whole Charlotte charade
Need to explain that blood pool somehow
- Oh, you little - Devil?
Yes But about that
we've never met until now, don't know each other
I fear it's too much for the detective to handle
Well, it looks like she can handle quite a bit
Yeah
Well, it seems that wound was re-aggravated in all the hubbub
Poor woman
You want to tell me what the hell you were doing?
Well, leading the mouse to the cheese, of course
I mean, I was gonna be the cat,
but then you showed up, so I suppose that makes you the dog
What am I gonna do with you?
Well, I can think of a few things
Might need a stretch first though
You need to follow the rules
You tell me not to ravage suspects in front of you
Now I can't do it behind your back either?
I mean, make your mind up, Detective
No more buying my daughter $200 dolls
Well, why not? You weren't going to
I was teaching her a lesson
Neglect 101 You're abandoning her
in her time of need, Detective
I don't know what happened between you and your mother
And if you ever want to talk about it, I'm here for you
But listen to me
Doing what's best for your child
it doesn't always make 'em happy
I hate to interrupt so late, but, uh
I just wanted to apologize
Oh?
Yeah, you were right, Linda
You see, I really do have a lot to atone for
I've made so many mistakes lately
But a big one was hurting you
I may have forged a friendship with you
under false pretenses, yes
But I did consider you a friend
And I'm deeply sorry that I ruined that
If anyone understands mistakes, it's a therapist
Not that you'd know
Apology accepted
Thank you
Night
Good night
What on earth is that?
Cheesy noodles
It's what mothers make to bring their children joy
I saw it on the flat-screen
That explains all the cheese
Lucifer
I wish, with all my being,
that things could go back to the way things were
With you
and all my children again in Heaven
I want what your father took from me
I want my home back
But I know that's not possible
So I want to do what I can
to be a good mother to you here, on Earth
It's too late
You abandoned me, Mum
You just stood by and watched as I was cast out
Thrown into Hell and vilified for all eternity
There aren't enough cheesy noodles in the universe
to fix all that, I'm afraid
Okay
Your father never sent you to Hell
I did
Oh, great Much better
I did it to save your life
After the rebellion, your father was angry
Deeply angry
He wanted to destroy you
I begged him not to
I asked him to send you to Hell instead
I did it because I love you, son
And I always will
However
if you still need me
to return me to Hell, I understand
You do what is right for you
That's very gracious of you, Mother
Okay, but please don't send me back to Hell
But I meant the rest
I know you did
All right
All right, you can stay
For now
Just until I
figure out what I need to do
Thank you, son
Yeah

- Previously on Lucifer - Someone's escaped from Hell
- Who escaped Hell? - Mom
If she's not coming to kill me,
then I don't know what she's doing
Aren't you glad to see me?
I apologize for my human form
Chloe, I'm sorry
You don't get to be sorry
I've been demoted
I'm reassigned to assist on cases
I need to figure out where I fit in in this world
I need some space
Things have been very trying for me
 Lucifer made a deal with
your ex to take you back to Hell
And he doesn't break deals
I want what your father took from me
All right, you can stay,
just until I figure out what I need to do
I want to say I'm sorry
for all my sins
For anything I have ever done that hurt people
I was stupid
And I am sorry
I am so sorry
All I want now is forgiveness
I just want to take it all back
Please
No! Just let me take it back!
No, no, no, no! No!
There's no need for squeals
We'll stop this torture any time you like
Just say the word
Don't you dare stop
What happens if he stops?
Well, Lucifer, don't be shy
Introduce me to your friend
Lucifer, you brought a surprise
I most certainly did not bring any surprises
Oh, she's beautiful
That's my mum
you're talking about
This just got too weird
Listen, Mum, I know I chose
not to return you to Hell, yet
- Which I appreciate - But that doesn't mean
you can just waltz in here and accost my guests
I apologize
It's just that all these human rules
and customs are so confusing
Remember, I'm still getting used to this earthly skin sack
Yes, yes, you used to be a goddess
I know, but things are different now
And I will figure it out
Now that we're together again,
I just want to be part of your lives
Not this part!
Out of bounds
Wait What do you mean by "lives"?
I want to see Amenadiel
What?
It's time
I am not going to live
in fear of my own son
We may have had our differences
He literally carried you to Hell
But I created him
Certainly that has to count for something
It doesn't Bummer, right?
One look at you, and he'll take you
right back where you came from
I'm surprised he hasn't come sniffing around already
Well, what am I supposed to do, just sit here and hide?
See a movie, go to a museum
Catch up on what's happened over the past few thousand years
You'd be surprised
Yes I suppose a lot has changed
I mean, who would've predicted you would've
taken on this human job?
I'm a punisher, Mother It's what I've always done
The only thing that changed was the locale
I know what you're thinking,
but I was assisting on a stakeout that went long,
and I'm really sorry, but I promise you,
I will make it up to you, okay?
How?
Double fudge, your favorite
You're lucky I like you
Hey
Hey
Thank you for letting me do the pickup here at work
I've just been running around a lot since the demotion
You know, helping out
on everyone else's cases
Yeah It's fine, it's fine
Are we still going on our family camping trip?
Oh, uh
We're still ler working out the logistics of that
Of the trip
Look, I know that you're still mad at me
I deserve it
But this stuff between us is starting to affect Trixie
So I think that we need to talk later
Yeah, yeah We should
You're right
Uh, Decker
Okay, yeah Two seconds
I was stupid
And I'm sorry
Victim's name was Nicholas Sands, 35
Worked as an exec at the Internet startup called Wobble
Wobble?
Please tell me that's a pornography site
Oh, no, no Wobble's like a next gen Facebook, you know?
People post updates, photos, links
Mine's mostly slo-mo videos of me doing cannonballs
onto inflatable pool toys You should check it out
I'll pass, but thank you
Nick's confession was posted to his Wobble account
six hours ago, right around the time of death
Which means whoever did this wanted us to find that video
So we could see how weepy this chap was before he died
Now, that is cruel
Ella, do we know how the fire started?
Any chemicals we can trace?
So far, all we've got is paraffin oil
Which is highly flammable, but also, like, everywhere
Even in crayons, so color at your own risk
Doesn't help us narrow the suspects
Yeah, but this might
Okay, so based on the burn pattern,
which is pretty gnarly in this case,
it looks like the highest concentration of accelerant
was placed, well
here
Goodness gracious,
great balls of fire
- Lucifer - I mean, I've heard of hot pants,
but this really brings new meaning
- to the term "fire crotch," doesn't it? - Lucifer
Wait I have more
Smokey Bobinson
Weekend at Burnie's
His burning bush?
Oh Very good
That was actually me, by the way,
- so don't tell anyone - Hey, guys?
Dead body
Can you please take this seriously?
I assure you, Detective, I'm taking this very seriously
Look at this
Our killer was clearly punishing his victim
And?
And punishing is my job
So if there's someone out there
stealing my jam, I need to find out who
It's game bloody on
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
Do not touch the charred crotch
Is a sentence I never thought I'd say out loud
It's vicious work
I mean, I reserve this kind of treatment
for the truly terrible in Hell
Pedophiles, Nazis
People who put their seats back on a plane
Uh-huh Seeing as the nature of the crime is so specific,
we need to figure out who had a personal grudge
- against the victim - Hmm
Uh, by the way, you've skipped a spot, there
Oh
Yeah, it's not like you
to miss a step in the clothing department
Yes, well, I had to rush out this morning
I've got an unexpected houseguest I can't get rid of
Oh, right New lady friend that you can't shake
A rather old one, actually
Yeah, I know how complicated exes can be
What? She's not an ex
You should see this, Detective
Thanks
What is it?
E-mails from Nick's supervisor at Wobble
A woman by the name of Leila Simms
Let me guess, something riveting
about the latest quarterly report?
"How could you?
"I should have known better
You won't get away with this"
"I'll burn you starting with your man parts"?
No
- Still, that's a pretty good lead - Yep
Do not touch
the charred crotch
And Nick was so sweet and charming
How could someone do such a thing?
So, Leila, you were his supervisor
How well did you know him?
We dated briefly, a while ago
Oh
Would you say things sort of flamed out,
or did they end in more of
a blaze of glory?
Lucifer You're right, far too subtle
Why did you torture the poor young man to death?
Torture him?
Oh, God
You think I had something to do with this?
Well, we know about the angry e-mails
I was pissed off
He shared pictures of us together
Mm, mid-coitus?
If so, we'll have to confiscate those immediately
No
Just of us
at-at dinner
But I'm his boss,
and inter-office romance is frowned upon here
Well, it hardly seems worthy
of lighting a man's johnson on fire
Wait
Is that how he died?
There's something you should see
Ray, can you come in here, please?
Ray, I'm gonna need you to pull up the video
of Tommy at the company retreat
The video of Tommy?
Ray's head of our HR
Being protective is part of his job
Do it, Ray
Nick was a charmer, but he had a tendency
to be a little harsh with interns
Aka, he could be a real dick
As you'll see
Aah! Aah!
My balls! Get it off!
Come on, that is quite funny
Nick posted the video shortly after the retreat,
and even though it was quickly taken down,
everyone saw it
Tommy was a laughingstock
He quit pretty soon after
Certainly looks like motive
Huh
What can you tell me about Nick Sand's death?
Just that the bastard finally got what he deserved
Okay And why did he deserve it?
As soon as I took the job at Wobble,
Nick made it his personal mission
to make my life hell
Sabotaging my work, terrorizing me,
making me the butt of all of his jokes
Or the balls, in this case?
That stupid video was
my breaking point
Everyone saw it Everyone laughed at me!
No one's laughing now, Tommy
So after everything that happened, what,
you-you wanted to make him feel your pain?
He deserved what happened to him
Yeah, but you're not answering the question
Did you kill Nick?
I understand punishment all too well, Tommy,
and Nick deserved to be punished
He did, didn't he?
Mm He took your dignity, and so you had to
take your revenge
There was no other way to get your proverbial balls back
So tell me
did you desire
I killed him
Oh
Well, that took
all the fun out of it
That did not go how I expected
Oh, come now, Detective He obviously wanted people
to know that he got his revenge
Now our would-be punisher's brought to justice,
and the field is mine again
What on earth is she doing here?
Charlotte Richards
The defense attorney we saved, remember?
She must be back here defending some scumbag
But why are they all being so chummy?
Well, she used to be a cop, and, oh, yeah,
'cause she's a knockout
Personally, I'm surprised that you haven't tried
Pardon me, pardon me Excuse us
Charlotte, hello Do you mind if we have a quick word?
What are you doing here, Mother?
I thought we agreed you'd do something constructive
with your time, like mall walking or a studio tour,
perhaps, but
How did you even find your way here?
Well, it wasn't difficult
I simply smiled at a male human and asked him to take me
Need I remind you that Charlotte Richards has a husband out there
who's wondering where she popped off to
And you have a son who wants to take you back to Hell
So drawing attention to yourself in a police station
in this little getup, not a good idea
But I had to see it for myself
My boy, working, toiling,
amidst humanity's muck
Well, I hope it's everything you imagined and more
Now go see Cabaret I'm sure you'll find it riveting
I just don't understand
Of all the things that you could do with your talents,
law enforcement?
Have you considered I might enjoy exploring humanity?
They eat, darling
All they do is eat
And then afterwards, the food comes out changed
and not for the better
Detective
I didn't realize
you and Charlotte knew each other so well
Oh, we do and we don't It's a long story, really
Right, shall we go somewhere
to, uh, celebrate solving the case?
No Not yet
Tommy was humiliated
Makes sense why he'd want to kill Nick
But something just doesn't sit right
Detective, you, of all people, should know how good it feels
to punish someone who's wronged you
- How so? - Oh, come now
You may not be roasting Dan's chestnuts yet
but a shoulder shrug here, a dismissive look there
- could be just as effective - Okay, fine
Maybe I've been a little hard on Dan lately, but he deserves it
And I'm sure you found it very satisfying
But have you considered
for just one moment
how your fighting affects those caught in the middle?
You mean Trixie?
What? No, I mean me
Think how terribly bored I am by it all
Ah, look, there he is Now's your chance
to stop with your "will they, won't they" nonsense
It's not that simple
I'm avoiding a difficult conversation
Well, I
Hi
There's something you got to see
Another apology video dropped along with another body
I know it was wrong!
I shouldn't have posted that video!
She didn't deserve to be humiliated like that
I'm sorry
Two murders
Same MO
But Tommy was already in custody when this guy was killed
There's no way he did this
Tommy wanted his dignity back
Whoever did this
clearly had a much grander objective in mind
Ladies and gentlemen,
it looks like we're tracking a serial killer
Victim's Adam Wiser, 29,
worked as an assistant at a local bank
Time of death was two hours ago, but apparently he's been missing
for almost two days
Ooh, that's a long time on a sex rack
Not a record, but quite impressive
Ella, we know the cause of death?
Well, he's got broken ribs, a ruptured spleen
and possible cranial bleeding, which would all totally suck
And yet, this dude asphyxiated
He was choked with an apple?
No
More like an orchard
We're gonna have to cut him open to get the rest
That's messed up
Certainly brings new meaning to the term "deep throat"
Why not just kill the guy?
Why all the pomp and circumstance?
Well, our punisher's clearly sending a message
Perhaps if we find the video that Apple Boy
is apologizing for, we'll know what that message is
- Hold this - What are you doing?
The original video was filmed on Nick's phone, right?
What if Adam's doing the same thing?
Be careful, Detective
Might be a booby trap
The video's already cued up
Look at this
Notice anything familiar?
The ball gag's amaranth
Just like the apple
What, so our killer's paying homage to a bloody sex tape?
He's recreating the crimes he's punishing for
First lighting Nick's groin on fire, now this
He's upping his game
Yeah, but what's with the outfit?
I mean, other than giving me super creepy flashbacks
to Catholic school, it doesn't add up
And the woman is not wearing one in the video
She certainly looks too old to be in school
Unless she teaches at one
Her name's Sarah Aiken, 27
Third grade teacher Cute
Not hot, but extra points for proclivities
When she broke things off with Adam,
he uploaded his revenge porn to Wobble
Some teachers caught wind of it, and she was fired
Well, maybe she took out both Nick and our loathsome ex
You know, no harm, no foul
And no dice because she had no connection to Nick
And shortly after she lost her job, she killed herself
What, so our poor, sexy teacher's dead,
and our apple-chomping schoolboy's responsible?
And the only other connection we were able to find
is that both victims posted their illicit videos to Wobble
So, maybe some sicko saw both videos
- and decided to take action - "Sicko"?
Sounds to me like someone's doing our job for us
We don't exact vengeance, Lucifer
Well, maybe we should
As far as I'm concerned,
these little wankers got exactly what they deserved
See you later
Hey, where are you going?
We have to find out who did this
Well, I thought someone out there
was stealing my job, but far be it for me
to stand in the way of excellent work
I'm off for a drink
No
Honestly, I'm impressed
It's hard going out on your own
Changing old habits
I admire the steps you're taking
Well, don't admire too much
I'm still coming to Lux
Hmm, yes
Baby steps are fine
Plus, the view here is nice
The real key is to avoid setbacks
Setbacks that are tall, blond and have a special place
in Hell? Mm
Hi, Maze
Hi, human
I need to get rid of that bitch
Now I know why you're still here
Why?
You and Lucifer are very close
It's normal that you be jealous of a new girlfriend
- I'm not jealous - Ah Mm-hmm
And she's not his girlfriend
She's just toxic
Lucifer doesn't see it, but I do
Oh, so you want to protect him?
I want her to get what she deserves
Which, at the very least, is a head-butt
I'll be right back
Okay, okay
Okay, maybe
we should start with our words
Perhaps as Lucifer's friend, you can talk to him
Express how you feel
He won't listen
But maybe someone else will
Where are you going?
Taking your advice
Hey, Man Bun
Take care of my friend
Why do I even try?
Because you're an incredible woman
Oh
Thanks
So, I reached out to Wobble to cross-reference who saw
both Nick and Adam's videos
- And? - They lawyered up
Hid behind privacy laws, and without a warrant,
Wobble won't let us anywhere near their viewership data
Okay, pull the warrant, and I'm on my way there
No problem
Dan
Um
So I've been thinking about the trip,
and, um
I don't think it's fair to put Trixie
in the middle of our problems, you know?
So you want to skip it
No, I want to spare us all heartache and
I just feel like if we go on the trip
and, you know, we pretend everything's fine,
then we're just lying to her
Yeah
All right
Excuse me
Excuse me Mom
Oh
What do you think you're doing?
I'm taking your lead, son
Learning about your beloved humanity
By dancing at my club?
Well, I saw all the people
on the tables smiling and I wanted to discover
what they were so happy about
Oh, is it possible it's the money that I pay them?
It's possible
But I have to admit that when I started dancing,
rubbing up against the other humans,
I got a tingling sensation
Okay, that's enough
Excuse me, excuse me, thank you
I don't understand
I thought you'd be pleased by my effort
Disturbed is more like it
Are you actually trying to systematically disrupt
- every part of my life? - No
I'm trying to learn about every part of your life
Oh, right
How's that going for you so far?
Well, quite illuminating, actually
I understand now why you have this provocative club
I understand why you amused yourself
with that curvaceous savage
But what I don't understand
Is my human job Yes, I know
I'm a civilian consultant
But why do you still punish people?
It's what I've always done
That's not true
That's who your father wanted you to be
Are you still trying to win him over?
Careful, Mother
Why?
Are you going to punish me?
I'm sorry, Detective
I looked into the two videos in question,
and unfortunately, there was no overlap
Doesn't make any sense
I'll need a list of everyone who saw the videos
Sadly, we don't track people, just IP addresses
Maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way
Can you take me through how your video process works?
Well, our users can upload anything they want
And if we find that the content's inappropriate
uh, anything from animal cruelty to beheadings
it gets taken down
By who?
Our content moderators
Huh
Most of them only last a few months
Frankly, most people
can't stomach something so dark or upsetting
Right
God, that has got to smart
Can I see that again?
Lucifer?
Oh, Detective You're here
Did you know that this room
collects all the best parts of the Internet?
- Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah, yeah
But you got to see this a-a naked man
thinks he can jump on the back of a rhino
You'll never guess what he lands on
Actually, you probably will
What? You've seen it already?
What are you doing here?
Trying to catch our killer
- Duh - I thought you didn't care
whether this sicko was brought to justice
Oh, I don't But then I realized that our killer may have the answer
to a question that I'm, you know, struggling with
Mm
Why does he punish?
That's it?
First you want to teach this vigilante a lesson,
and now you want to have a talk with him?
Yes And lucky for me, I found out where you were headed
I mean, these videos are enthralling
No, I-I can't I can't watch these
Oh, I've seen worse
But never so many collected in one single room
You know, if I ever go back to Hell,
I am getting me one of these
Selfish bastards get to see everything
Yeah
They do
I know where the overlap is
Amenadiel, I know you're in there
Open up!
Hey
What are you hiding?
Nothing
Oh
I see what's going on with you
- You do? - Sure
Humans say that rebound sex is important after a breakup
You don't have to hide that you're getting some
I'm not
Right
Of course I didn't want you to feel awkward
Silly me
So what are you doing here?
I have a problem
I need your help
There's a new
woman in Lucifer's life
I want her gone, but he won't listen to me
And why do you care? I thought you were
stepping away from both of us
I am
- But before I do, I need you - I'll talk to him
Yeah
Well, that was easy
I'm his big brother, Maze
I really should start looking out for him more often
Okay
Thank you
All right Thanks
Dan's working with Wobble to trace
what moderator may have pulled both videos
Hopefully, we'll have an answer soon
Then why are you so sure the killer's
one of these misanthropes?
Well, serial killers
usually start with someone they know
If the killer worked here, they knew Nick,
saw how much the prank hurt Tommy
So you think seeing someone they recognized
in one of these twisted videos finally made them snap?
Maybe it awakened something in them
Something that was always there, just fighting to get out
But
they were just trying to do a job
Job no one else wanted
Well, maybe they chose that for a reason
No one chooses to be a sin-eater, Detective
No one wants to be custodian
of the world's filth Why would they?
Absorbing the worst humanity has to offer, day in and day out
Changes you
So you think it's the job's fault
that they started to punish?
People don't arrive broken
They start with passion and yearning
till something comes along that disabuses them of those notions
Hmm
Which means that none of these people did it
Okay I'm not following
Well, look at Tim there,
with the photos of his ugly children
Ivan and his flowerpots
Poor Andrea's still hoping Destiny's Child
get back together
Don't you see?
These people still have hope
- Excuse me - Yeah
- Who's had this job the longest? - Um
maybe me
I've been at it two whole months
- Huh - Oh Anyone else?
No
Other than Leila, of course
- Leila, your boss? - Yeah She started as a moderator
before the company blew up
She was the first of us
Thanks
Leila knew Nick, she had access to the videos
If she's behind this
She's known what we've been doing every step of the way
Dan, I need you to see if you can trace the videos
to one person in particular now
We're looking at Leila Simms
I can't believe we had the killer right under our nose
And she's gone
Touché, Leila Touché
Luci?
Luci, you home?
He's not here
He left in quite the hurry before
Think it was something I said
I'm sorry Are you his latest, uh?
Trust me, I'm not his latest anything
All right
So, what are you doing here, then?
I'm having a bit of
an existential crisis, I suppose
I've been known to be a good listener
Okay
Uh
I'm having some trouble with my kids
Needed to get away from them for a little bit?
No, the opposite, actually
I'm trying to get closer to them,
but I'm not having much luck
Tell me
Are you a good son?
I try to be
Well, then perhaps you can explain
Would a good son
blindly take his father's side in a divorce?
Would a good son
send his mother to Hell?
And would a good son
stand here right before me,
without a care in the world, plotting to send me back?
Mom?
I thought I would come to Earth to be with my sons
Instead, Lucifer is obsessed with his human job,
and you're still your father's loyal soldier
I'm tired of fighting for things that I'm never gonna have
So just take me back, Amenadiel
I'm ready
No matter what happens,
I will always love you
Always
Leila took down both videos,
killed Nick and Adam, and then led us
by the nose until she had time to escape
Why didn't I realize it was her?
Because as a punisher, she's quite adept
at avoiding her own medicine
Quite impressed, really
Hey, Dan
Yeah, I just saw it I'm already working on a trace
"Judgment Day"? Oh
People should really be careful how they use that phrase
It isn't actually due for another couple of years
She's gonna kill herself live on the air
What? Well, that won't do at all
How am I supposed to talk to her if she's dead?
Glad you have your priorities in order
Thought we were dealing with someone smart and clever,
who tortured with a brutal sense of irony,
but killing herself
whilst humiliating her company
Doesn't fit the pattern
Hey, Sharon, can you pull up the video of Leila driving again?
Yeah Sure
Pause it there
What are you looking for, Detective?
Zoom in to the edge of the seat
Can you go in tighter?
Well, I know images can be deceiving,
but that looks an awful lot like a gun, doesn't it?
Leila's not our killer
She's in danger
You understand this sicko pretty well
Where do you think he's going?
Well, somewhere linked to her sins, I suppose
We barely know Leila
Who knows what the killer thinks she's done?
Well, she runs the company that hosts
humanity's worst depravities, but we know she's not there
Hey, Dan, how's the trace coming?
The IP just keeps pinging back to Wobble's main server
It's got to be a mistake
Unless it's not a mistake at all
You know, if you take away the blinky lights
and add some lost souls,
this place bares a striking resemblance to Hell
Shh Listen
My name is Leila Simms
I'm one of the co-founders of Wobble
I wanted to apologize to anybody who's watching
for for creating a forum
where evil and hate sought a refuge
And there's Queen Wobble herself
Yeah, but where's the killer?
And tonight I go down with the ship
Right alongside all of those awful sins
that-that I helped give a voice to
Please, please
P-Please, please
D-Don't make me do this
Please
There's Ray, the HR rep
Oh, goodness me, I should have known
Halitosis first sign of evil
He had all the access he needed
to find his targets and frame Leila
What are you waiting for? Shoot him
If he drops that lighter, he'll kill her
I don't have a shot
Okay, Detective, this next part will be much easier
if you're not here, so I'm gonna politely ask you to leave, okay?
I'm not going anywhere
We're gonna figure this out Just give me a second
All right, no rush
Whilst you're pondering, I'm gonna go and have a word
with our killer
That's a great idea
Sorry, say that again
I never meant to cause anybody any pain
I'm sorry I'm so sorry
Yeah
Hello, Raymond
Hate to, uh, blow up your spot,
but I have a question to ask you before you complete
this twisted little mise-en-scene
Stay back
I swear I will drop this, and she is dead
Oh, gosh, there's the halitosis
It travels, doesn't it?
You should really get that looked at, but first,
indulge me this one simple query
Why?
What?
Why are you a punisher?
I understand the longing for justice
or the joy of sweet revenge,
but no one's forcing you to do this,
so why would you take it upon yourself?
Because I couldn't take it anymore
All that evil
is constantly spreading
I had to do something
I had to punish them
You're wrong
You didn't have to do anything
You wanted to punish them
No, that's not true
Yes, it started with Nick that was impulsive
But then you got a taste for blood,
and it felt good, didn't it?
I was doing my part
You had big plans
to go on a vengeance quest
until we came nipping at your heels,
at which point poor Leila took the fall
- An innocent! - No, you're wrong
And then what, you'd stop?
Get away scot-free?
We both know you can't stop because you love it!
Just like the people you punished
I don't! I
I do
I-I like seeing them beg for forgiveness
You see, the difference between us
is that you became part of the problem, Ray
Someone deserving punishment
You're right
I do
We all do
No, wait!
Man, you really don't shut up
Congratulations, Detective
I suppose you could say I look quite extinguished
Right
Shall we get you untied?
Burning the midnight oil?
Ha, ha, what can I say?
Being everybody's bitch really sucks
Yeah, well, it won't last forever
So I've had some time to think,
and, um I realize that
I've been really harsh lately
It's okay
No, let me finish, please
I've been really hard on you for a while now
And I've been
so upset and so angry
And I did, I felt really betrayed
I know
But I realize you've
you've been working so hard to make it right,
and I feel like, for the sake of Trixie,
that we should go on the trip
You know, we should go,
like we always have
I can't do that
Wh What do you mean?
You were right before
We shouldn't lie to our daughter
Okay
Look, I-I'm always gonna be Trixie's dad
And I'm always gonna be part of your lives
But we've been living in the past for too long
We're no, we're no good for Trixie
if we're no good for each other
But I think we both know the truth
It's time we get a divorce
Hello, Luci
Tell me you didn't do it
Do what?
Don't play stupid with me
You know exactly what I'm talking about
Easy, Lucifer
Your brother didn't send me to Hell,
if that's what you're worried about
But you were so adamant
I told you, Lucifer,
a mother's love counts for more than you think
My time on Earth has helped me to realize
that Father has a tendency to overreact
So you're going against Dad?
Things change, brother
Do they?
Well, I for one am grateful that we're all just
in the same room, together, as a family again
Yes, not so fast, Mother
You see, I did make a promise,
and I am a man of my word
I told you that you could stay here
until I figured out how to
reconcile my deal with Dad,
and now I have
So you're going to punish me anyway?
I am, indeed And not because
I've been brainwashed by Dad or I'm trying to prove anything
I punish because I'm good at it
I like giving people their due
Makes me happy
I suppose I can't ask for a better reason
Which brings me to your sentence
Mother
you shall remain right here on Earth
amongst the creatures you so despise
as one of them
Wait
You're going to send me
into the life of Charlotte Richards?
Mm-hmm
- Well, how's that supposed to work? - Not my problem
And what if I refuse?
You can't fight this, you're human now
But that husband
And there's children, right?
They're going to need things
Oh, I'm counting on it
But if you truly want to be with your sons,
then that's the price that you have to pay
So be it
Your money or your life, bitch
I-I choose money
Does anyone choose life?
- That doesn't very - Come here!
I'll give you what you want! Just hold on
I said, hold on!

I think He wants me to bring our jailbird back 
Mum
MOM: What are you hiding?
AMENADIEL: Nothing (screams)
LINDA: I admire the steps you're taking
It's hard going out on your own
MAZE: I need to figure out
where I fit in in this world,
and to do that, I need some space
You see, I did make a promise
I told you that you could stay here
until I figured out how to reconcile my deal with Dad,
and now I have
You shall remain right here,
on Earth, amongst the creatures
you so despise,
as one of them
MOM: But that husband
And there's children, right?
LUCIFER: Have you considered how your fighting 
affects those caught in the middle?
CHLOE: You've been working so hard to make it right 
You were right, before We've been living
in the past for too long
It's time we get a divorce
Previously on Lucifer
So, we're still good to be roomies, right?
What are you talking about, roomies?
We shook on it
You shall remain right here,
on Earth, amongst the creatures
you so despise
Existing in this punishment
allows me to be closer to my family
You made a deal to return Mom to Hell
In exchange, Chloe's life was spared
You still haven't delivered
on your end of the bargain
If you're so concerned,
why don't you just fly Mum back to Hell?
AMENADIEL: Because I can't!
(yelling)
What if Dad decides to
take back his side of the deal?
("Time Is on My Side" by the Rolling Stones playing)
- Previously on Lucifer - Roommates?
You and Detective Decker?
I think it's gonna be fine
With a short adjustment period
You made a deal to return Mom to hell, in exchange,
Chloe's life was spared
What if Dad decides to take back his side of the deal?
Hello, brother
Uriel
You have 24 hours,
or I'll finish what I started with your detective
- Uriel is here? - He's after Chloe,
- or that bitch you call Mom - Well, worry not,
because Uriel won't be a problem
We have a nuclear weapon
How did he beat you, brother?
I no longer have my powers
I'm letting Uriel take me back to hell
There is always another way
That's Azrael's blade
You're not planning on taking Mom back to hell
Because you made it so difficult,
now I'm gonna take out Mom and the detective
I killed him
What have I done?
We are gathered here today to mourn a great loss
Peggy, Edgar
Your single life is dead
But your life of wedded bliss
is just beginning
She's gorgeous even as a freakin' zombie
I hate her
If anyone objects to this unholy matrimony,
speak now
or forever hold your peace
Edgar!
Oh, my God, help!
Someone call the ambulance!
Please, this is real!
Somebody call an ambulance, please!
Howdy, gang
Martini, extra dry, just like I like it
Lucifer?
Doctor!
Come to join the party?
No, I'm here to check on you
- You didn't show for our session - Yeah, yeah
I know, I canceled that
Yeah, which is odd, because you never cancel
Is everything okay?
Mm!
It's fine, just a little family drama, that's all
Nothing to worry about
- Family drama? - Mm
My brother died
Amenadiel?
Mm!
No, no
No, I another brother
I have many
Lucifer, I'm so sorry
Oh, it's fine, what's done is done, eh?
Whiskey?
No, no, you Lucifer, patients
often avoid sessions
precisely when they need it the most
When the feelings are too painful
Are you sure you don't need to talk?
Well, I think there's a few other things I'd rather do,
- you know - No, no
- Okay, Lucifer, no, no, no - Come on
No, we're not doing that anymore, and you know that
Now, I'm here
if you want to talk about your brother's death,
but in a
in an appropriate manner
Oh, what's the point?
You wouldn't understand me, anyway
You think everything I say is a metaphor
Now if you don't mind,
you're killing my buzz
Ladies
Well, if you change your mind,
my door is always open
Well, feel free to shut it
Look, Mommy, I'm swinging!
Hey, baby, get off of that
Hey
Can you let Maze and Mommy talk for a minute?
- Please? - Mm-hmm
Okay
Seriously?
A sex swing?
I know, right?
You want to hop on?
Okay, if we're gonna live together,
we need to have some house rules
Rule number one, and I can't believe I'm saying this,
no sex swing
You said I could bring my furniture
A sex swing is not furniture
We have to agree on what's gonna be in the common area, Maze
Fine, I don't agree with your cheesy decorations
You don't like Halloween?
Of course I do
Slutty outfits, humans abandoning their inhibitions,
masquerade orgies
That's great
But that's not our Halloween
You live with a child now
You're gonna have to rethink how you look at things
Oh
Do I?
Maybe living together was a bad idea
Now that's something we can agree on
Decker
This is Peggy Russo
She's a movie makeup artist from Studio City
Died from a single shot to the chest
Still waiting on ballistics, but it looks like
it's a large caliber bullet, most likely from a rifle
- Anyone see the shooter? - Ah, we're still combing through
the guest list, but so far, no
Everyone was focused on the ceremony
- What about the wait staff? - Questioned them first, nothing
But we're running everyone's info, see if we have any priors
Great
Dead center shot
You said, the what? The groom was hit in the arm?
- Yeah - So he botches the first shot,
and aces the second?
Maybe the bride
was the intended target, and the groom just got in the way
Where is he now?
Uh, he's over with the medics
I can't believe she's gone
Why would anybody
want to do this?
Did Peggy have problems with anyone?
Anyone you know of that would've wanted to hurt her?
No
Peggy's amazing
She's beautiful
and smart
and funny
Sorry I'm sorry I have to ask you these questions
Oh! Devil's food cake
I've definitely come to the right place
There we go
Oh, Lucifer
So good of you to show
You realize you're late, yeah?
Oh, and you're eating possible evidence
- What? - Give me that
Surely all this food
can't go to waste, Detective
You look like hell
Not heard that before
- Are you drunk? - I wish
Pesky supernatural metabolism keeps getting in the way
Still doesn't stop me trying, though
No!
No drinking at a crime scene
Fine
What murder are we solving today?
I mean, everyone here looks dead
We've have an injured groom and a deceased bride
Oh, they got to that "till death do us part" nonsense
quickly, didn't they?
The bride suffered a gunshot wound to the chest
Chest? Shooter didn't go for the head?
First rule of zombie killing
Do you want to work this case with me or not?
Of course I do
Every killer must be punished
Good
Then you stay here
Find some water
Calm down
I'm gonna talk to some witnesses,
and pull yourself together
You look like a homeless magician
Well
hello, bridesmaids
So, which one of you horrifying zombettes
wanted the bride dead then, hey?
Surely she put each of you through hell
All brides do, am I right?
Yeah, let me guess
She wanted you lose weight,
didn't she? You to cover your tattoos
Forced you to buy a tea-length dress
that does nothing for your cankles
And did any of you want to wear this
hideous zombie makeup?
Oh, hello
You look suspicious
Tell me, what did you want to do to our corpse bride?
I wanted to ruin her wedding
Ah-ha, right
Let me guess, you were in love with the groom
This is always about jealousy, isn't it?
No! It was Peggy
Oh, much more interesting, go on
She was so disgustingly
perfect, I hated it
How could anyone compare?
So remove the competition, got it
I told her ex-boyfriend Jason
- where the wedding was gonna be - Hmm
Hoping he'd I don't know, show up and make a scene
Oh
But I never imagined that he would kill her
This is all my fault
Oh No, no, no, no, come, come
Don't do that
Guilt is such a useless emotion
It's completely unflattering on such a beautiful face
You
you think I'm beautiful?
Oh!
Lucifer, what are you doing?
Detective, I've found you a lead
Where in her mouth?
Yes, actually!
Imagine what I can find in other orifices
Ooh!
Okay
I apologize I'm just being thorough
Call me Easy!
What has gotten into you?
I thought you were getting the hang of this
I got you a lead, didn't I?
The ex-boyfriend, you looking into him?
Yeah, Dan's on it, but that's not the point
This whole new thing, you making out with witnesses?
Completely inappropriate
When are you going to get it? Inappropriate is what I do
You've always been a pain in the ass, Lucifer,
but I've never seen you like this
What's going on? What happened?
Just enough of the questioning, Detective
Reprimand me or let's get on with it
Wow
Can I talk to you, please?
Pull your pants up
Hi
Hey, what's up with him?
Looks like he just rolled out of bed or something
I don't know
There's just something
completely off about him today
Yeah, well, there's something's
really off about him every day
No, no, it's different
He's missing his usual
extreme glee
- He-he just seems really dark - Look, is he gonna be a problem?
'Cause you know I wouldn't mind if you send him home
- Nope, not a problem - You sure?
Yep, got it I can handle it
What'd you get from ballistics?
I confirmed
large caliber bullet from a rifle, long-range
I have a team searching a wider perimeter for more evidence
And I finished
the background check on everyone at the wedding
All clean
But the ex-boyfriend, Jason Myers, he's not
He's got one aggravated assault, two weapons violations
I have him waiting in interrogation for you
Well
hello, bad guy
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
Lucifer, open the damn door!
Lucifer!
Lucifer, open this door right now!
Lucifer, what are you doing?
Just having a little chitchat
with our friend here
Care to know what I've learned?
You get out of there now
Oh, she's so demanding
Well he's innocent
Oh, did you figure that out
before or after you tortured him?
You tortured a suspect?
I didn't lay a finger on the spineless cretin
Come on, the guy's sitting on the floor crying
Crying because of a woman,
not me the bride, to be specific
However, he did not kill her
And you know that how?
He said he couldn't take seeing the bride so happy,
so he ran off, crying Surprise, surprise
Well before the shooting started
And you believed that?
- Of course not He had an alibi - Really?
Yes Leaving the park on the service road,
he bumped into a wedding musician
Didn't get a name, but he had a buzz cut and a guitar case
A guitar? No
They booked a DJ, not a live band
Trust me, crying guy isn't lying
Maybe, but maybe there wasn't a guitar in that case
Oh, so you think our musician might be the shooter
He's pretty shaken up, but he's gonna be okay
You're lucky
Okay, I still have to question properly
But there's a possibility that Jason saw our shooter,
and he may have been carrying his rifle in a guitar case
Last seen on the park service road
I'm on it
- You're welcome - Excuse me?
What you just did in there is incredibly inappropriate
Are you trying
to get in trouble or are you trying
to piss me off?
I did what I had to do
Got results, didn't I?
If you pull one more stunt like that,
I don't care how effective you are,
I will bench you
I take it you heard about Uriel?
Is Lucifer here?
No, he's out
Probably in the middle of some three-way,
like nothing happened
Not everyone grieves the same way
Lucifer, he's never been one to
face his emotions
Instead of looking in, he acts out
You know, a rebellion here,
an apple there?
But you
How are you doing?
Come on, tell your mom
When I first heard of Uriel's death,
I wanted to blame Lucifer
But then I realized I was just as much to blame,
if not more
None of this would have happened
if I still had my
Your powers
How did you know?
A mother knows
But I also know it's possible
to regain your strength
That we both can
No, Mom, it's too late
Uriel would
He would still be alive if it wasn't for me
Come, there's something you need to see
Okay, so we found something near the service road
Look at this
It's a nice little hiding spot behind some bushes
Disturbed ground
Clear view of the stage
Someone with a rifle could've made this shot
What's that?
That
is a pastry napkin from a Dutch food truck
"Freddy's Dutch Oven"?
Love this place Unfortunate name,
but best stroopwafel in Hollywood
The napkin is definitely from today
The syrup is still wet to the touch
And undoubtedly tasty
So if the shooter bought this stroop whatever you call it
With his credit card, we can track his identity
So we need to get to the food truck
and talk to the owner
I will put out a BOLO
What is it with you and BOLOs?
Why don't you just use Freddy's Dutch Oven app?
Gives you their current locale
You never know when you're in the mood
for a good strooping
You know what?
You stay here
Don't move I'll do the talking
Fine by me
Detective Decker, LAPD Are you the owner?
Alfred Loomis, but you can call me Freddy
And let me guess You look like
a "chocolade hagelslag" kind of girl
Am I right?
Sir, earlier today you served a man
with a buzz cut, possibly carrying a guitar case
Does that ring a bell?
If I may, one order of "oliebollen," please
What?
Oliebollen
Literally means "oily balls"
Tastes better than it sounds, believe me
- Thank you - No, sorry, Detective,
I don't remember anyone like that
But I wasn't here during the morning shift
Um, Freddy, I forgot to tell you
a guy like that was here when I opened
He was asking when you'd be around
Asking for me specifically?
Actually, you know what? Make the two orders, please
I'm famished
Lucifer
Everybody down!
Shooter on the roof Victim in the truck
Secure the scene!
Bloody hell!
Not very polite of Mr Shooter to leave
without saying good-bye
His bullets are saying plenty
Well, why shoot Food Truck Freddy,
just 'cause you were questioning him?
No, this was premeditated
The shooter came here to find him,
then went to shoot the bride,
then came back when he knew Freddy would be here
This guy's got a list
God, who's next?
He's not gonna tell you
Come bloody on!
What are you doing?
That's twice now today I've been denied snacks
You got change for a hundie?
Oh, God
All right, ballistics confirmed the same rifle was used
in both shootings, but no prints were found on the rooftop
This guy paid cash at the food truck
He really covers his tracks
If I could just find a connection
between our two victims
But Peggy Russo and Freddy Loomis
seem to have nothing in common
Apart from being dead
Uh, maybe they were just randomly chosen
Mm, my gut says no
This guy is too calculating
Deliberate
Until we find a link between these t
Teeny-tiny doughnuts, or cool ranch puffs?
Lucifer, you can't just steal food
- in the middle of the precinct - Why?
Are you gonna put me on the naughty step,
so I can have a think about what I've done?
Hey, Monkey
Yes, yeah, I-I'm really sorry
Work got busy
Yes, I really, really want to take you trick-or-treating
But if Mommy or Daddy can't make it home in time,
Babysitter Shelly might have to take you, okay?
Oh, she already left
- What? Why? - I don't know
But when she went into Maze's room,
she ran out screaming
It was hilarious
- Who's watching you now? - Maze
Can she take me trick-or-treating?
- No - Mommy, please?
I promise I'll be good
Yeah, babe, it's not you that I'm worried about
Please, please, please, please?
All right, put Maze on the phone
Yeah?
What did you do to the babysitter?
Me?
She's the one who didn't knock
I had no time to hide my toys
Okay, Maze, look, I have a favor to ask you
That's Lucifer's thing
I know, but I'll never find a sitter this late
And trick-or-treating is really important to Trixie, Maze
Will you please take her for me?
Sure, I'll take your offspring for a walk
Well, she's not a dog, but thank you
Okay, don't let her out of your sight,
please check her candy, and take her early,
- like 3:00 - Great
Best after-parties don't start till 3:00 anyway
Not 3:00 am, 3:00 pm
I want her home before dark
And do not take her to any parties
Lame
But whatever, your kid
Thank you Thank you so much
Oh, oh, did you see the costume? I laid it on the bed
Uh
What's wrong?
I told Mommy I wanted to be a princess when I was seven
Now I'm eight
And?
Halloween's supposed to be the one night you get
to be whatever you want
What do you want to be?
Where did he go?
Hey I've been talking to the food truck owner's wife
She doesn't recognize the zombie bride,
and doesn't think she has any connection to her husband
Two victims, two devastated spouses
Maybe we're looking at this the wrong way
Mrs Loomis, I'm sorry
I know you're going through a lot
I have one more question for you, okay?
Do you recognize this man?
Yes, that's Edgar Romero
How do you know him?
We've worked together
I'm a doctor
He's a lawyer
He handles many
of our hospital's malpractice suits
He's married
- to the other victim? - Yes, but
the connection we've been looking for
isn't between them,
it's between you, the spouses
So, you think the shooter's upset
because of one of these malpractice suits?
Maybe Maybe he's taking it out
on their loved ones
Can you give us a list of all the cases
that Edgar litigated for you?
When are you gonna tell me what's going on with you?
Do you want to talk about it?
Why would I want to do that?
'Cause that's what partners do
They talk
I can tell you about my headaches
living with Maze and you can tell me
what's going on with you
Pass
Lucifer,
seriously,
whatever you're going through
I don't know, maybe I can help
How?
By giving me a warm, fuzzy hug?
They won't release the damn case files
Some crap about new HIPAA laws requiring extra warrants
It could be days before we get a judge to sign off on that
Oh, well, it looks like Detective Douche is the one
who needs a hug Mm, come here, Daniel
- Mm - Get off me, man
Uh, Daniel, if you want to talk about your feelings,
Detective Decker is offering
Why don't give you two a minute
so you can talk about your
earth-shattering problems
- What was that? - I told you
something's going on with him
- I'm getting worried - Yeah, well,
honestly, Chloe, we have bigger things
- to worry about right now - I know
I'll see if I can expedite the warrants,
and, uh, call the lieutenant
Right Here you go
Merry Christmas
Or should I say, Happy Halloween
Are these the files?
Where did you get these?
Well, if you ask permission, people can say no,
but flash a badge to the right sap
and voilà
This is mine
All right, chill out, Daniel
What's a little badge borrowing between friends?
I mean, at least I didn't have to use this
You stole my gun and my badge?
What the hell is the matter with you?!
Hey, guys
Are you gonna take his side in this right now?
- Is that what you're doing? - Well, I got the files,
didn't I? I did what I had to do
Oh, please, don't give me that crap
You never do what you have to do,
Lucifer
You only ever do what you want to
That is not true
There's a lot of things that I didn't want to do
- Oh, really? - Yes
Because if I only ever did what I wanted to do,
then right now, I'd do this
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Why are you so surprised, Detective?!
I'm the Devil, remember?
I'm evil!
No, what you are is off this case
You go home now You're done
Go!
Are you okay?
- Not really - All right, well
let's get you checked out and return the files
What if we hold off for a bit?
I don't agree
with what Lucifer did
But there's still a killer out there
And these files might be the key to stopping him
Are you suggesting we keep them?
More like borrow
Where are we going, Mom?
You'll see soon enough
But first, we need to get something straight
Uriel's death was not your fault
How can you say that, Mom?
Do you remember when you boys were young?
Uriel always playing pranks on Lucifer
to get your Father's attention?
Annoying little runt
And he never got in trouble for it
because you took the blame
Just looking out for my little brother, Mom
No, it's more than that
You have welcomed responsibility your entire life
Don't you think you deserve a break?
Mom, you just don't understand
Don't you think I feel responsible, too?
All of this fighting has been
over me
Uriel is gone forever because of me,
not you
How can you say that, Mom?
You did everything
that you could do
You volunteered to go back to Hell
You stepped up and did the right thing
Isn't that all you've been doing?
Trying to please your Father
by doing what you think is right?
You shouldn't be punished
You should be rewarded
You really think so?
If your Father was down here
he would see that
This is where Lucifer buried your brother
Uriel?
I am so sorry
Oh, no
No worries
It's not your fault
Okay, so, these are all the cases that involve
both Dr Loomis and our zombie groom Edgar
Six settled, three pending and that last one there
was recently dismissed
Wrongful death suit thrown out for lack of evidence
That's frustrating
- Could be motive - Yeah I don't know
Maybe our plaintiff was pissed about the dismissal,
decided to settle his grievances another way
Let's see plaintiff, Wes Williams
He sued for his wife Cassandra's death
after she lost a battle with
Oh man, I can't even pronounce this
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis?
- Yeah Lung disease - Yeah, well, it looks like
Wes blamed Cassandra's physician,
our Dr Sidney Loomis, and the hospital's lawyer,
Edgar Romero, got the case thrown out
It's no one's fault for a disease like that
Yeah, well, apparently,
Wes didn't feel that way
What's wrong?
Nothing, I just
I kind of feel bad for the guy's situation, you know?
I mean, I-I don't know what I would do if my wife
Yeah, right
Well, what you wouldn't do is start revenge killing
a bunch of innocent people
Good point
Okay, let's see if our Wes Williams is in the system
No criminal record
But he fits the description
Look at that
He's an ATF agent
Nicknamed "The Ghost"
He served multiple assignments in Mexico
trying to take down the cartels
Specializes in
long-range marksmanship
Let's go
Go! Other side
Hallway clear
Clear!
Clear! Clear
He's making counterfeit badges
for Strode Pharmaceuticals
Trick or treat!
Oh, and what are you, young lady?
She's the president of Mars
Duh
Yeah
duh
President of Mars!
All right
Isn't this fun?
I expected worse
I wish you wore a costume
Well, I, uh
I did bring something
Do you want to see it?
Yeah
Turn around
I'm ready
Cool!
We're gonna get so much candy
Why?
Why did you bring me here?
You have been so focused on blame
you haven't let yourself grieve
This isn't right
None of it
Why did he do this?
Lucifer was just trying
No, Mom
Not Lucifer, Father
How did He let this happen?
Son, it's okay
Just let it out
Let it all out
I blame Father for this
You're right, Mom, where is he?
If he wanted to, he could've prevented
all of this from happening
All the misunderstandings, all the pain
Well, I'm done
I'm done trying to please someone who isn't ever here
Out
All of you out! Go on!
Go!
Anything connecting our shooter
- to Strode Pharmaceuticals? - Yeah Right here
Wes Williams' took part in one of their clinical drug trials
A "promising new treatment" for her lung disease
Not promising enough to save her
No Turns out she was in the placebo group
Is that why he's pissed off? Who put her there?
No one, really It was a double-blind,
so just like the doctor and the lawyer, no one's at fault here
So who does our shooter think is at fault?
Who ran the trials?
Dr Jack Peterson
And since Williams is targeting spouses,
if we find Mrs Peterson, assuming
- No, wait crap - What?
It also says that the trial was run by a Dr Sally Peterson
They're a husband and wife team
Great Who's the target?
Well, it could be either one We got to get to both of them
Yeah, before he does
Dr Peterson?
- LAPD - Your wife, Sally
- Where is she? - What's going on?
I'll explain later Where's your wife?
Probably getting a coffee from
the coffee cart in the lobby
Okay, you stay with him I'll find her
- You be careful - Right
You stay put
- Here you go - Thank you
I know you're out there, Mr Sniper!
Oh, come on!
You can do better than that!
Shoot me!
Well, go on, then!
What are you waiting for?
Just shoot me right now Please!
- Lucifer, what are you doing? - Uh-oh!
Police are here!
Gonna have to hurry up, Mr Shooter, sir
Seriously? I mean, I'm standing right here
Right You're just embarrassing yourself, now
I mean, could you be any worse of a shot?
Oh, come on
Che It's like he's not even trying
Not her, you idiot me!
Shoot me!
Drop your weapon now
You
Why didn't you shoot me?
- Shoot you? - I was standing
right here, fair game Why didn't you do it?
Because you didn't deserve it
How do you know what I deserve?
I was trying to scare you away from her
I only wanted the people who killed Cassandra to suffer like
What?
Like I'm suffering
You idiot!
- Lucifer - The doctor,
the lawyer, that woman They didn't kill your wife!
They aren't responsible!
But you know that
You hold someone else accountable, don't you?
If I hadn't been on mission so long
Been home when Cassandra needed me
we could've detected it sooner
She would still be alive
Yes
So it's not vengeance you want
It's punishment
Well, now you've got it
Good for you
I got this
Hey
How did you find us?
Just called the station chief
Got all the details
What you just did was extremely reckless and stupid
But you saved that woman's life
I couldn't care less about that woman's life
So, what, you were just trying to get yourself killed?
No
I don't buy it
Every time you say that you don't care,
or that you're evil, or you're the Devil,
I know that's not who you really are
You don't know a thing about who I am, Detective
Or what I've done
You weren't just talking about Wes back there, were you?
You want to be punished for something
That's why you've been acting out recently
Just talk to me, Lucifer, please
Just tell me what's going on
I'm here for you, okay? I
I just want to understand
You can't understand, Detective
And you never will
Well, if you won't talk to me, then
please, talk to someone else
You have a therapist
Talk to her, before it eats you alive
Now
I'm glad you changed your mind
Are you ready to talk about your brother?
His name is
was Uriel
And ever since he died,
I've been having this strange feeling
Something I've never felt before
Guilt
Why do you feel guilty?
Uriel didn't just die
I killed him
I've never
killed anyone before Only punished those already dead
You know, back when I used to run Hell
But
A stubborn Uriel he-he gave me no choice
He came down from the Silver City
to collect on the deal that I made with Dad
Intent on killing the detective or smiting Mum out of existence
- Lucifer - He brought Azrael's blade with him,
which is a a divine dagger that destroys your soul,
it doesn't just kill you
- It wipes you out - Lucifer, enough
I can't do this anymore
I can't keep track of all these elaborate metaphors
But it's not a metaphor,
Doctor
You need to take me seriously
You need to believe what I'm saying
Otherwise, you'll never understand
I'm a monster
A monster who deserves to be punished
I believe you feel that way
And I want to understand
I truly do!
But, Lucifer, you have to help me
I need you to be honest with me
Completely honest
about who you are
Completely honest?
- Are you sure? - Yes
Yes, I'm sure
That's what all of these sessions
Our entire relationship Is all about
Getting to know the real Lucifer
No more lies
No more metaphors
Very well
Yes
Doctor?
Uh

Previously on Lucifer
Seriously Tell me, what do you actually want?
My father was a cop He was a great cop
I really do want to help people
She starred in Hot Tub High School
And two weeks later, her father died
You were right before
We've been living in the past for too long
It's time we get a divorce
I need to figure out where I fit in in this world
So, we're still good to be roomies, right?
I need you to be honest with me about who you are
No more lies
Very well
Sloths move faster, Petey
Snails The humble tortoise
- You can't rush perfection - This is true
Hawaiian bread Just the way you like it
- Thanks, Petey - No, thank you, Officer Decker
Before I forget for you and Grace
- Hot Tub High School? - Opens Friday
My little monkey's gonna be a star
- We wouldn't miss it - Do me a favor
I hear there's some funny business about 15 minutes in
- Oh, you mean that scene where - Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's not finish that thought
Just tell her it was a good movie
- Kids these days - Yeah, I know
But, hey I'm proud of her
You okay, Petey?
Hey, listen
Hand over the cash
- Yes, don't shoot - Come on
- Here, here, here you go, don't shoot - Hurry up
Empty the whole thing Come on, let's go, let's go
No, Warden, you listen to me
This man killed my father
He cannot be released
Detective!
- I have a bone to pick with you - Not a good time, Lucifer
Agreed It's a horrible time
Dr Linda just canceled my session
She won't take my calls I think I truly scared her off
Something happened with your shrink?
Yes and it's all your fault
I mean, you're the one who suggested I open up to her
Well, smashing advice, Detective
I don't have time for this right now
What, do we have a case?
I'm dealing with my own issues
Oh! Even better
- Let's solve those, shall we? - Lucifer, stop!
I'm sorry, but there is no way that you can help me right now
You're just you're too you
Oh
Yes, you're right, Detective
Being me seems to be a problem, doesn't it?
Everywhere I go, someone gets hurt
Well, clearly, I need to be Not-Me instead
Someone better, more helpful
- More boring - Okay
got you a hot, soy latte, extra foam
Thank you
You okay, Chloe?
Mm-hmm All good
Just on my way out
Something's seriously bothering her
Hmm?
Oh, I hadn't noticed
But you did
This isn't right, Warden
Joe Fields is a convicted murderer, a cop killer
You're letting him off on family leave?
Detective, I understand how you feel
Oh, respectfully, there is no way you understand how I feel
I'm sorry
I know it's your father we're talking about, but this wasn't my call
Fields has been a model prisoner for over a decade
He lobbied the Prisoner's Rights Board and they said yes
What's he gonna do with his leave?
Go destroy another family?
It's for his granddaughter's christening
My dad never got to go to his granddaughter's christening
Where is the justice in that?
I'm sorry, Detective
I wish there was something we could do
- Uh Decker - Ah, Detective!
I think I may have found a way to make myself useful
What? It's not a good time, Lucifer
What if I told you I wasn't Lucifer anymore?
What?
I've decided to try and walk a mile in another man's shoes
See the world from a different perspective
I'm going to learn how to Douche
I may have to rephrase that one
But do I have your permission to follow Daniel and
Yeah, do whatever I got to go
Hello?
- I'll take that as a yes - Yeah, I'm just following up on
Uh, yeah
Joe Fields
Come out
You're not gonna get away with this
Joe Fields
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font> wwwaddic7edcom
I still don't get it, man
Why the hell are you following me around all of a sudden?
Because I want to learn what it's like to be you, Daniel
Your approach to life intrigues me
This from the guy who punched me in the face?
That was last week
Anyway, the detective already agreed to it
You're the department bottom, so you have to do as she says
What's this really about?
Look, people like you
They find you helpful, like duct tape or a trusty socket wrench
I want you to teach me your secret
I want you to show me how to be a tool
You should stay out of the way
Follow my lead I call all the shots, you understand?
This feels like something that you would agree to, so yes
What do we got?
Three gunshot victims, shot execution style
The van driver got a single bullet to the neck,
guard got one to the head
The prisoner got a double tap to the chest
Prisoner's name is Joe Fields
- Wait a minute, the Joe Fields? As in - Yeah
The guy that killed my father
They targeted him while he was vulnerable This was a hit, Dan
W-Wait a second
The guy who killed your dad was just murdered and you caught the case?
Yeah
That is totally messed up
- Mm-hmm - Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine - Fine?
You should be ecstatic
Your father's killer just got the ultimate punishment
- Who was first on the scene? - It was me
I made the call
- You followed him? - Yeah I know this looks bad
You stalked your father's murderer right before he was killed
That was a terrible move, Detective
It was, right?
What were you planning to do, Chloe?
Crash the christening?
I don't know, Dan! I was angry
The guy killed my father
He had the nerve to smile at me
Do you have any idea what that feels like?
No
No, I don't
But you still shouldn't have followed him
No one actually thinks that you did this,
- but you know what it looks like, right? - Yes, I do
That's why I'm gonna step away from the case
It's a massive conflict of interest
Don't worry, Chloe I'm gonna stay on this
Yes, Detective Dan and I won't rest until we catch the killer
I don't think that it's a good idea for Lucifer to be part of this case
I agree
I mean, the last thing this case needs is a loose canon
She needs someone like you A reliable, helpful, boring detective
Now, the good news is that's me as well now So, the Dans are on the case
Can't you take anything seriously, man?
I assure you I'm taking this very seriously
Oh, really? You're doing a great job of showing that
Guys
It would mean a lot to me if you worked together on this
Hmm
Of course, Chloe
Okay, so
whoa, this looks heavy
Like waiting-for-STD-results heavy
- I can come back later - Oh, no, it's fine What is it?
Okay, so, I went through all the prints from the van
Okay? And all of them cleared as prison personnel
except for an ex-con named Rodney Lam
And get this
he served time with Joe Fields
- We're on it - We're on it
Nice
You working on a new role?
Hmm?
You're wearing that to an interview?
What's the job?
Preschool aide
Do you like little kids?
I've dealt with filthy, screaming humans before
At least these are smaller
I'm not sure this is you
Ms Perez says we should choose jobs we love doing
So, what about you, Maze?
What do you love to do?
I don't know
Well just be yourself
Thanks, little human
So good
Well, the secret ingredient is the Hawaiian bread
And then you just cut a hole in the middle for the egg
Can we have this for every meal?
You know, this one used to be my favorite, too
Grandpa used to bring me this sandwich every Thursday after acting class
Why don't you ever talk about Grandpa?
Mm
I guess 'cause I miss him
Do you think he would've brought me sandwiches?
Mm-hmm
I think he would've loved that, monkey
Come on It's time for your homework
- Can I help you? - Chloe Decker?
You're gonna pay for what you've done
Okay, take it easy
My father was a good man
He didn't deserve to get gunned down like an animal
All he wanted was to meet my daughter
You're Tina Fields
You killed my father
- I didn't - Thought you were getting revenge,
but you murdered an innocent man
Tina, think about your baby
If you pull that trigger, you'll never hold her again
Mommy? Who's here?
It's nothing, honey Stay in your room!
I didn't kill your father
You have to believe me
Mommy, is everything okay?
Yeah, honey Everything's fine, monkey
Go back in your room
Mommy just needs to help another mommy
- Okay? - Oh, God, I'm sorry
I was just so angry
I never wanted to believe my dad killed a cop
And then today, when I got the video
What video?
His lawyers sent this to me
Said I was to receive it upon the event of his death
Ah Sorry, not sorry I had to stop for a costume change
- Nice jacket - Thank you
Oh, man, what the hell?
Are you here to work, or are you here to play games?
I'll have you know I take the School of Dan quite seriously,
even if it does involve skinny-fit jeans
Any news on our suspect?
His name is Rodney Lam
A CI told me that he's obsessed with this place He eats here all the time
So if he shows up,
let's try to see him before he sees us
Oh, I get it now
So your boring attire is like camo for the average Joe
Blend in, catch the baddie off guard
Afterwards they'll forget you're even there
That is very clever, Daniel
This guy has a serious history of violence
All right? He might have a gun
He might take a hostage Who knows what he could do?
So he wouldn't, say, be openly eating a nacho burrito dog, sitting on that car?
- You watch my six - Absolutely
Rodney Lam LAPD No sudden moves You're under arrest
Rodney?
Maybe we blend in so well he doesn't even see us
Rodney Lam!
Good call, Rodney
Nice and easy
Oh
I just wanted one last meal
You want a bite? Aah!
No, thank you, we're not doing carbs, are we?
Baby
it's Daddy
If, uh, you're watching this,
that means I'm dead
Now, I know it sucks
I don't know if you'll get this tomorrow
or, uh, 30 years from now,
but I want you to know the truth
I didn't kill that cop
I'm sorry for
missing all your birthdays and graduation your life
But Daddy wants you to know, baby
I love you
See? He's innocent
Tina, I can tell your dad loves you very much,
but this video doesn't prove anything
His lawyers had this tape for 16 years
He made them promise to give it to me when he died
That has to mean something
16 years
He recorded this the day my father was killed
Three minutes before he died What part of town is this?
It's our old apartment in Venice
My father was killed across the city in Korea town
There's no way your father could have recorded this
and gotten to the crime scene in time
So it's true He didn't do it
Which means whoever did kill my father
got away with this and is still out there
I did it
I killed Joe Fields
He disrespected me in the yard
So when I heard that he was getting some sort of temporary leave,
I knew that it was my chance to make things right
Well, there you have it
Looks like our douching paid off The detective will be pleased
And, you know, you make it look so easy
Where did you say you stopped that van again?
- Spring and College - We found it at Hill
That's what I meant
Then you went and you emptied the clip into the driver, right?
Hell yeah
The driver died from a single shot to the neck
Dan One, why are you spoiling a perfectly good confession?
You're lying, Rodney
You don't know the facts because you didn't do it
Oh, I see what you did there
Gosh, that's why you're Dan One
Why are you confessing to a crime you didn't commit?
Where are you going?
Well, just slow your roll for a second
I think, for the sake of the detective,
I'm gonna take a time-out from my Dansformation
Oh, God
Rodney, what do you want out of life, hmm?
To be a good provider and take care of my family
So you confess to a crime you didn't commit
That's quite counter-intuitive
Unless you got paid to do it
You've been locked up for most of your life
That's all you know
Now you're free, you've got mouths to feed,
No way to earn
Out here I'm no one, guys
And if we don't arrest you,
you don't get any money
But if he really wants back in the slammer,
then false confession's a criminal offense, correct?
- Definitely an obstruction of justice - Mm
Could get you a few years
We could get you a narcoleptic lawyer and a merciless judge
Who knows? With your prior history,
they might throw the book at you
- Hmm? - All right
Here's how it went down
I put word out that I needed money,
I was desperate
And some people came to me with an offer
Linda, you there?
I need a character reference
Linda?
Wha?
Can you teleport?
What? No
You left your window open
Hey, are you okay?
Wait
You know, don't you?
He showed you
I saw his face
Well, you're taking it really well, actually
Linda, you're not afraid of me, are you?
Of course I am
You're a demon
He told me
I thought it was a sexual metaphor
Well, you're not wrong there
But you really are one
Aren't you?
Yeah I am
Is that really so bad?
Please go
Ah, Detective
Joe Fields didn't kill my father
- Wait, what? - He's a fall guy
He made a false confession in exchange for regular payments to his daughter
All these years she didn't touch the money
She probably thought it was stolen
I have the account number that made the transfers
Well, we just met a chap who did the same thing
What?
Rodney got paid to make a false confession
Money was transferred into his wife's account right after we arrested him
This is the same account that paid Rodney Lam's wife
That's no coincidence
So whoever killed Joe Fields killed my father
and is still out there
Hey, don't blame yourself
- You were just a kid back then - Yeah, well, I'm not anymore
Hey, rookie!
You're late!
I thought I was early
Your FTO's been looking all over for you
What, you want to get written up your first day?
- No, I-I honestly thought - Knock it off, McMillan
Get back to work
You gotta watch out for this guy He gave me hell on my first day, too
- Hi - Hi
I'm Dan Espinoza
- Chloe Decker - Nice to meet you
Can I help you with those?
Sure
Come on, I'll show you around
The most important place, first, is the kitchen
We got bagels over here if you want them
Interrogation's that way
and the lab is that way
Are you John Decker's daughter?
I-I'm so sorry
He's kind of a legend around here
It was a little before my time, but he sounded like a great guy
The best
Um bagel?
Never fear, Luci-Dan is here
Or is it Douche-ifer? Actually, it's got more of a ring to it, hasn't it?
- Why are you two dressed the same? - Don't ask
The bank account traces back to a bathhouse on Pico
It's a dummy front for a Russian syndicate in LA
So the real killer is somehow connected to the Russian mob?
We have a suspect His name is Boris Sokolov Owns the bathhouse
Connects criminals but keeps his own hands clean
No one has ever been able to get to him
Yet
Detective Dan and I won't rest
until we get to the bottom of this, I promise you
Wow Look who bought a ticket to the gun show!
Divorce becomes you, Detective
I do not sound like that
Of course we do
We sound like two totally normal dudes
Will you cut it with the "we" stuff?
I need you to stop playing around and take this seriously
You got it, partner This is gonna be epic
Lucifer, I'm not kidding
Very well
So, what's the plan?
Well, you are exactly the kind of person that Boris would deal with,
so I need you to approach him, and try make a deal with him
All right Tell him I need a fall guy for a murder I'm gonna commit?
- Exactly - Hmm
But like I said before, he spooks really easily So, don't go
Boris!
Like that
Hello there
Uh, I'd like to talk with you, if I may
- I don't know you - You don't
So, let's fix that, shall we?
The name's Dan
- Deputy Warden's here for you - Oh
Joe Fields' personal effects
We usually turn those over to the next of kin within 72 hours, but, uh
I thought it might help you, Detective
Thank you
This is great Thank you
Well, if there's anything else I can do to help, please, let me know
Thanks
I know
Joe Fields isn't my case
I'll just I'll leave it for Dan
Well, I mean, nothing is stopping me
from helping out with the Joe Fields case,
while you tackle your dad's, right?
I mean, if it's the same killer divide and conquer
- You don't have to do that - I kind of already started
Uh, right over here Thanks
Last six months of your dad's paperwork
You know, incident reports, booking slips, arrest records
I mean, half of it's on microfiche and, like, papyrus,
but I don't know, I thought it would help, you know,
to figure out what your dad was working on when he was killed
See?
I knew you were a hugger
So What do you got so far?
It was a clever cover-up
But what kind of robber would be so well connected? You know?
They gave Joe Fields everything he needed
to pose as my father's killer
I mean, he confessed
And he had the gun that was used in the shooting
Ballistics confirmed that it was the murder weapon
Well, yeah No wonder it was case closed
Yeah I-I These prints are un-ID'd from the scene,
but they could be the killer's
And did they ping anyone in the database?
No Dead end
All right
Maybe I can dig a little deeper
So, tell me
Why would I help you two?
Because we're just two regular fellows who need your help, Boris
I don't believe you
- Mr Sokolov - People call me human lie detector
because I look in my clients' eyes,
and I can know if they're telling the truth
Well, I respect that, Boris
I have a trick myself, that's quite similar, actually
And you're right
We haven't told you the whole truth So here it goes
I want someone dead
Who?
Lucifer Morningstar
And what has this person done to deserve death?
Well, he hurts people
And not just his enemies,
those close to him, as well
In fact, I think he hurts them most of all
He's right
The guy's violent, he's a total loose cannon
Yes Believe me, when I say, Boris,
that the world would be a better place without him
You both have true hatred for this man
Apparently so
Do we have a deal?
Go and take care of this Lucifer person
I'll find you your patsy
Lovely
I hear you won't talk
Okay
We have hard evidence linking your bank account to two different murders
What do you have to say about that?
I heard you're a human lie detector, is that true?
One of those murders was my father
It's why I'm not on the case
and it's why I'm not supposed to be in this room talking to you
But I'm not a cop right now, Boris
I'm a daughter
And I'm not gonna let this go
So, you point me in the right direction
or I swear to God, I'm gonna make your life a living hell
I believe you
His name was John Decker
I admit to nothing
but I did once hear
about a John Decker
And as I recall,
he was sniffing somewhere he didn't belong
What do you mean? My father was a beat cop at a robbery gone wrong
Hey, man
I just want to say nice work earlier
Was it? Yeah
We got Boris
And I don't know how you lied to him like that
- Well, it's simple I didn't lie - Well
Well, then you have some serious issues, bro
Obviously I mean, why do you think I'm doing all this Dan-ing?
Yet, you know, I'm still no closer to figuring out your secret
- Because I don't have a secret - Well, you must
One that explains how you're able to be so
you know, frustratingly you
- You see, man - Hmm?
I try to compliment you, and
Hey
I think my father's death was a hit
I-It sounds like he stumbled onto something huge,
and-and someone took him out for it
Chloe, do you want me to help you with this?
No I-I I got it on this end But thank you
Well
Where to now, Twinsy? Hmm?
Wow
- What's the job this time? - Topless Maids
But apparently, I still have to do some cleaning
Screw that
- You okay? - No I just
I can't find the right job
My only friend stopped talking to me
"Only"?
What's all of this?
My dad's stuff from storage
After he died, the department boxed up his desk and sent it to us
You find anything?
Not yet
One of the cases he assisted on got him killed,
and I have to figure out which one it is, but
It's funny, he always talked about how he didn't want to be a detective,
how it was too much work, and yet
here he was doing all this detective work
Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
Hmm
I tried a bunch of stuff, but
after my dad died, this just felt right
Yeah, but like how do you know what feels right?
Mm
You just know
No secret, indeed
So, what's behind door number one, Daniel?
Oh, no, no Not this
Better a snuff movie, a human centipede,
clown porn, but not improv!
Hey, thanks for picking me up, man
What's your name?
Lucifer Morningstar
Wait, I'm hitchhiking with the Devil?
Oh, yes indeed
I didn't expect the Devil to be driving around LA
Oh, yes, I live here, actually
I do whatever I want
Oh, like what?
Drink, mostly And insult people
You ponce
- You got a girlfriend? Lovely - Yes
- Can I borrow her? - But she's the love of my life
Perfect
- Let's make it a threesome - That is not me!
- Relax, you'll get your turn - What's your problem, huh?
You gotta sign up, pal
Good scene, man You crushed it
You too, pal
Detective Douche!
How dare you subject me to this pathetic caricature?
You have the nerve to stand there and accuse me of making fun of you,
after everything you've done in the last couple days
Hell, ever since we first met
- Detective Douche, I - Dan! My name is Dan
Or Detective Espinoza
Right
Dan
I only did it because you're everything that I'm not
Boring, helpful
- Your life is simple - Oh
- My life? - Yes
Come on, man You're rich You're handsome
You drive fancy cars, you date hot girls
You have no kids, you have no responsibilities
How much more simple can life get?
Afraid you don't know the whole story
Well, fine Tell me
You see, that's just it, Dan
The last person I opened up to, I hurt
A lot
Let alone how I've hurt my own flesh and blood
It's all I seem to be able to do
Welcome to the club
You think Chloe divorced me because I'm a perfect guy?
I did a lot of things that I'm not proud of, man
And I'm just trying to work through them
What, through mime?
What do you do, stuff your feelings in a box and throw away the key?
It's not mime
It's improv
And I started the class after the divorce because I needed a distraction
Perspective
A way to step out of my own skin for a bit I don't know, I
I'm not a spontaneous guy
I don't live in the moment like you do
So, you were trying to learn how not to Douche
Yeah, I guess that's one way to put it
Don't tell Chloe
All right?
Oh
Oh, it's you Hello, Detective
- I got your message - Oh, hi
Feeling back to your old self?
I suppose So I doubt I'll be of much help
Ooh On second thoughts, it looks like I came at just the right time
I've have nothing to say to you
Thanks to you, I lost my friend
Friend? What friend?
The doctor
I was just working through some stuff
- I didn't think that showing - See, that's the problem
I wish for just one second
you would think about someone other than yourself
And there we have it, ladies
My wake of destruction
Anyone else you need harmed, hmm?
Okay, Lucifer? Enough
I'm close to something, I can feel it
Help
Fine
Actually, there is something that's been bugging me, Detective
Do you mind if I play the me's advocate for just a second?
Go ahead
Well, there's one part of this puzzle that just doesn't fit
Joe Fields
Wha why doesn't he fit?
Well, you said that he smiled at you when he was released
Yeah, I forgot about that
So, why would an innocent man smile at the daughter of a man
he took the fall for killing?
He wouldn't
What are you looking for?
The prints that Ella found on Fields' transport van
But those only gave us Rodney Lam
But there were other prints
But they cleared as prison personnel
Like Deputy Warden Perry Smith
- These are his prints - What, you think the warden did it?
Well, deputy wardens are desk jockeys, bureaucrats
So his prints shouldn't have been there
Yes What if Fields wasn't smiling at me?
What if he was smiling at the person next to me? The warden?
So you think that Joe Fields and the warden had some kind of deal?
- Yes - What, Fields serves 16 years
as a fall guy and then suddenly has a change of heart?
Well, he had a grandkid Maybe he got sick of the deal,
told the warden he wanted out?
And the warden said yes, but only as a ploy to kill Fields
Right
Deputy Warden Perry Smith
worked in the prison system for 20 years
Started as a guard He's our guy
Let's go
Right, well, wouldn't Dan be more helpful?
What?
If I'm gonna take this guy down,
I need my partner
and that's you Lucifer Morningstar
Right
Good-bye!
I guess I'll just clean up
I'm dressed for it, apparently
It looks like the cavalry's arrived
- Dan, what's happening? - I'm so sorry, Chloe
- The warden gave us the slip - What?
Are you okay, Detective?
This whole time, my father's killer's been out there
And today I let him get away
So, no, I feel like a failure
What you are nothing of the sort
Detective,
for the first time in 16 years, you know who the real killer is
It seems to me that justice is in your sights
You're right
I put out a BOLO
FBI and DHS are looking at airports, border crossings
Well, I've still no idea what that means, but it sounds good
It means I'm gonna get the son of a bitch
Right Well
in the meantime, since your offspring's with Dan
What?
I'm simply suggesting that you open a bottle of wine, or three,
for yourself, and just have a nice
Shut up!
Well
Bravo, Maze
- How did you get - I was bored
Had nothing to do
So, I tracked down the scumbag myself
It just felt right
It's gonna feel good to call this in
What? No, hold on, Detective
- You have a choice to make here - Yes
So much punishment
Mm Order off-menu for once
Maze and I certainly won't judge
You took my father away
You tore apart my family
I tried to get him to drop it
But he wouldn't take the hint
That's all you have to say?
After everything you've done?
No, no, no No, no, no I-I'm sorry
I'll give you all the players in my operation
I'll give you money
Oh
We'll see how you do in the prison that you ran
I'll bet your inmates will treat you real nice
No No, please, please
I can get you whatever you want
All I want is for you to know that John Decker's kid got you
Linda
I know you're in there
I have something to show you
My first check
I got paid
As a bounty hunter!
LAPD paid me this finder's fee to track down some human scumbag
Hunting humans is a job
Who knew?
First thing I wanted to do was to celebrate with my friend
That's you, Linda
Okay
I just
wanted you to know
Maze, how can we be friends?
You're a
you're a demon
Lucifer's the Devil
How am I supposed to get over that?
He's still the same old Lucifer
You're still Dr Linda Martin
And I'm still Maze
What's changed?
Come on
Let Mazikeen Smith buy you a drink
Maybe I'll devour your soul or something
- Here you go, monkey - Mmm Yummy
- Lucif - Mmm
Why should the child go first?
I'm far larger And hungrier
It's okay, Mommy
He must've really wanted it
Is she always so her?
Baby, it's time to get dressed
What are you doing?
- Bye, Lucifer! - Yes
Yes
I don't care much for my dad
But you clearly care about yours
Which is why you followed in his footsteps, I suppose
Hmm
So, w-what I'm trying to say is
I think he would be proud of you
Oh My apologies, Detective I didn't mean to hurt you
No, no, it's
Wh Then why are you crying?
- Just Oh, just shut up - What
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font> wwwaddic7edcom

- Previously on Lucifer - I don't care much for my dad
But you clearly care about yours
I think he would be proud of you
Uriel, that's Azrael's blade
You're not planning on taking Mum back to Hell
That weapon will wipe her out of existence entirely
No Heaven, no Hell, just
gone
Why do you feel guilty?
Uriel didn't just die
I killed him
I need you to be honest with me
about who you are
No more lies
Very well
This is where Lucifer buried your brother
Why did he do this?
- Lucifer was just trying - No, Mom
Not Lucifer Father
If he wanted to, he could have
prevented all of this from happening
I'm done trying to please someone who isn't even here
What the hell?!
Aah! Get off me!
Help!
Help!
Stop! Stop!
- Leave her alone! - Hey, man, stop!
Wait It's you?
You're kidding me, right?
We can totally work this out
And so there we were, the detective and I,
standing in her kitchen, and
she made me
a sandwich
I believe this is the part where you tell me
it's much more than just a sandwich
For example
maybe it was a gesture of intimacy
You know, the slices of bread representing, perhaps,
the detective's trust
Or was it a mistrustful sandwich?
I
Doctor, please,
what delicious message was she sending me?
What about Hitler?
The sandwich is Hitler?
How did you actually torture Hitler in Hell?
I mean, is his cell next to Idi Amin's?
Or Mussolini's?
Or is there kind of a-a-a
a tyrant wing in Hell?
Right
I suppose it was futile of me to think that you wouldn't want
to discuss the whole "I'm really the Devil" thing
The actual Devil?
Look, I have to say
I was worried I'd never see you again
I thought I'd
- scared you off for good - Yes,
well, Maze, of all people
well, of all
demons
gave me some needed clarity
Did she, now?
Yes Right Well,
speaking of clarity, do you mind if we return
to my current emotional growth?
Oh Yes
Sorry
Apology accepted
So, um
what do you think it means?
What about my Uncle Edwin?
Is he down there? I mean, 'cause he was
you know
one he was one bad mama jama
I think I've broken my therapist
And now she's somewhere to the left of totally useless
and to the right of babbling lunatic
Oh, so she's you in a skirt
Very funny This is serious, Detective
I'm actually a bit worried for her
Hmm, I'm sure she'll be fine,
but if you need anyone to talk to, I'm here
This is actually something I can't discuss with you
What? I'm sure I can handle it
I've seen all your ugly parts by now
Not even close, I'm afraid
Saved by the Douche
Our victim's name is Maddie Howard
She was attacked when she left her apartment
The assailant chased her down the alley
and stabbed her repeatedly
19 times, to be exact
Overkill is usually a crime of passion they probably
knew each other
She was killed in broad daylight?
- There must have been witnesses - Yeah,
a bunch, but depending on who you ask,
the killer was a male who's either Hispanic,
Caucasian or black, short or tall, brown or blond hair,
or completely bald
So we're dealing with a shapeshifter
Well, eyewitness testimonies can be unreliable
Yeah, people's ojos go a little loco
Evidence, however, does not lie
We got substantial bruising to the skin,
blade penetrated not only soft tissue but also bone
So the killer was big and strong
Also, blond head hair, so odds are really good
- we're looking for a white guy - Hey, guys
Got something over here Tourist caught the beginning moments
of the attack in the background of a photo
Did you get a look at the killer?
No, but look at this we got a good look at the weapon
Pretty insane Looks like a movie prop or something
Can't be
What do you mean, "Can't be"?
A movie prop Those things are rubber, aren't they?
What?
I have to go
I don't really have time for a hike, Lucifer
Bounty business is booming, okay?
So this better be important
It is
Is this?
Where Lucifer buried Uriel Yeah
Okay
So if you two want to cry it out, I'll be in the car
What's happened, Lucifer?
- Well, someone dug up the grave - Yeah,
I can see that
But why?
- Uriel's body is still there - Yes,
but Azrael's blade isn't
I believe the weapon of the Angel of Death
is in human hands
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
So let me get this straight: in human hands, Azrael's blade
wants to kill?
It demands to be used to
- to fulfill its purpose - Humans are more
malleable than we are, so it whispers in their ears,
beckons to be held it takes any reason someone might want
- to hurt another and - Amplifies it
- a thousandfold - So if someone
leaves the toilet seat up
Trip to stabby town, yes
That's one angry-ass knife
Yes, well,
it was stolen from the Angel of Death
Sis is no sweet peach, is she?
Listen, we're wasting time here
We need to find the blade
Why?
So a few meter maids bite the dust, who cares?
People off each other all the time
No, Maze, you don't understand
This will accelerate
Passing from human to human, leaving an unimaginable trail
of destruction in its wake
Yes, nasty little thing
We need to retrieve it
Oh, I'm so glad you're on board with this, Luci
I mean, who would've thought that bringing celestial objects
to Earth might lead to such destruction?
Ooh, I like the smug
Much sexier than the earnest
I'm just surprised that you would actually take
a little bit of responsibility
I thought an unmarked grave in the middle of nowhere
would be safe enough
Clearly I was wrong
But I clean up my messes
Well, good luck, you two
You'll want to help, Maze
No, thanks
Let me remind you, I have a job
And let me remind you that the blade doesn't just kill humans
It also obliterates celestial beings,
including demons
So, say the detective were to find it and bring it home
I get snuffed out for not doing the dishes
Which is why the detective can't be part of this investigation
Now, I'll need you two to move Uriel's body
Somewhere it won't be found this time
Very well
And one note,
you're to do so without disturbing the grave site
in the slightest, specifically that footprint there
Why?
Because I'm going to get an expert to help me examine it
You need a favor?
Yes, your scientific expertise on a discreet matter
Mm
Paternity test?
What? Do I look like someone who'd be so irresponsible?
Uh, regardless, if you do this favor for me,
then I'll do a favor for you in return
Lucifer,
the whole point of a favor is to do it for free, okay?
And then you just trust the love will come back to you somehow
Favors are about faith
Ugh Please don't ruin favors for me
Look, come on, I insist
Tit for tat
Fine, um
Well, there is something that I would like
Mm?
But I'm not sure you can handle it
Oh, well, now I'm intrigued
I mean, it might be a little
inappropriate among colleagues
Oh, right, even better
Well, why don't you, uh
Well Okay, so
Oh
Oh, no, no
Definitely not
You're the one who wanted tit for tat
Yes, if only it were that simple
All right, fine
You have a deal
Gosh, you're a nasty little nerd, aren't you?
Right Here we are
Does your favor involve killing me?
I'm just kidding, no
I need you to do your forensic whatnots
and work out what disturbed this area
Uh, you mean this empty grave?
Look,
you said to me that favors were about faith, right?
Yeah
Well, I'm asking you to have faith in me
And know that I wouldn't ask anything untoward of you
You know, when you use my own words against me like that,
it's actually really hard to say no
I know
There's some very interesting footprints over there
Well, it looks like we got a man's sneaker
Okay, I'll take a mold, but assuming
it's one of the major brands, I mean, you're looking at a pool
of, like, two million dudes in LA
Maybe 10,000 robust ladies
Well, I was hoping for something a little more specific
Thai's not how analytical science works
Whoa
Someone tried to burn something
It looks like there's writing on one s
side
Yeah, I should be able to reconstruct this at the lab
Ah, excellent
Right, whilst you do that, I'll get back to the detective
Oh, and remember
Yeah, don't tell anyone
about your super creepy non-grave grave
Got it
So you worked here with the deceased?
We didn't just work together
I mean, Maddie was a friend
The person who introduced me to the Glory Way
God, I can't believe that she's dead
I'm sorry The glory what?
The glory hole
The Glory Way
- Ah - Developed by
our guru, Jenson Glory
The Glory Way is a mind and body sensibility system
designed to reveal what we call
the "home you"
Right Do people actually believe
the word salad that you're selling?
'Cause, I mean, look,
I enjoy a taut, spandex-wrapped backside
as much as the next chap,
but that was one large helping of spiritual gobbledy-gook
Follow Jenson's teachings and you will uncover your true self
And what if your true self is a 400-pound nimrod with flatulence issues?
Just saying Some things are better left buried
Given the specifics of the murder,
we're looking for someone who had a real hatred for Maddie
Does anyone come to mind?
No Maddie was a wholesome soul, a true light
What about petty grievances?
Perhaps Maddie drank someone's probiotic smoothie
or did one too many peacock poses for someone's taste?
- Lucifer - No
Just think
There must be some little disagreements
So why don't you write us up a list?
Anyone who so much as raised a patchouli-scented eyebrow
in Maddie's direction could be the killer
- See - Excuse us
That's not the profile
of the murderer we're investigating
I'm just being thorough, Detective
Like you said, "Shake the bushes until the truth flies free"
I don't think I've ever said that before
- No? - Uh-uh
Oh Perhaps it was Ms Lopez
Mm You've been spending a lot of time with Ella
You know, working together, I mean
Not particularly
Hmm
Shall we see how this list is getting on?
Mm-hmm
Glad to see you're hard at work
You know, studies show that the brain does some of its best work
when it's not trying
That's why great ideas come in the shower
- For me, it's usually women - Hmm
Any progress so far?
- Damn straight - Hmm
I
rehydrated that burnt piece of paper
we found at your super creepy place
using polyvinyl acetate
- Oh, it's easy for you to say - I ran these pieces
through a pattern recognition program,
and I found two things
First
what looks to be a map
leading from downtown LA to that exact spot you took me to
Right What was the second thing?
Some business logo of a law firm
What law firm?
Bloody hell
I said no interruptions, so unless
you're that broad-shouldered intern from this morning
Hello, Mum
Oh
Hello, son
It appears you've been busy
I was getting bored with my mate and offspring,
so I thought I'd dive into my employment
Not that hard once you read the law books
What law books?
Well, all of them
Took less than a weekend
with time to teach the hubby
new tricks
Have you ever heard of something called the reverse cowgirl?
Well, I'm thrilled,
Mum, really, I am
Here you are studying law and the Kama Sutra
And drawing maps to Uriel's grave!
Did someone find the blade?
Oh, so you admit that you led a human to it?
Well, not a human More like ten
- Ten? - Maybe 12 Uh
- But - 15?
Only my craftiest clients
I mean, I had to make sure that someone would actually
follow through and dig the damn thing up
Why in the world would you tell people?
What is wrong with you?!
Me? If you didn't want the blade found,
you shouldn't have left it in a hole in the ground!
A filled-in hole in the middle of nowhere,
which no one would've possibly found if not for you
Yes Well there's that
Besides, where else am I gonna hide it?
Lux? You know how many people traipse through there each week?
Well, I don't know Your bedroom, then
- Worse - Yes
You are sexually prolific
Turns out, you get that from me
Oh, Mum, why?
Why would you release Azrael's blade into the world?
Because I wanted to get your father's attention
Your brother,
Uriel my son died
Do you think it's crazy that I wanted to talk about it?
Mourn with him, maybe?!
- I - So I reached out,
and guess what I got back
- Nothing - Yes
Like always
So I figured that if his toys started stabbing each other
with a celestial blade, that maybe he might take a moment
Humans are dying because of you
Well, humans die
They all do eventually
It's what they were designed to do
Yes, but not like this
Your vacation here has changed you
You seem attached to these creatures,
and I can't, for the life of me, figure out why
Look, you say you want to stay here on Earth,
to live with your sons, right?
So, a choice: willingly help me get the blade back,
or I'll send Maze over here to give you some inspiration
Hmm Fine
You're killing my reverse cowgirl high
I
LAPD
investigation, that's right
Uh, just your whereabouts around 7:00 am this morning
Okay Can you prove that?
Right
Thank you
So the guy that complained
Maddie didn't have enough cool-down time was
at an ashram in Sedona, so, not our guy
My pudding's gone
I'm sorry?
In the break room fridge, my pudding
Clearly labeled "Dan" It's gone
Not the first time, either
Wow Do you want me to put some unis on it?
Want me to schedule a stakeout?
- Are you even okay? - No, Chloe
I'm just saying that a man's snacks they're sacred, okay?
- Okay - What up, detective people?
- Hey - Hey
Are Lucifer and Ella working on a case that I don't know about?
Mm Why?
No reason, they just seem to be spending a lot of time together
Is someone jealous?
What?
No
No way
- Gross - 'Cause you can tell me if you are
I mean
we can be there for each other, as friends
Even even if it's about another guy
Right, but Lucifer's not another guy
He's a weirdo
This is about partnership, nothing more
Partners don't keep secrets
Well, maybe with Ella,
it's more than just sex, maybe it's
a little more serious
Huh?
No, it's not like Lucifer I don't think he
"Not like Lucifer" wha-what?
Likes poker
Dan has a monthly game
Oh, no, I love a good gamble
Count me in
Right, where's that list of grievances
against poor Maddie?
- Oh, it's the - Yeah
- There all right, there you go - Lovely, thank you
Why would you do that?
Okay, now you're making it weird You're making it weird
- You're making it weirder - Sorry
I'll make it weird on your face
Duncan Watts is our killer
What makes you say that?
Well, just a hunch
Duncan Watts
His offices are upstairs above the yoga studio
Oh, and he's Maddie and Corrina's landlord
Duncan was apparently upset that Maddie kept parking in his spot
He also tried
to have the yoga studio evicted a few months ago
Neither of which is really a reason for 19 stabs
Yes, but just look at his stabby mug, hmm?
Blond hair, thick neck, which suggests Cro-Magnon strength
Just as our dear Ella guesstimated
Ah, "dear Ella," hmm
Where you going?
I'm just off to see this Duncan chap
No
We will go together like partners, okay?
Right, yes, I-I just need to make a quick phone call first
Oh, okay No worries
Private phone call, Detective
Just give me a moment
Yeah, sure
You sure this is the right place?
Duncan Watts, Maze
That's the name Lucifer gave me
I got nothing
Yeah, me neither
Even if we find the blade, it's a temporary fix
Your mom is the problem
She released the blade to create chaos,
and you two respond by coddling her
Nobody's coddling her, all right?
Tell yourself whatever you want,
but you know it's true, and it explains a lot
Explains what?
Doesn't really matter anymore,
but, just so you know, this whole mama's boy thing?
Kind of a turnoff
Oh, yeah?
Well, your whole "skintight leather,
hot body everywhere" thing?
- Mm-hmm? - It's really not that
It's not it's not that-that great
Yeah, it is
They're here
Yeah, we should probably warn Lucifer
Well? There's no blade
Right, use the back way out
Ah, Detective,
you know, after reflection, I think you're right
Parking space thievery is no motive for murder
What is going on with you?
First, you're so eager to get here,
you practically jump out of my car before I've parked,
and now you want to leave
What are you hiding?
Hiding? What would I be hiding?
Blood
What?
This is Unit 831 requesting backup
Soul Depot, 15534 Hillgreen Drive
It's Duncan
Oh, must've been some parking space
Uh, Detective
Yeah
Seems this class took corpse pose quite literally
So, no sign of the murder weapon?
Uh-uh
Are you sure?
Right Nothing left for us to do here then, I suppose
Except for figuring out how six people were killed
I'm thinking the primary killer was Duncan
Killing Maddie didn't satiate his anger,
so he went after her clients and probably got stabbed
when one of them defended themselves
I doubt it More likely the weapon was passed
from one person to the next
in a game of murderous hot potato
That's insane
I know, right?
Totally insane and probably exactly what happened
I say this with huge respect for the dead,
but this case is totally gonna be a panel
at the next forensic conference
Okay So based on my preliminary
assessment of the wounds,
it looks like Duncan came through the door,
attacked victim number two with the same weapon
used to kill Maddie Howard
But Duncan had ligature marks on his neck,
like someone strangled him
from behind with a yoga strap
Like this, here
- Oh - Right?
Which is when he attacked
victim number three
But victim number three had defensive wounds
that matched skin flecks
under the fingernails of number four,
so I'm thinking Duncan
dropped the knife
Okay, number four picked it up, right?
Attacked number three, like this
Right, and then at some point,
number five got involved
And so on and so on, until full yoga massacre
Oh, that will be what the panel's called,
Full Yoga Massacre
- 2016 - Very good
Okay, so, say that all happened like you just said it did,
which is crazy
There are seven mats and seven bodies
Yeah So?
So Duncan was the pissed off landlord,
not the class attendee
Subtract him, we're missing one yogi
Okay, well, all of the bodies were situated
around these six mats The student mats
So that could be the teacher's mat, maybe
The teacher must have been here
Get this
Teacher training taught by
Jenson Glory himself
I mean,
his body's not among the dead
Could be our missing victim
Slash attacker
Guy's a piece of work
Jenson Glory, his real name is Jamie Ostrowski
Soul Depot is the latest in a long line of
failed fitness enterprises
Glory has five fraud lawsuits,
two sexual harassment claims working their way
through the court system
Sexual harassment?
Yeah, former assistants
Both beautiful young women,
like Maddie
Oh, and look at the contract that they sign
when students join Soul Depot
"I surrender myself to Soul Depot,
body, mind and soul,
and to the only true guru of health and serenity,
Jenson Glory" Wow
Pretty much a cult
Think he brainwashed his students
into a Jonestown type thing?
Kind of a stretch, right?
That a yoga pun?
No It's an honest question
I mean, drinking cyanide juice is one thing,
but a bunch of people stabbing each other?
Totally insane!
A magic blade in Los Angeles
which belongs to the Angel of Death?
Now, in the hands of a yogi shyster
who's apparently touchy-feely in more ways than one
Okay, can we go back
to the Angel of Death?
Is he uh,
is he another one of your brothers?
Sister, actually
The Angel of Death is a chick?
Yes, I sort of wish we were
back to talking in metaphors
- That makes two of us - Because I do actually
have things that I'd like to talk about, Doctor
Oh Oh, yes I'm so sorry
Yes Please
Right
So, my mum asked me why I care so much
about these people dying
and I'm not sure I know
I mean, it's not like I know them personally,
and Maze is right
Even without Azrael's blade, humans are capricious
Hell,
they're willing to trade their souls
to lose unsightly tummy fat, but
So
why should I feel bad?
Why should I feel responsible?
And why
am I doing my own therapy?
Lucifer, I'm sorry
I'm trying to digest this whole thing
myself And, well,
there is no listing in the DSM-5 for Azrael's Blade Anxiety
Oh
Excuse me
_
Ah,
the guru with the doo-doo juju has been picked up
So, I'm afraid that's all we've got time for today
Just call me if you need to reschedule
I wasn't even at the studio, actually
That's not what the schedule says
May I have a tea?
Siberian ginseng if you have it
Well
Hello, Richard Simmons
Sorry I'm late
Where's the knife?
Who is this tense man?
Okay,
back to the teacher training class
Can you prove that you weren't there?
Of course, there's a computer system
All of the teachers have to swipe a key card
Even me Check it
So, where were you?
Home
I missed the last few classes, actually
I've been sick
Obsessing over a new toy, more like
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about something that's probably beckoning you
as we speak
Whispering to you
to do terrible things
Wretched, sinful deeds
That that's true
I-I want
Go on, tell me Tell me what you want,
what you really, really want
I want
a raspberry cream cheese muffin
And and-and
to take this thing
off!
- Oh, my - Oh
Expecting twins, are we?
Hey, I backslid a little bit, all right?
Carbs are the Devil's spawn, man
Don't blame your weaknesses on me
- Huh? - Is that why you didn't show up
to the class? Because you gained weight?
Of course No one's gonna find their "home self"
from a guru who looks like he ate all the furniture
Well, I think I'd rather be chubby
than a handsy dipstick in a corset
That's it
I want my lawyer now
Well, don't eat him
All right, listen, we searched Glory's house,
his car, his other car
there is no blade
We did find a safe in the basement
Pop-Tarts
Which you stole?
Ah, I figured it's a win-win
I'm saving the evil guru from future fat,
and, you know,
Pop-Tarts
Mr Glory has a second home in Ventura
If you wouldn't mind
Okay, we'll check it out,
but
Luci, if he's the one with the blade,
he's much more likely to go on a killing spree
than to stash it
Ah Come back for your processed pastries?
Ms Lopez!
Well, this is a surprise
Have you found something new?
Oh, I found something all right
Proof of Bigfoot?
Tread on the shoes Duncan Watts was wearing
when he was found dead
Tread that you showed me
at your super weirdo hole in the ground
They match, which means that this case
and your favor
are connected
Start talkin', dude
Do you have something to do with these murders?
Come clean with me
Or I can't keep this a secret anymore
You see, that's just it
The last person I came clean with
became a tad untethered
Dude, I grew up in Detroit
Look,
all I can tell you is
I'm dealing with a matter of cosmic importance
and I ask you to indulge me for just a little longer
You mean have faith?
Tomato, tomahto
Well, I guess faith isn't faith
unless it's tested
Bring it in
What? Oh
- Ella - Detective
Oh, um
I was just
uh, you see,
there's this, uh, store that has really special
soap
And, you know,
but I should really get going now and
clean stuff with the soap
- Bye! - Enjoy your shower
So, um
to what do I owe this pleasure?
Jenson's home security system shows video of him sleeping
during the murders, so he wasn't lying about that
We checked the key card system at Soul Depot,
and guess who was subbing for Jenson
Corrina,
Maddie's co-manager
Right, and where's Corrina now?
We checked her house, she wasn't there
Forensics confirms that she didn't kill anyone at Soul Depot,
so she's either running, hiding or scared
I put out a BOLO
Yeah, I don't think Corrina's the one running this time
What?
Where are you going?
Hello?
Hello?
Anyone here yielding a deadly, celestial blade?
Huh? Anyone?
Well, that'll be a resounding yes
I I don't know what happened
I was in class and Duncan barged in
It was horrible
All that killing
and the knife was on the ground
It started calling you
Did I do that?
Yes
You got retribution for a grudge, I believe
But it wasn't an insignificant grudge, was it?
Did he harass you like the others?
Or was it worse than that?
Years ago
We were alone in the studio
I-I I said no
I swear, but he wouldn't stop
I-I I tried to forget I
You tried to bury it deep, get on with your life
You might have succeeded,
if not for
the blade
LAPD, hands in the air
Move away from the body, Corinna
- Now! - I I-I killed him
I-I did this I
Acted in self-defense
Mr Glory attacked Corrina first She had no choice
but to wield that knife, Detective
I think, in this case, justice has actually been served
Henderson, take her statement
Come with me
Where's the murder weapon?
What?
Unis shouldn't have bagged it without taking photos
They couldn't help themselves
Anyone else feeling a murderous urge?
No? The need to slice and dice?
Anyone?
Oh, God
Oh, no
Detective Douche Daniel Dan
Why don't you put down the knife, hmm?
Bury the proverbial hatchet and all that?
I mean, I know we've had our differences in the past, but
we're friends now, right?
You ruined my marriage
I'll take that as a no
My life went to hell when I met you!
Hey! Well, technically, that's not true, but I understand
the basic metaphor
Easy with the blade, Detective
One deep cut, and yours truly could be wiped from existence
Prayers answered
What
Okay, Detective,
I can assure you your current mood will be rectified
by simply putting down the knife
My entire life imploded because of you
- What? - My marriage!
My job
My snacks
- What? - I know you ate my pudding
You're really going to smite me
over a tub of sweetened goo?
You're damn right I am
Dan Dan
Recent friend Growing compatriot
Your marriage was already on the rocks
You started cutting procedural corners way before I arrived,
and as for your pudding
As for your pudding, I
Okay, yes
I sometimes lay waste to the precinct fridge
But have mercy, Daniel
How was I supposed to know it was yours?
Because it was labeled!
You're fighting the blade, which indicates a strength
I didn't know you had Look at me in the eye
Look at me
Your marriage
Did I ruin it?
No
No
We were separated before Chloe even met you
And your career?
Palmetto was all me
Yeah Yeah
W-What are we doing back here?
Hmm? Oh, just a nice,
intimate chat between friends
I'm glad you got it off your chest
Oh, man, you're bleeding
What? Oh
No, it's just a scratch, really
Nothing to worry about And you?
How are you doing?
I feel great, actually
Good
Good talk
Ah! Good morning, Detective
Everything all right?
No Heads are gonna roll
First, some tech pulled the murder weapon
without documentation, and now it's just gone
Right Well, it's probably for the best
Nasty bit of steel, anyway
So, one second you're obsessed
with the knife, and now it's just no big deal?
Well, we got the murderer, didn't we? Job done
You know, Lucifer
I thought you and I had a real moment the other day,
talking about my dad, I
I thought we were partners,
but more importantly, friends
Right
Is this about me and Ella in the penthouse?
Look, who you sleep with is none of my business,
but
I mean, the lab tech? Really?
- It's a little inappropriate - Well,
much as I love to cross professional boundaries,
Detective, I can assure you, everything you saw
was entirely work-related
Mm-hmm? Is that is that the truth?
Always the truth
Point of pride for me, Detective
- Gotcha - But you know,
if you ever did want to cross boundaries
into "partnered friends who hang out naked"
Okay Stop talking
So, global crisis averted?
Yes For now
So, we can
you know, talk about Caligula, Stalin,
Trump I mean,
I know he's not dead, but he's definitely going
Lucifer, I owe you an apology
But in my defense
you're the Devil
Things were much less complicated when I thought
you were just another average delusional patient
with a complicated family
Well, I've never been "average," Linda
Mentally, physically And as you know
Sexually
Oh, my God
I had sex with the Devil
Many, many times And you're welcome
Okay, now, see, that I understand
Narcissistic tendencies rooted
in a complex paternal relationship
and a disrupted adolescence
See? Just another screwed up patient
And you can treat me as such
All right
Let's do this
The doctor is in
Lovely
I really do have urgent business
to attend to Are you certain
that this is the favor that you desire?
Because, uh, believe me, when I say the last two times
I've darkened the doorstep of a church,
- insert blood-soaked carnage here - Again,
with the drama!
We solved your case, now I get my favor
Just go with me, okay?
Look, since the moment we've met,
okay, I've had this Spidey-sense that you were
I don't know, searching for something
- Right Spiritual lost and found - Yes!
And I have found a lot since I developed a relationship
with the Big Guy, and so might you
Trust me We're much closer than you think
Well, then, no harm, no foul
I beg to differ
Oh
On second thought
What?
I should at least give someone a reason to go to confession
So, where will you put it, brother?
Somewhere far away from our mum,
for starters
Mm!
And speak of the Devil's mum
Well, that was fast
You couldn't have waited a day or two to find it?
There hasn't been nearly enough carnage
Now we'll never hear from your father
All the killing in the world
may not have gotten his attention, Mum
Surely you've learned that by now
Uriel was our son
Your brother
We should grieve together
I don't think that's all this is about
You want something from Him
What is it?
What I've always wanted
I want my family back
I'm afraid that's not possible
Oh, but it is
With my two sons by my side, a united front,
your father will be forced to listen to reason
Force Dad?
I think human delusion is rubbing off on you, Mother
Tell her
Luci, I can't, because I agree with her
I thought you were just Team Mum
because you couldn't fly her back to Hell
- Since when did you turn? - Now,
more than ever, I know that humanity and divinity
do not mix
That that blade, Luci
That blade was the last straw It shouldn't be here
We shouldn't be here
Well,
- I am not going back to Hell - Oh, this isn't about
returning to Hell
This is about Heaven
It's about going home
Home
For you, maybe
Neither of you understand, do you?
You never have
Hell wasn't home, and Heaven was
well hell!
The only place I've ever felt
wanted or respected
Is here? With humanity?
Yes This is my home
Deal with it, Mother
Fine
Fine
No sense arguing
Time to go
Careful
It's sharp
What's that saying?
"When my dear husband closes a door,
he opens a window"?
The window just opened

Previously on Lucifer
I was worried I'd never see you again
I've had patients who revealed a new side
of themselves, but not so much
the actual devil
- We're good, right? - Yeah Really good
We could be there for each other as friends
even if it's about another guy
What is she doing here?
Charlotte Richards, the defense attorney
Thought I'd dive into my employment
Humans are dying because of you
I'm stronger than you'd think
You seem attached to these creatures,
and I can't figure out why
We shouldn't be here!
The only place I've ever felt wanted or respected
Is here with humanity?
This is my home!
Deal with it, Mother!
Sunshine Beautiful people
Expensive cars
The glamorous life Get ready to see the real
Los Angeles on this thrill
ride tour
Well, it appears I've been misled
Whoever put together this brochure
should get special treatment in Hell
I don't need you to show me around the city
Well, of course you do
This is an exciting time, brother!
Now that we're making Los Angeles our home,
the City of Angels can finally earn its name
You are making it a home
Mom and I are gonna find a way to get back to the Silver City
- One way or another - But why?
When Los Angeles has so much to offer?
On your right,
you'll see the famous shop,
Pooch Pouch, the store that sells purses
for purse-sized dogs
Clearly
- Don't get it confused with the store - Excuse me Sorry
that sells dogs in the shapes of purses
Sorry, I do apologize
- That's on your left - Pardon me, excuse me
Yeah, thank you
Please That's your corner
Ah Right Forget everything
you just slept through
Welcome to Los Angeles,
city of reinvention, where you can become
whomever you want
Uh, if we look over here
That humungous house in the distance, the owner,
he moved out here with just ten dollars and a dream
Within three years, he was running
the largest underground sex club in the country
Los Angeles is also a place where you can do
whatever you want To your right hand side over here,
this folically challenged man That's Sleepy Pete Hello, Pete
Give us a wave
Everyone wave at Pete
He will sell you the best Molly in the city
Don't buy his cocaine, though
It's got enough baking soda in it to make a cake
It's not a bad idea, as I think about it
To your right again My nightclub, Lux!
The city's crowning achievement
My brother and I are celebrating
I don't understand him
Why won't Amenadiel embrace this city like I have?
Well, people often need time to adjust to change
And he's only been here for a few months
And if what you say is true
What? That he's got a stick so far up his ass
you can see it when he yawns?
That he's a fallen angel
Oh, yes, that, too
Then this could be about more than finding a home for him
But we're here to talk about you
Why did you recently decide that this was your home?
Well, I said it when I was in a row with my mum
I didn't realize how true it was until I yelled it in her face
Yes, your mother,
who is a literal goddess of all creation
Still haven't quite wrapped my brain around that one
Yes, well, anyway, her and Amenadiel want
to get back to the Silver City, but it's not my home
It never was
And neither was Hell
No No, that was somewhere
I was sent as a punishment
Like the DMV, but less screaming
So would you say that this is your first home?
Yes, I suppose it is
And why do you think that's the case?
Well, I don't know, Doctor You tell me
I find that people
make Los Angeles their home for one of two reasons
Either they're running from something,
or looking for something
Oh, and which one are you?
I'm not the one on the couch, Lucifer
So ask yourself
Which is it?
Running or looking?
Lucifer? Lucifer?!
Get out of the chair
Oh, come on, Detective
It's been ages since I've sat in a throne
Oh, there's a lot of personality here, isn't there?
Appalling personality,
but quantity over quality, I suppose
Genuine Medieval knights costume in a Bel Air mansion?
This man's home definitely was his castle
Well, it couldn't keep him safe from invaders
Crime scene Let's go
Hang on
That's Dean Cooper, the Los Angeles real-estate tycoon!
Yeah, owns the whole block,
and most of the biggest developments in the city
Including the entire block that Lux is on
Deeply unpleasant man
You wouldn't believe the deal I had
to strike for my lease
All completely legal
If somewhat, well, let's say "morally ambiguous"
Well, that moral ambiguity that he was so famous for
may have finally caught up with him
Ella, cause of death?
Explosive exsanguination from
the carotid, punctured
by this
Like from a champagne flute
Mm-hmm Someone really popped his cork
You know like
You guys, like, the blood's the champagne
Like when you open a bottle, his neck was the
We got it
Did you get any prints?
Killer wiped it clean
Okay, well,
maybe he didn't wipe the glass clean
before it broke Ella, are any of
these pieces here big enough to get a partial from?
Probably not
But, hey, someone invented glue for a reason Right?
You're going to reassemble all those pieces?
I'm fairly certain there are people in Hell being forced
- to do exactly that right now - Oh, I was the kind
of kid who did jigsaw puzzles picture-side down
- That's fascinating - Mm
Oh
What's wrong?
Maze Problem at Lux
Problem? What? One of the Brittanies stub her toe?
You're leaving?
Lucifer, Cooper was one of the most hated men
in the city We have tons of suspects to go over
And if I don't get there soon,
Maze will undoubtedly fix the problem herself, which usually
- involves knives - But
So unless you want to be blamed
for a four-toed Brittany
Uh hello?
We're closed
Hi, okay, we've got some anomalies here,
especially with the quarterlies
Maze, did you forget
to bribe the inspectors this month?
Are you the proprietor?
I am, yes
And who are you, lounging around like you own the place?
Oh, I actually do own the place
Lucifer Morningstar,
you're being evicted
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
All right, explain what you mean by "evicted,"
and do it carefully as your life may depend on it
Okay, Mr Morningstar My name is Eric Cooper
I've assumed all of Cooper's holding
and assets, Lux among them
You're Dean Cooper's son
Your father was just brutally murdered, and here you
scant hours after you were notified,
divvying up the spoils
I don't know whether to be horrified or impressed
What happened to my father was unfortunate
Yes
But business is business
Well, impressed it is
Your father and I made a deal for me to live here,
so I'm sure you and I can come to some agreement
Tell me, Eric, what is it you desire?
I want my father to turn over in his grave
Hated the old man, eh?
Well, I can relate to that
My father's not on my Christmas card list either
In fact, I moved here to get away from him
Surely you can understand that
No, not really
And I saw your "lease"
It was written in lipstick on a stripper's thong
- Not exactly legally binding - Hm
Well, maybe we can write the new one in blood
I find that to be quite binding
Let's not
You have no legal right to be here,
so if you don't vacate,
I'll have you removed
It's not that easy to remove me
Last time, it took the power of God
What do you have A few expensive lawyers?
Or are you gonna do it yourself?
Not in front of all of these humans
If I were you, I'd leave
That's fine
This is a police matter now
Let's go
- All right, let's go - Let's go, man
It's not like you to get in the way
of a good eviscerating, Maze
What was that about?
You'd be eviscerating the wrong person
This is your mother's doing
Mum? How?
You told her you want to stay here on Earth
Now someone's trying to take Lux away from you
Don't be absurd, Maze
I just saw American Psycho's father
The man wasn't destroyed by the Goddess of Creation
He was killed in a fit of human passion
But that greasy weasel might be right
This is a police matter Lucky me
Don't act like your mother
isn't capable of this, Lucifer
Ah, that's enough help from you today Maze, thank you
All right, fine
You can't see it, I'll find someone who will
I don't see it
Of course you don't
So after you said you'd "handle things,"
you're hiding behind her skirt again?
I am handling things, Maze
Mom and I are trying to find a way back home
So why would she murder some human?
That woman is
dangerous, duplicitous
And she's standing right behind me, isn't she?
Pardon my interruption,
but what am I being blamed for now?
I know what you're doing,
trying to take away Lucifer's home on Earth,
so he can help you get back
to the Silver City
It won't work
The demon is talking,
but not making any sense
Typical, I suppose
She thinks you killed the man
who owns Lux to get Lucifer evicted
Mazikeen
If I did come up with such a plan,
do you think it would be you who figured it out?
Whatever you're up to,
I will find out
Oh, she thinks she's smart
Mom?
You weren't actually involved in that man's death,
- right? - Well, of course not
But it might be able to be used to our advantage
Maybe Lucifer will agree to come home with us now
Right
All my sons are important
It isn't about Lucifer
It's about our family
I've already lost a son
I will not leave another one behind
It doesn't matter, Mom
Lucifer loves that place
And no human is gonna make him give it up
as long as it's still standing
Is that so?
Careful
And that is how we do it!
Ta' vonlu!
Ta' von what?
It's Klingon for "the king is trapped"
In Star Trek, they play three-dimensional chess
Okay
And I'm gonna check this for prints now
- Great - No problem
Hey
All our info on Dean Cooper
No rap sheet, which, quite frankly, is pretty amazing
considering his reputation
Great Thank you
Hey, are you busy? I could use an assist on this case
Nah, Vice has me wrapped up
on a bomb-making case I got to rush back
Where's Lucifer?
Something came up at his club I don't think he's coming back
Oh, well, don't worry, Chloe He never stays away
for too long, right?
Hmm?
Huh
Hey, Lucifer So, did you splint
the stubbed toe, or did you kiss it and make it better?
Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence
that Eric Cooper's the killer
Mm, actually we do
Prints just came back
Eric Cooper
How did you?
Never mind I'll meet you at the Cooper building
So wonderful that you agree with me for a change, Detective
Perhaps you're getting smarter
I don't agree with you
I have actual evidence on Eric Cooper
that I need to look into
- What do you have? - Motive
Little shark liquidated his father
so he could liquidate his assets
How do you know he's liquidating assets?
Because he's trying to evict me from Lux
and sell off the building
You're saying that Dean Cooper's son
is making deals just an hour
- after his father was found dead? - Exactly
- What could be more suspicious? - Hey
When were you gonna mention that you're
personally involved in the case?
When you asked me
Nope
This an extremely high profile case
We are doing this by the book
I cannot have you terrorizing him
I would never
Or threatening to tear his arms off
That happened one time
Or hanging him from a window
I solemnly promise that the man's feet
will remain firmly on the ground
What's that?
Somebody call an ambulance
Check this out
There's a guy on the car!
Is he alive?
That's Eric Cooper
Just to be clear, that wasn't me
I mean, who leaps from the seventh floor?
13th, minimum This is the man forcing me from my home,
he can't even make a proper suicide jump
- Lucifer - Is this really necessary?
Well, witnesses saw him jump off a balcony
by his own free will
He was distraught
That doesn't make him a killer
Well, it points to a guilty conscience
Christi, I know this might be hard to hear, but
we have evidence that Eric was in his father's house
before he died
We live in the same compound
I'm sure there's DNA or whatever all over the house
You can't actually think that he killed his own father
Well, I mean
Let's not forget
Eric's insatiable lust
for Daddy's cold hard cash
If he's willing to do something as monstrous
as turning me out of my house,
then killing his father
isn't such a stretch, is it?
Ooh!
My Left Foot's trying to speak
N-No
money
Shh, baby
Don't talk
What are you trying to say, Eric?
Dad
ran the business into the ground
We were buried in debt
I thought making emergency sales
could save us, but
But what, baby?
There's nothing left
I'm sorry, I
I couldn't live with disappointing you
Well, if this is about money,
you should have called me first, before taking that swan dive
Perhaps you'd like to renegotiate now?
I can't
The deal is made
How could a sale be made so fast?
Dean Cooper died yesterday
Is this that deal for all the property on the strip?
There's been a buyer interested in that for years
Eric's dad had it all drawn up and then
just let it sit on his desk
He just wanted to torture the buyer
So, you made the sale as soon as you heard
your father was gone?
Dad couldn't block it anymore
But it didn't matter
It wasn't enough
What we have is enough
You and me
We don't need money for that
What a wonderful day
Potentially homeless and definitely nauseated
Well, whoever bought Lux stood to gain
from Dean Cooper's death
Yes This man,
the person who owns Lux now What's his name?
Her It's Eleanor Bloom
Detective, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I doubt it
But let's go talk to Eleanor Bloom
- Yeah - Thank you
Thank you
Oh, God
I think you're in the wrong place, lady
- You're Kevin Burnick - I am
Why? You come to take a peek at the legend?
According to the docket, one of your clients
is a known explosives expert
named Patrick O'Neil
I need his help
to get my son to come back home with me
You look hot and sound crazy,
which is totally my type
But I don't talk about my clients out of court
It's a lawyer thing
Oh, you misunderstand me
I'm his lawyer now
You can go home
Look, lady
I don't know what you've heard about me,
but when the K-Dog gets a bone,
he doesn't let go
Touch me, and I will sue you
so hard
Oh
So, you think I had something to do with Dean Cooper's death?
Well, barely an hour after he was killed, you closed on a deal
he'd been obstructing for years
Sounds convenient
- Sounds like good business to me - Cooper intentionally
gave you businesswoman blue balls
just to torture you
- It's rather cruel - And I bought
his favorite golf course last year and turned it
into a landfill for medical waste
Oh, I see Well played
So, you're saying this was all
a multi-million dollar prank war?
I'm saying I didn't kill him over a deal
Besides, I just flew in from Macau this afternoon
Check with the airstrip You have any other questions,
you can ask my lawyer
Not so fast, Mommy Warbucks
I have some questions for you myself
Lucifer, you promised that you wouldn't
Detective, this woman has my home
If you're gonna give me some sob story
Oh, far from it
I know your type You don't respond to emotion,
or intimidation
The only thing that gets you going is a deal
So, let's make a deal, shall we?
What do you desire?
Tell me and it's yours
I want everything Dean Cooper has
Well, Cooper owned Lux
So, how about everything apart from that?
Everything
All I want is what was his
And then to destroy it
So, you're gonna tear down all of his properties?
I'm a developer I'm gonna knock everything down
and then rebuild
Even Lux?
Especially that place
That's prime real estate
I'm gonna build a mega-mall
A "mega-mall"?
Yeah, you know, Gymboree, Sunglass Hut
Bulldozers get rolling as soon as my people finish
emptying the buildings
You know,
a murder investigation can tie up a development for years
I know you know more than you're telling us
So, if there is any way,
at all, that you can help this investigation,
that would be wonderful
She's good
I could use a few of her on my team
The accountants I had looking over the deal
did find several unreported payments
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
You don't hide money like that
unless you don't want anyone to find it
Bloom was right
Dean Cooper was making large off-the-books payments
and hiding them from his company
Well, could be anything
Drugs, blackmail
There's no shortage of bad deeds in Dean Cooper's life
I'm gonna try and trace where these payments went
Maybe our killer's on the other end
Oh, delightful
Whilst you do that, I'm gonna return
to Eleanor Bloom's office and get my home back
Not sure she's interested in selling
Well, maybe she'll change her mind
after I turn her world into a sphincter-loosening nightmare
Ew Lucifer
I'm sorry about your home I am
But you have to promise me you're not really gonna hurt this woman
Well, then, help me, Detective Arrest her!
I mean, isn't contributing to homelessness
in Los Angeles a crime?
Lucifer, the law is on Bloom's side here
I want to help you, but we have to find a legal solution
Okay So I'm on my own, am I?
That's not what I
We know you build bombs for the mob, Patrick
That's ridiculous
I I deliver pizzas
Yeah
We cracked your code
"Hoping to get a delivery
at Slauson and La Brea tomorrow night
Enough pepperoni to feed a family of four"
The mafia, the cartels,
when they hear that we have you in custody,
and they think for a second about your
ingenious pizza code,
they're gonna want to keep you quiet
So, uh
you can help me out, right?
Depends
Hmm! Hands off my client, Officer
You're not his lawyer
The accused has a constitutional right
to be counseled by whomever they choose
She can be my lawyer
I understand your confusion
You're very attractive
I've found that can also mean
you're not very intelligent
I've already posted your bail
No Wait, wait, wait I-I can't afford that
Oh, don't worry, I take payment in trade
Is it true that you know how to make bombs?
That's what I'm accused of
Yeah?
Have you ever brought down a building before?
I know how it's done
I need you to destroy a nightclub for me
Let's get out of here, guys
Hands off
- my piano! - Hey, man,
we're just doing a job We don't want any trouble
You think you can come in here and take apart my life
without any trouble?
You gentlemen
have no idea who you're dealing with, do you?
Well
let me show you
This building was supposed to be empty
Oh, you know Lucifer, Mom
He wasn't gonna let this place go without a fight
Or a drink
This is what humans call
a "sit-in"
What are you doing here?
Well, I was gonna blow the building up with C4
- Mom, you can't - I know
My client is a coward
And very difficult to convince him to kill this many people
- No, Mom, that's-that's not what I - I may be able to
use this to my advantage
To what do I owe the honor
of your presence?
I disagree with you wholeheartedly
about wanting to stay here
But a mother doesn't have to
agree with her son in order to support him
So
what is it exactly I'm supposed to sit in?
Mum
You're actually being a good mum
We may have our disagreements,
but you're still my son
I don't want to lose you again
Oh! Doctor!
Mum, this is my therapist, Dr Linda
Doctor, this is my mom in a disturbingly hot body
Lucifer,
I'm sure that sounds strange
to her human brain
Oh, no, don't worry, Mum, Dr Linda's had a crash-course
in celestial beings
Only melted her brain for about a week
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have guests to get back to
I'm sure you'll get on like a house on fire
So you're, uh
God's wife
Ex-wife
Oh
I prefer to not be defined by Him
Oh, of course, of course
Well, I just want to say,
it's an honor to meet you
Thank you for
for all of this
Existence
And I wanted to thank you
for taking such good care of my son
You're so welcome
Our relationship must give you a lot to talk about
Mm
I'm not telling you anything about our sessions
Simon Halbrooks, of Private Investigative Solutions
That's my company
Built it myself
Hmm Dean Cooper made several off-the-books
six-figure payments to you in the last few weeks
Those payments were off of his books, not off mine
I'm legit
What kind of legit business has clients
hide their payments to you?
Do you trust your fellow officers, Detective?
Excuse me?
Do you know for sure they wouldn't take a bribe?
Rat you out for the right price?
How can you know who to trust?
I'm the guy who answers those questions
And how do you do that?
Think of me as a professional tempter
People hire me to find out
if their R&D guy would sell secrets
Or if a famous couple's nanny
could be bribed for pictures of their kids
So whose loyalty were you testing at Cooper's company?
That's privileged information
I just thought you'd want to know, we got calls
about some kind of an illegal party at Lux
Oh thanks
Oh!
Stormtroopers have arrived, everyone
Don't worry, I'll deal with the boys in blue
You are the boys in blue, aren't you?
The strippers aren't due for another hour
Detective
What are you doing with them?
I know him I'll handle this
You sure, Detective?
I can reason with him
This doesn't need to be a scene, I got it
Okay, guys, let's go
Thanks, guys
Lucifer, what the hell were you thinking?
I
Turn the music back on, this place is dead
Well, you heard the lady
Crank it up!
Detective,
does that mean you're on my side now?
Lucifer, this is your home, I've always been on your side
Well,
if you're gonna stay, come on, stay
- No, I don't want to dance - No, no, no, come on
- You're the guest of honor now - I don't want to
Come on!
He really does love this place, doesn't he?
Yeah
This place
My son was right about you, Doctor
You are
quite insightful
You know, for a moment there,
you were actually having fun, Detective
Ooh
Obviously it was temporary insanity
as now you're back at work
Well, as any parent knows the best time to get things done
is when everyone else is asleep
So, what have we got?
Well, I've been going through these payments
to our professional tempter, and none of them match up
to the timing of any of Cooper's new hires
I just can't figure out who they were investigating
Riveting, but I meant what have we got to prevent my club
from being bulldozed into a Cinnabon?
Lucifer, I'm sorry but that trick that I pulled last night
is only gonna work once
I can't see another way to save this place
Well, then, we need to look harder, Detective
This is about more than me
I mean, do you know the history of sin in this place?
It was a, an institution
decades before I ran it
Th-that crack
in that mirror there
That crack is still there
from when Ava Gardner threw a scotch glass at Sinatra's head
Hmm
Underneath here there's prohibition tunnels everywhere
Howard Hughes used to use them to sneak his mistresses
away from his other mistresses
And that stool that you're sitting on,
that very stool, Detective,
this may disturb and titillate you
We have to go see Simon Halbrooks again
I think I know
- who he had Cooper looking into - Well, I'm sorry,
I can't leave Lux undefended
Really?
Okay
Eleanor Bloom's entire
moving crew is passed out on your floor
The police aren't gonna be here for at least another day
Lux is fine
I really need your help here
Really?
You don't trust her, either, do you?
It's not what you think, Maze
Listen, when I first came to Earth,
I made certain mistakes, all right?
I'm just making sure Mom doesn't make the same ones
That's it I'm protecting her
Right
She didn't tell you who she was meeting, did she?
So who do you think it is, hmm?
An assassin?
A terrorist?
I'm quite sure it's no one so dramatic
Oh
I did not see that coming
I saw a sadness in you
A sadness and a strength
Look, I know this is
forward of me but
you want to grab a drink in my room?
I mean I probably shouldn't
Oh, you definitely shouldn't
I mean, I'm all for
examining your innermost desires,
but at least examine your options first
Uh, hey, buddy
I'm working here
Indeed you are, in that it's literally
your job to seduce her,
and report back to her fiancée's
wealthy parents
Or am I wrong?
Mm
Oh, something I said?
You don't just tempt potential employees, Simon
You also go after potential spouses
Dean Cooper's payments started
to you just after his son got engaged to Christi
Care to explain?
It's true
Old Man Cooper didn't trust Christi
She came from Nowheresville, Michigan,
where they put cars on blocks in yards
So Dean Cooper thought she was after his son's money,
and hired you to prove that she was just a gold digger?
And I approached her
Rented Bentley, fake Rolex, the whole nine yards
I laid it on thick
And? Did she sleep with you?
She passed
She stayed faithful
What, you couldn't seduce her with your fake Rolex?
Well, color me shocked
Hey, man, my success rate is pretty high
She was really in love with her fiancée
It happens sometimes
So if she didn't cheat, then what happened with Dean Cooper?
I told the old man the truth
But it didn't matter, he didn't like her
Even if there was no evidence of her cheating,
he wanted me to make some
"Make some?"
I photoshopped pictures of her
in some compromising positions
What?
It was a lot of money
So Dean Cooper tried to blackmail Christi
into breaking off her engagement
with fake proof of her cheating?
That's some serious motive for murder
The poor girl was just trying to find
a place to belong
And you, you vile insect,
took that away from her
If you ask me, she killed the wrong man
Lucifer, come on
All right Detective,
this man is a professional homewrecker!
And when it gets out, what he's done,
he will be out of business
That will have to be punishment enough
Please
Very well, Detective
I'm not gonna lie
I was, um
I was pretty surprised when you called me
Even more surprised
you actually invited me out
You know, as soon as I walked into that interrogation room,
I felt a spark between us
Yeah?
Me, too
I'm surprised you're still single
Lucky me
Look, I'm gonna be honest with you,
I've been a little bit gun-shy
about the whole dating thing
You know, since my split
No, I understand
I went through a bad breakup, myself
Honestly, I was in Hell
for what felt like forever
I've only recently come back
What happened with you two?
Was there someone else?
No, no
No, nothing like that
But
But?
Well, there's this-this guy
that she spends a lot of time with
And he definitely has a thing for her, but I
I mean, I don't know if it's reciprocated, but
- you know, I - Go on
I think you were right, Maze
They must be discussing some evil, terrible plans
And we must stop them
No, let's let it play out
Just to be safe
Wow You know,
I haven't really had anyone to
talk about my ex with
And it feels really good to get it out
Yes, it certainly does clarify things
Whoa, whoa, uh, wait,
I'm so sorry
I, um,
I totally over-shared, didn't I?
I
I haven't done this in a while
And
I screwed it up
Well, I suppose I do have some time and
you are fairly attractive
What?
Oh
Oh, that's a keeper
Come on, let's go
I know where he lives
I'm not gonna go watch my mother make out with Dan!
They're not gonna make out
They're gonna
I know what they're gonna go do, Maze!
Fine I'll report back
Maze, stop
This is just a
an innocent date
An innocent date?
- With Chloe's ex? - Yeah, they're colleagues
She was in Hell for thousands of years,
and he's a good enough looking guy
Please don't make me explain this any more
But it is so much fun to torture you
Look,
I'm not gonna interfere with my mother
enjoying a little bit of happiness
Please
Fine
It's not like I wanted to watch, anyway
Even I have my limits
It's me
Forget the building, I need a smaller charge
For say, one person
Don't worry about that
I'm going to do this one myself
Mr Cooper, sorry to bother you
We just have a few more questions
Can your fiancée vouch for your whereabouts
the morning your father was killed?
No, she was out looking for a venue for the wedding
Why?
- Well - What is this?
I thought Eric had been cleared of the charges
Oh, he has
Because we now know that you're the one
who killed your father-in-law, Christi
What?
Eric's father created fake evidence
that you were cheating and tried to blackmail you into leaving
And then he had
a little champagne toast to evil while he did it
No wonder you wanted to jam it down his throat
I
No
No, I did it
My father, he-he showed me the evidence
and I knew it was fake
Christi would never
And-and the fact that he would
stoop so low, I couldn't help myself
I flew into a rage
Well, if that's the case,
Eric Cooper, you're under arrest
No!
It was me It happened
all like you said
Christi
I'm-I'm the one who did it, not Eric
I think he did it
You two realize that if you confess to this crime,
there's a good chance you both will go to jail?
Whatever we face,
we face together
I don't understand
The one of you who didn't do it, you'll lose everything
No, we won't
No one was willing to stand next to you
in front of the bulldozers?
No
No, I sent everybody home
Thought I'd say my good-byes on my own
Good-byes?
I thought you were gonna fight for this place
Well, it occurred to me that
much as I love this place, uh,
I can always build a new one
I mean, it wasn't the walls that made it my home
The people
Yes
Well, the women
But they'll flock to any new place I go to, so
Hmm
Well, that makes this sort of anticlimactic
But Lux has been named
a Heritage Site by Los Angeles County
Detective, is this
I had a friend in the city council
push it through
And I used your, uh,
little history lesson as inspiration
Lux is protected now
It can't be demolished for development
Detective, you
you saved my home
Well, you'd still have to buy it back
from Eleanor Bloom, I'm sure well above market price
But
you can afford it
I
I-I mean, I simply don't know what to say
I'm-I'm normally the one doing the favors
And for a price
Friends help each other out
Yeah, well,
let me at least buy you dinner tonight
To celebrate
I know this amazing steakhouse
and-and the chef's an absolute artist in the kitchen
I mean, he's also a degenerate gambler
and owes me a favor
Otherwise, you'll just go home
and eat one of those poisonous sandwiches
you get from the vending machine at work
Come on, Detective
Friends help each other out
She saved Lux
No strings attached
I-I didn't even ask
Well, Chloe saw that your home
is a very important place to you
Does it really surprise you
that she'd want to help you protect it?
Well, I
People make gestures like that
all the time
You just saw two people go to jail for each other
But those people were clearly insane
Now their home is a jail cell
You realized earlier that "home" meant more to you than Lux
That you could lose Lux
and still have a place here
Because Los Angeles is my home
Lux or no
Are you sure that's what you were really looking for?
Well, what else would it be?
Something occurred to me
when you introduced me to your mother
Why is it that
I'm the only human in your life
who knows who you really are?
Because you asked me, remember?
You insisted that I show you
Detective Decker has asked you many times
And I always tell her the truth
But you know she doesn't believe you
You could show her
your true face,
but you don't
Why is that?
Do you think it's because
you might be afraid
of how she might react?
Because you care
that much about what she thinks of you?
No, I-I-I'm sorry
Doctor, I don't really understand
where you're going with this
I think you did come to Los Angeles
looking for something
But I also think you've stopped
Because maybe you've found it

Previously on Lucifer
You stalked your father's murderer
right before he was killed
I know this looks bad
Whoever killed Joe Fields killed my father
What, you think the warden did it?
This man killed my father
You tore
apart my family
I can get you whatever you want
All I want is for you to know
that John Decker's kid got you
His name is Boris Sokolov He connects criminals,
but he always keeps his own hands clean
People call me Human Lie Detector
So, you point me in the right direction
or I'm gonna make your life a living hell
Mom, this is Lucifer Lucifer, Mom
Mama Decker
You shall remain right here
on Earth amongst the creatures you so despise
You're going to send me into the life of Charlotte Richards?
I thought I'd dive into my employment
I was pretty surprised when you called me
You are fairly attractive
The only place I've ever felt
wanted or respected
Is here with humanity?!
This is my home!
Deal with it, Mother!
You seem attached
to these creatures and I can't figure out why
Let me at least buy you dinner tonight to celebrate
Excuse me
- Yeah - I'll get it for you
Thank you
You can't kill her, Mom
Well, of course I can
I just press this button
Mom, please
give me the detonator
No This little bug is the reason
that Lucifer doesn't want to go home
Squash her, problem solved
Are you really gonna make me force it away from you?
Trust me, you don't want to do that
But I can't let you kill Chloe, Mom
Since when can you
I tried to warn you
Apparently, paltry human flesh can't
contain my divinity
Oh, here we go
Bomb's in the car
So exciting
Mom, stop!
I am trying to help you
I know Lucifer better than he knows himself
and if you kill Chloe,
he won't rest until he finds out who did it
and when he does, Mom,
he will hate you forever
Come on
One little human can't mean more to him than his family
He killed Uriel to protect her
Well
what's so damn special about this one?
That I don't know
But, Mom, the bottom line is
if we want Luci to go home with us,
then we need to make sure that it's his decision
to leave Chloe behind
Well, that was anticlimactic
So, I need to find
a more subtle way
to end Lucifer's silly crush
Tell me everything
Well, there's
nothing to say, really
You had a date
with Chloe
That's a big deal, Lucifer
I need to hear about it
You know, as your therapist
Well, for one, I wouldn't say it was a big deal and
it wasn't a date, just dinner
more like a snack, actually, between friends
Oh, how was the food?
I've heard their branzino is amazing
Well, yeah, it's
hard to say, really
Too caught up in the moment to notice?
Caught up, in-in a way, yes
You chickened out, didn't you?
What?
I'm the Devil, Doctor
I don't chicken out
I just simply thought that she should
enjoy the food without any
distractions
Listen, you know, I get it
Our last breakthrough spooked you
and now you're running scared
I don't "run scared" any more than I "chicken"
Not literally
But you're avoiding the truth
Also known as lying
That I know I don't do ever
But yet
you are lying, Lucifer
to yourself
I owe you an explanation
Really? Why?
Was it for
leaving me all alone at a restaurant so the busboy
could give me pitiful glances all night?
I know what your explanation is and I don't want
to know her name, especially not today
Actually, Detective, that isn't what I was going to say, I
Look, Lucifer, I don't have time for this
I was just on my way out
Besides, this is my fault
I should've known how selfish and thoughtless you can be
Lucifer
How thoughtful
Penelope
You are the sweetest
to come support us on such a difficult day
Oh I bet you
an arm and a leg, Mom,
that he has no idea what today is
Well, that's rather unwise of you to wager your lovely
extremities, Detective
Particularly as I'm perfectly aware
of what today is, actually
It's a very difficult day
because
- Today - Today is
- The first day - The first day
of the of
trial of the trial of
- my dad's killer - My dad's killer!
Nietzsche? No, wait
Your dad's killer Yes, no, I knew that
I knew that That's why I'm here, to support you
Not talk about myself 'cause that would be selfish
- Yeah - So
consider me
an emotional jockstrap
for the Decker family jewels
Hey
Hmm, someone's chirpy for a Monday morning
Yes, I am
Why?
What's going on?
What, do I need an excuse to be happy?
Hmm, I mean, you're whistling
You've been working out lately
Mm
Musk-scented aftershave
Did you
get laid?
No
Oh, no, no
Don't waste your poker face on me, buddy
I know that grin
I'm still in shock
I knew it
- She's gorgeous - Yeah, well,
- it's not like you're Quasimodo - No, no, no, no
Trust me, she is way out of my league
I mean, she is
goddess-like
And she came back for seconds
Then maybe she's the one who sent you the mystery package
A mystery package?
Mm-hmm
I don't recognize the return address
Oh, jeez
God!
Wish I could say it was my first
That's Boris
Chloe's gonna lose it
So poised
The detective obviously gets her strength from you
This?
It's just acting
Sadly, I've had practice
I played this role before, 16 years ago
Well, maybe it's like butt stuff
Easier the second time around
The severed head of Boris Sokolov
just arrived at the precinct
That's horrible!
Who's Boris?
He's the prosecution's key witness
He's our key witness
He was the only person that could connect Perry
to the Russian gang I mean, without him,
the entire case could fall apart
Oh, God
How very convenient for Mr Perry
This is the worst thing that could be happening right now
What are you up to now, Mother?
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
I had no idea Charlotte Richards
was defending Perry
Wishing we hadn't saved her life about now
Well, not to worry, Detective
I hear Charlotte is a changed woman
since her disappearance, so
maybe she's not the shark she once was
At least not in the courtroom
All rise
Court is now in session
The Honorable Judge Estrada presiding
Given the sudden death
of the State's number one witness,
I assume the defense is moving for a dismissal?
A motion for dismissal?
Why would I want that, Your Honor?
Looks like Jaws
has been harpooned
My apologies
I'm a little out of practice
Um
Oh, I see
You're saying that with Boris dead,
the State doesn't have enough evidence to proceed?
So, if I don't move for dismissal,
then he'll probably make a complete fool of himself?
Your Honor, our case was
and still is unshakable
The State has plenty
of other evidence that'll prove 16 years ago,
the defendant, Perry Smith,
murdered Officer John Decker
and paid Joe Fields to go to prison for that crime
Oh, and when Fields wanted out of their deal,
Perry also killed him
Your Honor, with all due respect,
granting a dismissal
would be ludicrous
Boris Sokolov's death,
while undoubtedly tragic,
changes nothing
Well, the defense agrees
What?
His death doesn't change a single thing
With or without Mr Sokolov's testimony,
my client should never have been charged
with these crimes
Well
seeing as both parties agree,
the trial will proceed immediately
Actually, Your Honor,
the State would like to, uh,
request a continuance
In light of the death of our key witness,
our office needs time to, uh, reexamine
its strategy
But I'm confused, Your Honor
Didn't we just hear the prosecution say
their case was "unshakable"?
We did
Request denied
Session will resume after lunch
What the hell are you doing, Mother?
Oh, calm down, Lucifer
This isn't pleasant for me, either
Oh, yes, I can see you're suffering terribly
I was good up there, wasn't I?
Not sure why humans spend so much time in law school
Two nights seemed plenty
Mum
I had to find a way to open your eyes
You need to see that this Chloe you so adore
isn't worthy of you
I admit I enjoy working with her, but adore,
that's a bit much
Oh, please You've sacrificed more for her
than you ever have for anyone else
Have you forgotten? You killed your brother,
my son, to protect her
Do you think there's anything even remotely similar
that she would do for you?
I suppose
I don't know
Well, if all goes according to plan in that courtroom,
you will know
Know that she doesn't deserve you,
because she doesn't care about you
like you care about her
You need to see that you're not meant to be together
You belong with your family
Which is why I have to do this
Do what, Mum?
What sort of evil plan are you concocting?
And please don't tell me it began by killing Boris
Oh, actually, that was just a happy twist of fate
I was gonna blow Chloe up,
but Amenadiel talked me out of it
You what?!
Mother, I swear, if you hurt her, I will rip
Well, looks like your brother was right
Just promise me that you won't touch her
I'm not going to hurt anyone
Lucifer, you promise me,
whatever that was, that it doesn't affect the trial
First of all, Detective, there is no "that"
And secondly, rest assured, everything will be okay
I've got this
You looking for Boris' forensics report?
Uh-huh
Hasn't come in yet
Ella should have it any minute now
I know this isn't my case, but I'm freaking out, Dan
I can't let Perry get away with everything
You won't
You didn't see Charlotte Richards in court today
Char?
I'm sorry Uh,
Charlotte Richards is, uh, defending Perry?
Yeah
Really? She's that good?
Yes, she's the best
Which is why it would be helpful if we could
Well, if you could tie Perry to Boris' murder
Okay, well, motive and MO line up
Boris' tongue was cut out
So the killer was sending a really clear message
Loose lips get their head clipped
Perry did this so Boris couldn't testify, I know it
But hasn't he been behind bars since you arrested him?
Yeah, but he could have orchestrated it in prison
It's also his MO
Exactly, and if Perry is good at anything,
it's making other people pay for his crimes
Okay, well, whoever Perry hired to do this
was one sharp dude
The cut on Boris' neck is extremely precise
I'm thinking industrial-size professional slicer
Listen, I'm gonna do everything I can to find him
Even if I have to interview the owner
of every single meat slicer in LA
You won't have to
There was also non-human DNA on Boris
Swine, to be exact
A unique cross-bred for its delicious meat
And there's only one place that sells it
Ah!
Hi
That's so sweet of you, but you don't have to stick around
- Trials can be so boring - Well,
not this one
What do you mean?
Mr Morningstar,
we're ready for you
Wonderful Lovely Right
Off I go to shield you from that Quid Pro Ho, Detective
Lucifer, what are you doing?
Well, I figured there's no reason for us
to lose our heads just because Boris lost his
I swear to tell the truth, he whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,
so help me Dad
Mr Morningstar,
you were there when Boris was arrested
Right? Working with Detective Espinoza
That is correct
Except I call him Detective Douche
But that's another story
So would you please describe to us
what happened?
Yes, I'd love to, actually
May-may I have the floor?
By all means
Thank you
I'm going to need
Hello
May I borrow your scarf?
Your Honor, is this necessary?
Well, you want the full story, don't you?
I mean, the Devil's in the details
Thank you ever so much
Right Myself and Detective Douche
Sorry, Detective Espinoza
Were asked by the LAPD
to perform a sting operation
Not the singer
So we had to go undercover
at Boris' bathhouse
Guns of steel
Got up there
Walked over like he's constantly got
a gun between his legs
Boris looked me in the eye, and he said,
"People call me human lie detector"
He was going to kill
Shook my hand like some kind of Roman warrior
and it was sealed, and I handed over the investigation
to Detective Decker
Thank you
I got a question
Do you ever get the feeling like you've been used?
You mean, by Oh, I don't know
The woman who's defending the killer of your ex-wife's dad?
What?
Charlotte Richards is the gorgeous lady
you slept with, right?
How the hell did you know that?
Well, I saw a long, honey-blonde hair
on your coat the other day
It was curlier than Chloe's And then,
I spotted a smudge of lipstick
on your cuff Burgundy shade
Bold, but not too sexy Lawyer color
Really?
No I just saw your butt pucker
when Chloe mentioned her name in the lab this morning
God
Why are you so worried?
I mean, you didn't tell her anything about the case
that she could use in court, right?
- I don't think so, but - There you go
Mezcal cocktails, man
Oof Those sneak up on you
She did keep wanting to talk about our exes,
and all I thought was, you know what, she's so easy to talk to
She's so sympathetic
God, I'm such an idiot
- Hey - No, her taking Perry's case
right after we
It can't be a coincidence
Why not?
- Maybe she really just likes you - Yeah
- 44 - Hi We'll take
the headless body of a dude named Boris, please
I was going to call you guys
I was just scared
A few days ago, this guy approached me
Big creepy dude
He demanded the keys to use the equipment after hours
No questions asked, unless I wanted
to end up in the sausage myself
- Do you know his name? - No
Asian, big
Very scary
But the scar on his neck it's very distinctive
Thank you, Mr Morningstar
What a, uh, vivid picture
It's almost as if Boris himself just testified
Except a more handsome version
Oh, stop it, Judy
Thank you
Right actually, to that,
I would like to add one more thing, if I may
I think we've had enough, Your Honor
Shh! Please
continue Luc
Mr Morningstar
Thank you, my darling
Yes, I'd just like to say, for the record,
the LAPD, and Detective Decker, in particular,
acted impeccably on this case
This whole courtroom, nay, the entire city
can rest assured that someone as honest,
trustworthy, and reliable as Detective Decker
is out there protecting them
She is truly good
And I don't mean in bed
I wouldn't know
That's how good she is
Thank you
Miss Richards?
Your witness
I have no questions at this time
Hey!
That's Chloe's car
What are you looking for?
Hey
I was, um
You
I was looking for you
Really?
Yeah, I've missed you
It's true, I still think about you, Maze
Every day And every time that I see you, it's
I miss you, too
It's like fireworks, isn't it?
But are you sure that's the kind
you're looking for?
Or was it this?
One tell your mother no one is hurting Chloe on my watch
And, two
Don't ever lie to me like that again
And what did Boris have to say
when you interrogated him?
He confessed that he routinely provided fall guys
for the Russian gang that runs the prison
where the defendants worked since the late '90s
And is there anything else
that is remarkable about this prison?
It is the very prison whose corruption
John Decker was investigating
when he was murdered 16 years ago
Holy cow
It's all so coincidental, isn't it?
Just like the odd timing of Boris' murder
I withdraw that, Your Honor
No further questions
Thank you, Detective
I have no questions for this witness
The prosecution rests, Your Honor
Your turn to shine, Ms Richards
As its first witness,
the defense would like to recall Lucifer Morningstar
Oh, it's fine
Just one small question, Mr Morningstar
And please remember that you're still
under oath
Who was first on the Fields crime scene?
First on the scene was the detective, I believe
I'm sorry, which detective?
Detective Decker
Are you sure? How do you know?
Quite sure Yeah, she told me
It's kind of strange, isn't it,
for the man accused of killing John Decker
to be found dead by Decker's own daughter,
Chloe Decker?
Objection, Your Honor Relevance?
I'm getting to that
Would you please read who,
according to the official police report,
was the first officer on the scene?
What's wrong?
I'll tell you later
Well, it says Detective Espinoza
I thought you said Chloe Decker was an impeccable detective
Objection, Your Honor!
No, I-I'd like to answer that
She is That's why she
took herself off the investigation immediately
But not until after she'd found her dad's killer dead?
Objection!
What's he objecting to Air quotes?
I'm simply stating that if what we just heard is true,
then there's a very plausible alternative story
to the one that the State is presenting
Chloe Decker had motive, opportunity,
and the LAPD to protect her and help her frame
an innocent man for her personal vendetta
With all due respect, Your Honor,
Chloe Decker is not on trial here
And my client shouldn't be, either
Because it appears he is the victim
of the LAPD's incompetence
Unless, of course, the report is right,
and it is you that is lying, Mr Morningstar?
What you're implying is preposterous
The Detective would never hurt anyone
But yes
What I said is the truth
Under oath or otherwise
I don't lie
Detective?
Please
Trust me, you do not want to talk to me right now
You're right, I don't You look scary
But look, I apologize for my controversial testimony,
but I was clearly bamboozled
You didn't expect me to lie on the stand, did you?
It's not about your answers
It's about Charlotte's questions
She wouldn't have even asked them unless she already knew
I was first on scene
Let's see Who could've told her?
Detective, I didn't
You say that, but you also said
your relationship with Charlotte wouldn't affect this trial
It just did
Detective!
Charlotte?
How could you do this to me?
What exactly?
I've done several things to you
Did you sleep with me to get intel on this case?
Of course, but it's not like you didn't get anything out of it
"Mind altering," I believe you called it
Yeah, literally, apparently
Because I don't remember telling you anything about this case
- Did you roofie me or something? - I didn't need to
I've learned sex puts your gender into a mild coma
Offered the perfect window to go through your phone
So, maybe
next time, you should put your phone away
before we have the sex
"Next time"?
Mm-hmm
Are you insane?
You tell me
I wish I could say that I'm surprised
Maze blew up your car
She is
Maze
I know, right?
Slightest provocation,
- and she turns into a little - Hellion?
Exactly
Let me ask you though
Why do you think that she reacted so
passionately?
Because she's a complete maniac fueled by rage and violence
Now, as your friend, not your therapist,
you feel you did nothing at all to anger her?
Well, s
Maybe not nothing
I may have obscured the truth a bit
- Otherwise known as lying - Linda,
I had no choice You have to understand that
Oh, I do Oh, I do You were you were dealing
with matters of great importance
So important, you feel justified
to act any way you see fit
Even if that means hurting people you care about
You "did what you had to do"
That's, uh
that's what I did to you
I treated Maze the same way that I treated you
Yeah, except I'm just your friend
And Maze is
well, more
So, it's way worse
And as my friend,
your advice is?
Apologize your ass off
Or next time, she might blow that up
Maybe you don't understand
Mommy Dearest tried to kill Chloe
Oh, I understand She told me
- She did? - Yes We're past that
What I don't understand, though,
is how the detective can think I'm the one
who leaked sensitive information to my mum
How could she?
Yeah, Chloe's the bad guy
Mm
If only I knew who really gave Mom that information
Right If only
Oh! Good You came
Yes, he did
Thanks for coming, Dan
Anything up lately?
I don't know You tell me
Lucifer called me here
Yes Well, I was thinking, as my testimony didn't go
quite as planned, that it might help fix things to prove
that Perry was behind Boris' killing
- Already working on it, man - Fantastic!
Well then, please tell me you have some scintillating
cop-speak on how to accomplish that tiny task
Well, uh, the guy who chopped Boris's head off had this scar
It's actually a brand
Signature of the Alhambra Triads,
they're a Chinese crime syndicate
Lots of them were in the prison that Perry ran
Triads hate the Russians, so
makes sense to pit them against each other
Yeah You should definitely probe this angle
Mm
Rumors are they use a Chinese cultural center as a front
Right Well, let's start there then, shall we?
These guys
are notoriously violent, so let's try to get
in and out as quickly as possible, all right?
Oh, speaking of "in and out,"
this case really seems to be touching you, Dan
You know, in a very personal way
All right Shh Yeah It's personal, obviously
Just try to keep it down, all right?
Well, it's almost like you want to take
Charlotte Richards down yourself
Like, way down, and give her a hard time
What are you trying to say, Maze?
Yes, what are you driving at, Maze?
"Driving at"
Good one
N-No I'm just
really impressed with how much Dan wants to penetrate
this thing from every
position
You know?
- Oh, yeah - Know what?
I bet that's what she said, didn't she?
Oh, yeah!
Oh, Dan!
- Big boy - All right, all right!
Fine
Yes It's my fault
I leaked the information to Charlotte
Among other things
I'm why she knew Chloe was first at the scene
She must have looked at my text messages after we
You what?
Made love
You slept with my M-arlotte?
You bastard!
Whoa!
Oh, now look what you've done
Wha?
Da-da Don't be a Dan
I'll deal with this
Right
Which one of you chaps is in charge?
Oh, very well
You speak Chinese?
- What? - I'm the Devil
Of course I speak Chinese I speak everything
Lucifer Morningstar
Lovely
Furen Li Chunhua
Daniel
What's he saying over there?
No idea
Xie xie
Okeydokes I think I've brokered a fair deal
Madame Li is gonna give us the man who killed Boris
All we have to do is defeat Kang
And who the hell is Kang?
And who's supposed to fight him?
- Aww, hell no - No, no
Much as I'd like to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Douche,
I'd actually like to win this I was pointing at Maze
Why not?
Okay, sure
She's terrifying
But what happens if we lose?
They kill us
Well, you
'Cause I'm immortal
Right Shall we?
Choose your weapon
I choose those
You done?
Hoo-ah
She likes that move
Down, girl
- Are you serious? - Well,
I mean, you did get two new toys
Well, that sucked
Hmm?
But a deal's a deal
- Indeed - The one you seek
was banished for working outside the family
We don't break bread with strangers
You'll find him at this address
Xie Xie
No problem
See? Easy peasy, Chinese-y
Dan's got a lead
on Boris' killer, and it may implicate Perry
So, if he is responsible, it might not matter
what happens in this trial
Well, that's great, 'cause we are getting our asses kicked
Well I have to testify next
I just hope I don't make things worse
Oh, you'll do great, honey You're a pro
Right, Mom A real pro
Like when I followed the prison van
Mom, what if I'm the reason Dad's killer goes free?
Don't you dare
No father in the world was more proud of his daughter
than your dad
And nothing you could do in that courtroom
or anywhere will ever change that
I just miss him
I want him to get the justice he deserves
Justice is what we all want, dear
For your father,
and for my client
You're a mother
Aren't you?
Yes
Then shame on you
We need to talk
Man, he better be here
If we can convince him to give up Perry,
I won't feel so bad about having slept with Charl
La la la la! No more talk
of that disgusting offense, please
I thought you said you hadn't slept with her
I haven't, wouldn't ever
I'm just upset for the detective
What, you think I'm not?
I would do anything to right this
I know you would
LAPD! Put your hands where I can see 'em!
Whoa!
Well, looks like we found Boris,
at the head of the table, ironically
And that's Da Young I'd say we were right
Perry hired him to go behind the Triad's back
to kill Boris, knowing that they'd punish him for it
Clever Perry, killed two birds with one stone
Three, if you count the chicken
You've got a lot of nerve
Yes, I've been told
And legs for days
Now, listen, you're losing bad
Without Boris, the prosecution's evidence
is mostly circumstantial
And, unfortunately for you,
Lucifer's testimony basically handed me
a non-guilty verdict
This trial is over
Maybe
But the investigation into that monster
that you call a client is ongoing
So one way or another,
he wi
Hmm
Bad news?
I may have a solution
My client isn't fully aware we're winning
However, he is more than aware
that he's facing the death penalty
And we both know he's a coward
I could use the possibility
of a lethal injection to get him to plead guilty
You're supposed to be on his side
Why are you doing this?
Well, there is one condition
You'd have to betray Lucifer
So
you want Perry to go to jail,
call Lucifer a liar
"A liar"?
If there's one thing he cares about more than anything,
it's his honor
See you in court
Detective Decker,
Lucifer Morningstar is your partner, correct?
Yes
He's a civilian consultant for the LAPD
We work cases together
And how is he qualified for this role?
He is very, uh, intuitive
He, um, understands people's desires
And in addition to that,
I assume he studied law enforcement?
Not to my knowledge, no
Oh, okay
But he has a professional background,
which is somehow relevant to law enforcement?
He owns a nightclub
Okay, but then,
I'm sure his previous job
was more relevant to his role
as a civilian consultant for the LAPD?
- Right? - Mm
Well, if you believe his claims
that he used to run Hell
then yes, he's accustomed to punishing bad guys
It's true
I'm confused, Detective
Are you suggesting your partner is delusional,
or just lying?
Lucifer Morningstar is many things,
but he is not a liar
Everything that Mr Morningstar said
on this stand is absolutely true
I was the first person on that crime scene
And, yes, I shouldn't have been anywhere near it
But I
let my emotions
get the best of me
Lucifer is the
best partner
I have ever had
And I can only hope that he can count on me
as much as I count on him
Your Honor, we request the jury be instructed
to disregard Detective Decker's entire testimony
We'll take a ten-minute recess
Harry, are you surprised
by that "not guilty" verdict?
No I'm never surprised to see justice served
I believe in our legal system
And now I can finally return to my family
a free man, so, if you'll excuse me
I'm sorry to bother you, um, I was, um
I'm looking for Maze
Do you know what apartment she lives in?
Oh, yes, but she's not home
Why, did you get in a fight?
I'm sorry, it's none of my business
It's just, my husband
always gave me flowers after an argument
Are you all right?
I used to believe
everything happens for a reason
But now, I'm not so sure
Me, neither
But I do know that no matter how bad things get,
the true test is how we choose to respond
to the pain we suffer
Or inflict
That's well said
Maze is a lucky girl
Hope she forgives you
Ha! Huh
I'm sorry, you you look really familiar
I'm Chloe's mom?
Have we met?
No, I don't believe we have
I never forget a face
If you'll excuse me, I have to go
Oh
Good night, Rosie
Perry Smith
I know you had Boris killed
I also know you're responsible
for the murder of Jill Fields
and John Decker
Aw, such a shame there's no evidence, right?
The system kind of needs proof
Yeah
You clean your mess, we got nada
But you know who's okay with nada?
Or shall I say nichego?
Yeah, that's right
You see, the Russians,
they don't like it when one of their own
is taken out without permission
But who knows?
Maybe they won't hear about it
Whoa
Aah!
My pleasure, Meesha
Dozvidanya
I didn't think you had it in you
I'm impressed
Drive
You were right
You are nothing like Father
Oh? What changed your mind?
If I tell you this, you have to come
completely clean with me, Mother
No more secrets, Mom No more lies
Okay
What happened?
35 years ago, Father,
He asked me to come down here
to bless a couple who was unable to have a child
He had never asked me to do anything of this sort,
and He never did again
Today
I met the mother again
And I found out what the result
of that miracle was
Or, rather, who
- Oh, hey - Detective
- Sorry, I thought - What are you doing here?
Are you on your way out?
I am, yes
- Oh - To see you, actually
Oh
I believe I owe you dinner
Now we know why Chloe's so special
Don't we?
Your Father put her here
In Lucifer's path
You know what this means?
It means that I was a pawn
Say when
When!
When
I hope you know it takes months
to get a reservation at this place
Oh, yeah The fries are amazing
Oh, thank you I made them myself
It means Chloe's not an obstacle
She's how you'll get your wings back
She's how we'll get it all back
Detective?
What you said today in the courtroom
It was the truth
We're going home, son
And Chloe is the Key

Previously on Lucifer
- You slept with my - Whoa!
I know you had Boris killed And John Decker
Aw, such a shame
- there's no evidence, right? - You see, the Russians,
they don't like it when one of their own is taken out
without permission
I didn't think you had it in you
I'm impressed
You want Perry to go to jail,
call Lucifer a liar
"A liar"?
Lucifer is not a liar
He is the
best partner I have ever had
And I can only hope that he can count on me
as much as I count on him
Your Father put her here
In Lucifer's path
It means Chloe's not an obstacle
She's how we'll get it all back
Detective
what you said today in the courtroom
It was the truth
I, um
What?
Well, I-I got you burgers and fries but I forgot the ketchup
I hate ketchup
Foolish condiment
Lucifer!
Hello!
This is your flight attendant speaking
Please buckle up
Jana?
I didn't know you were expecting company
I wasn't I
Surprise layover in LA,
I thought we could rack up some miles
She's welcome to join, if she's game
Excuse me
Wait No Detective
I had no idea that Jana was coming over
It's okay I'll let you two catch up
Detective, please! Come on
I mean, we were we were having a moment
Don't be angry
I'm not angry
I'm glad she showed up
- You are? - Yeah
She just kept me from making a big mistake
Detective!
I Jana
Wheels up, Captain?
I'm afraid this flight's grounded
As long as you are mine
As long as you are mine
As long as you are mine
You want some juice with your eggs, honey?
- I don't like eggs - What?
Since when don't you like eggs?
They're a wondrously scrumptious start to your day
Give me that
Who got you this? Maze?
They're my favorite
Please, please, Mommy?
Honey
Okay But only because I missed story time
Were you working last night?
Uh, no
I had a little dinner
With who?
Uh, Lucifer
Oh
So if you weren't working,
was it, like, a date?
With flowers and candles and songs about naked stuff?
No! Definitely no
It wasn't a it wasn't a date It-it really wasn't
Then why are your cheeks getting red, Mommy?
My cheeks aren't getting red
Check it out
Oh Yeah I had no idea you were so concerned
about LA's water shortages
- What? No - Yeah
Wrong side
Someone got his ass
Yeah
Monkey, go get your backpack
I'm good I'll stay here
Yeah Someone told me he died this morning I heard
Wait, why aren't you happy?
Your father's killer finally got what he deserved
What Perry Smith deserved was to rot in jail
for the rest of his life
But still
Pretty awesome that someone took him out, right?
I bet it hurt
A lot
Whoever did this is no better than he was
Save yourself
Last night
You didn't look at me this way
Ooh
Lucifer
There's something very important we need to discuss
New visitors policy Hot women turning up unannounced
are no longer welcome
Especially those who are secretly my mother
Well, I think you'll make an exception
when you hear what I have to say
Well, spit it out I don't have an eternity here
Oh, yes Actually, I do
I just want you gone
It's about Chloe
What have you done this time?
Son, I don't know how to tell you this
What is it, Mum?
I
was wrong
I wanted to prove to you
that Chloe wasn't worthy of you
I gave her every incentive to turn on you
But she didn't
She impressed me
I'm starting to understand what you see in her
But, uh, regardless, it's a moot point
Why's that?
Because what you couldn't destroy, I did all on my own
Oh?
Look, just call it a case of stewardess interruptus
Perhaps it was for the best
I know you don't believe that
I don't know
what happened between you two
But I do know that Chloe proved herself to you
Maybe now it's your turn
Maybe now it's time that you prove yourself to her
You don't have
to prove anything to me
Well, normally, I would agree with you But you insist
on letting an impossibly attractive flight attendant
come between us And not in the fun way
Lucifer, we are very different people
with very different personalities,
and I'm not judging
I'm a homicide detective, not the slut police
And I mean you, not her
Nothing happened after you left
Not my business if it did
No But what I'm saying is things have changed now,
since we had our moment
We didn't have a moment
Yes we did And I can assure you
Detective, I will never lay eyes on that flight attendant again
You sure about that?
Oh, no Jana
Always with the tragic timing
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
Doesn't seem to be a mugging Cash, credit card, keys,
all still here
- Can you look for her phone? - Yes
Thanks
I'm sorry about your friend
I don't think I deserve the term
We hardly knew each other, really
So a woman showed up to your house for sex
and you barely knew her? Of course that's what happened
Guilty as charged
You want to tell me what happened last night?
Jana left five minutes after you did Alive
I believe you, but can anyone else confirm your story?
Well, I was with 300 of my closest strangers in Lux
I went to the bar right after she left
Well, what about the five minutes before she left?
Are you jealous, Detective?
No I'm just trying to piece together a timeline
A lot can happen in five minutes
You can't be suggesting
That you slept with her? I'm not
No That I'm a two-pump chump
If we'd slept together, she wouldn't have left
until the morning Believe me
Maybe she'd still be alive
Okay, what else can you tell me about Jana?
I need to put together a victim profile
Well, I mean, she gave incredible
And I'm not talking about her sexual skills
- Right - Maybe her last name,
friends, family, where she was staying when she was in LA?
I'm a lover, not a Rolodex
Detective
Found it in the tunnel
Thank you
All threatening texts
All sent from the same number
This last one, just before she got to your place
"Ditch the loser from Lux"?
Oh, this is terrible She was seeing someone else at Lux?
I think it means you
The number on Jana's cell
belongs to a wealthy Silicon Valley guy, Andy Kleinberg
We tracked his phone's GPS
to some swanky Malibu beach house
I'll send you the address, Chloe
What the hell are you doing here?
You see this?
We're basically famous
Are you nuts?
You brag about what we did in a police precinct?
Dude Chill
- I was coming to get my check - Yeah
And I thought
that we could, uh, celebrate our righteous kill
We didn't kill anyone, okay?
We just
We gave karmic justice a little nudge
Oh Is that what we're calling the Russian mob now?
Shh!
Come on!
Let's grab some vodka, we'll make it a theme
Maze, we're not having a drink
We shouldn't even be seen together
until all this blows over Do you get it?
Trying to blend in?
Well, it's not often I get to break out the linen
Speaking of style, I've got to get one of these for Lux
Yeah, that would really tie the place together
- Look, for the last time - Hey, Lucifer
Yes Hello For the last time, Detective,
nothing happened with Jana after you left
I believe you
- It just doesn't - Hey, Lucifer
change anything
Well, why not?
Well, look at this party
I bet this is your your definition of fun, isn't it?
Well, I mean, I prefer scotch in a lowball to sex on the beach
and the drink, I mean But dealer's choice
Okay, well, fun for me
is being home with Trixie, reading her a book
Really?
Yeah
And that's okay, but we're different
Like, too different
Well, as a wise man once said,
"opposites attract"
I believe that was an animated cat
in a music video
- A wise animated cat - Excuse me
Hi I am looking for Andy Kleinberg
Do you know where he is?
Don't waste your time with him
Let me get you a drink
Keep it in your pants, Tommy Bahama
She's spoken for, thank you
No, I'm not
So do you know where Andy is?
Your loss
Oh Thank you
Andy Kleinberg?
You're blocking my view
The view from a jail cell sucks, too
What, is this a joke?
Wait, is this one of George's pranks
to get me back for that stripper?
Hey, are you a stripper?
I'd recommend you stop talking now
Jana Lawrence was found murdered this morning
She was my stewardess on my flight yesterday So?
So you sent her a threatening text
"Ditch the loser from Lux"
Yeah
She said she was hooking up
with some DJ named Lucifer
DJ? How dare you!
"Meet me now, or else"?
Yeah, or else this is shut off No mas
Look, I sent that text
to, like, 25 girls last night
It's called a "booty call" You ever have one?
Of course not Booties call me
Sometimes
Look, is there anyone who can prove
you not having sex?
Oh, I had sex
Meet Sharon
Hey, Lucifer
Oh, yeah
She can attest to my whereabouts
all night long
And she can, too
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to go somewhere where you two are not
- Charming - You know
you and him have a lot in common
We are nothing alike
Really? Right
Well, that is clearly off the rack
Inferior linen
Not remotely the same
Regardless, I don't think he's our killer
Let's go talk to your friend Sharon
See if his alibi checks out
She's not my friend She's just a woman that I
No, actually, that's worse
Right, where to, then?
There's been another murder
Ballistics match our flight attendant
The victim was in the shower when he was killed
Signs of a struggle Looks like he was tortured, too
So Jana's killer had it in
for this poor chap as well, did they?
On the upside, looks like he didn't have
anything to do with this case after all
Pretty sure you didn't sleep with this guy
Uh, actually, you're wrong about that, Detective
Raj So fit
This isn't good
What, that a man was one of my lovers?
Come now, Detective, it's the 21st century
It's not that,
it's that you slept with both victims
We've been trying to find a connection
between the two, and so far
all we have is you
Well, I wish I could help you
What, you didn't get details between the sweet nothings?
Quite a few, actually
But they were mostly about what he desired,
which I doubt you want to hear
What if this whole thing is about desire?
You've been with a lot of people
What if one of them got jealous
and wanted you all to themselves?
What, you think one of my exes is
killing off the others?
Look, I've seen what your exes are capable of
Charlotte Richards, to name one
Bloody hell, for the last time,
she is not an ex
Either way, we should warn them
that they could be in trouble
While Dan's looking into other connections
between our victims, we should talk to
anyone you've slept with
Oh, that's a brilliant plan
It is?
Well, what better way to prove my word to you
than a bevy of exes singing my praises?
Sure
That's definitely what's gonna happen
- Yeah - Okay,
a list of everyone you've slept with
in the last eight weeks
Right, you'll need a much bigger notepad
One, two, three, unh!
Hot pants
Hey, hot pants
Unh, no, hey
Ha
Hot pants
Hey, hot pants
Smokin'
Ow!
Girl over there
With the hot pants on
Filthy MacNasty
All night long
Get down
Wow
You slept with all of them?
Yes Bit of a dry spell the last couple of months
This is a waste of time
I refuse to believe that one of my former lovers
would kill another
Yeah, well, so far we don't have
any other connections
And people will go to crazy lengths
for the ones they love, even if they're the ones
who suggested the split
and still have feelings, even though they shouldn't
What on earth are you talking about?
Did I just say that out loud?
- Yes - Oh Never mind
Right
It was an amazing,
amazing night
But the next day, Lucifer was with
another woman, so did that make you jealous?
Jealous? Why?
Well, because he basically
used you for sex and moved on
- Did that bother you? - I knew what I was in for
And what were you in for?
The best night of my life
The best night of my life
The best night of my life
The best night of my life
The best night of my life
You know, this is actually feeling
a bit masturbatory, even for me
Though clearly not the words of a killer
He knew exactly what I wanted
And he did this thing
He did this thing
He even did this thing with a Pan flute
and a butternut squash
I was improvising
I didn't have any zucchinis
He did this thing with my Tibetan singing pot
and artisan honey
It's a game I play called,
"Do I make you horny, honey?"
with some Vaseline and a car battery
- What? - That was a move I call,
"Gentlemen, start your engines"
It's bloody brilliant
Did you and Lucifer have any intimate moments?
Obviously, we were intimate
We were hella intimate Mm!
Did you not hear about the honey? I mean
We're talking about, um, emotional intimacy
Like, um
did Lucifer, uh, bring you dinner?
Or did he
do anything special for you?
Get you a burger, fries?
What? No
Look, it was a rad night
and morning
and afternoon
- But that's all - Mm
I mean, I certainly wouldn't hurt anyone over him
- What? - No
There was no reason to hurt anyone
I mean, he was just a meaningless
- one-night-stand - Mm
- It was just about sex - It's just sex
It's just sex
There was no emotional connection
That was it, it was fun,
but completely meaningless
- Just fun - but meaningless
- Meaningless - It meant nothing Nada
I never saw him again
See where I'm going with this?
Well, look, man, the good news is
none of them has motive to be the killer
Yes Because none of them cared enough about me
to murder
Thanks for calling me in
I actually wanted to speak with you
Wait a minute, why is she here?
I don't know I keep telling the detective she's not my ex
I wanted to tell you that
you impressed me
Really?
- Yeah - Mm
I underestimated you
I gave you all the reason in the world
to betray Lucifer
You did During that case
you went to incredible lengths
to hurt Lucifer
I did nothing of the sort
You took that case just to try and get me
to call Lucifer a liar in court
True, but I would never hurt Lucifer
I was trying to prove
that you weren't worthy of him
I see What about the other women
that you don't think are worthy of him?
What'd you do to them?
Nothing
They are inconsequential
You're different
He's different when he's with you
Does that threaten you?
Perhaps at first
Not anymore
It makes me happy
I'm glad he found someone
He deserves a woman like you in his life
Have you slept with him yet?
What?
See?
You're different
Where were you the night of the 27th?
Hey, listen, man, you're not gonna, uh
You're not gonna tell Chloe about
me and Charlotte, right?
Well, as long as you promise to never
touch Charlotte again
No, it's not a problem
Good 'Cause the last thing I need is a step-Dan
You say some really weird things, man
You ever do something awesome for somebody,
and they just don't care?
I'm a therapist
Being taken for granted is in the job description
Like, for example, when a friend
uses your lunch break for free therapy,
and doesn't say thank you
You want me to take care of this friend of yours?
Yea It's fine
So how do you deal with it?
I just realize that self-worth comes from within
You can't rely on others
to validate you
I don't care what anyone thinks of me
Of course you do, we all do
You know, and that's okay
That's human
I'm a demon
I actually think you're more human
than a lot of people I know
Take that back
Okay, okay, you're a good friend
and a great pers
Demon
You just need to realize it for yourself
Not because I said it
You're saying I'm awesome
I'm saying that you need to say that you're awesome
Believe that you're awesome
Yes, you're awesome
Hell yeah I am
Thanks, Doc
Do you notice anything
out of the ordinary?
Did anyone threaten you?
I mean, there was that one girl
What girl?
The creepy weirdo
She was always in a corner of the club
She just gave this death stare
Daggers
Okay, can you give me a description?
Well, I can describe her aura
That's okay
Her name is Suki Price
A number of your exes confirmed seeing her lurking around Lux,
so we ran her description through the DMV
Are you sure you don't recognize her?
No, which is strange, 'cause I remember
the face of everyone I've been with
Oh, maybe she's mask girl
Halloween?
What? No President's Day
Or maybe, I don't remember
'cause it was just another meaningless encounter
This case not the trip down memory lane you were hoping for?
Oh, it's almost enough to make a man
question the way he's lived his life
Almost
Well, luckily this girl gives me hope
At least one of my former lovers might be willing to kill for me
Oh It's open
LAPD Anyone home?
Well, this isn't creepy at all
See? I told you someone cared
Look at this
Multiple chest hair options Amazing
I can make a lasting impression
Yeah, on someone with serious issues
This woman is clearly deranged,
dangerous, and
Why am I on this wall?
Well, maybe she can just sense the inevitable
Suki Price? LAPD
What're you doing in my
Lucifer!
- Okay, hey, hey - What
Hey, come out with your hands up
This is one of your exes?
Do you know, I'm really not sure
I darling, could you do this?
And say, "I am not a crook"
No, it's definitely not Sexy Richard Nixon
I'm quite certain we've not slept together
Well, I could have told you that
Care to explain the wall?
Oh I'm just
really into Lucifer
And who could blame you
You're my perfect man
Like porn and stuffed crust pizza
and my Hello Kitty blankie all rolled into one
I've loved you from afar
Right
I see what's happened here
Not having sex with me drove her into a murderous,
psychotic rage
Murder?
What are you talking about?
We're investigating the deaths of Jana Lawrence
and Raj Daniere Have you heard of 'em?
I have all of Lucifer's lovers categorized
Uh, uh
here is the flight attendant section
Here's Jana with Raj
So the two of them knew each other?
Raj is Jana's GBFFN
Was her GBFFN
A gay best friend for now
Oh
She sometimes crashed on his couch whenever she was in LA
Hmm And w-what are these numbers about here?
Date from two days ago
The last time Lucifer and Jana
hooked up
Right Much as I admire
your dedication to this creepy stalker business,
I have to correct you, there was no hookup
But I made a commemorative doll
You're wearing your new suit
Yes, what excellent detail on the French cuffs
That's what I was doing last night
Oh, you can ask the pizza delivery man
He helped me with these
teeny tiny buttons
Ask him
Who's the third person in this photo?
Uh, that's a pilot Jana works with
Those three hang out together all the time
Maybe he knows what happened
Yeah, yeah, I got it
Look, I'm gonna send an officer by
to get a full statement from you
Do not leave town
And abandon Lucifer?
Never
Right, good-bye
I've been stung
All this chemistry
Has got me falling
Italian beans
- Mm-hmm - Oh
And you want me to try this because?
This "espresso" concoction is my favorite thing
about humanity so far
Well, besides sex, but
You're looking well these days
So confident, so cheery
I almost didn't recognize you
Thanks to you, Mom You found a way to get us home
But
manipulating Lucifer and Chloe toward each other
for our own gain
Your Father is the one that started all of this
We are simply bringing it to an end
On our terms
I've tried to manipulate Lucifer before
It didn't end well
That's because you lied to him
Lucifer respects the truth
So use that to get us all home
And then, we can put all of this behind us
This is delicious
Mm-hmm Still not as good as sex
Mom!
Please
Our pilot's name is Tim Pickman
drugs and assault
Used to work for a big airline,
now he flies rich dudes on small jets
His recent routes are
The Caribbean, Mexico City, Ahmedabad
Yes, all hotspots for drug smugglers
O-Or so I'm told
Working for a private airline would be the perfect cover
You have quick travel, lax customs agents
And if Pickman was smuggling drugs,
maybe Jana and Raj found out about it,
threatened to squeal, so he shut 'em up permanently
Yes, murder's handy that way
Okay, where do we find him?
Let's see
FAA reports he filed a last-minute flight plan
Flying Van Nuys to Caracas, takes off in less than an hour
Okay, we got to get to the airport
Fast
Copy that
Lucifer!
What are you thinking?!
Well, I'm pondering Stalker Girl
I mean, how is it the only person infatuated with me
is someone who doesn't even know me?
No, the driving!
You're gonna get us killed!
No, I'm gonna catch our killer, Detective
Better hold on!
Hey
Better hold on
Lucifer!
You're welcome
Captain Pickman, LAPD!
Oh, thank God!
You're a cop
I was afraid you were trying to kill me
What?
So, care to explain why you were trying to flee the country?
My two closest friends just got murdered
I thought I might be next
and I was not about to stick around to find out
Who would try to kill you, Tim?
I only know him as "Burt"
Guy smuggles a lot of drugs into the country
So, were you moving product for him?
No,
he uses young women like Jana to mule
He recruits 'em on the party circuit in Malibu,
offers them cash,
free travel, whatever they desire
Right
And what is it you desire, Tim?
I want to build a cat sanctuary
Wait Oh, for goodness sake
Cat?
I got into trouble using drugs years back
My life fell apart
- But then I adopted Twinkle - Right,
skip along, Tim, 'cause no one really wants to hear
about your feline meet cute
Jana tried to get me to smuggle
for Burt, too,
but I refused
Then why were you running?
On Jana's last flight, a package went missing
A package?
So, what, Burt thought Jana stole it?
And when she didn't have it, he went after Raj
And now, me
Is there any way to get a hold of this guy?
I got a bull's-eye
painted on my back
Why the hell would I want to?
Hmm
Detective
in order to lure out our murderous kingpin from hiding,
all we need to do is for someone to pretend
to have this mysterious package
Yes, and it would need to be someone
who might have worked with Jana
Hmm
Uh, Tim, who else was on the flight?
Just me,
Andy Kleinberg, my copilot,
and a new flight attendant
A new flight attendant?
So Burt may not have known what she looked like?
I'm in
Okay, but you understand what you're agreeing to, right?
Sure
You want me to bounty hunt this Burt scumbag
and pretend to deliver his package
But we'll need you to work with us on this one
We'll set up the meet and everything
Do I still get to rough him up before the cops do?
We'll be close by, but technically, yeah
More in You want to know why?
Because we're running out of time
and you're our only option?
No
Because I'm awesome
Because I take risks for my friends
and I don't need your thanks
Am I supposed to be thanking you for something?
No
Because self-worth comes from within, bitches
Now,
if you'll excuse me,
I need to slut this up
Oh, brother Hello
Just getting ready for a little sting operation
Right
I should've assumed you'd be busy
I can come back
Well, no, no, that's not a euphemism
I mean an actual police sting operation
But actually, whilst you're here
Here
Do you think I'm boyfriend material?
Luci, you've never exactly been the type
to get emotionally attached
To anyone
So I've come to realize, but
what does that say about me, brother?
Is this about Chloe?
And why would you think that?
Mom, she told me what happened
or what almost happened, apparently
Did she now?
So, I suppose you're gonna tell me
humans and the divine don't mix
Luci, listen, I have underestimated you
for all of my existence,
both in your ability to frustrate me
and your capacity for good
Even though you'll never admit it, but
when it comes to Chloe
perhaps you've been underestimating yourself
Careful, brother That sounds dangerously like a compliment
Ah, take it how you like
You never listen to my advice, anyway
Just one of your many charms
Liar
But you're not, Luci
So, if you really want to know
if you're a worthy romantic partner
ask yourself
Can you guys hear me?
Why are you sitting so close?
The killer won't show if this reeks of a setup
Exactly If we were strangers, you'd be hitting on me
Looks like we'll be getting
that celebratory drink after all
Two vodkas, please
Peacock has landed
Okay
Any sign of Burt?
Not yet, but I'll stick around until someone approaches
What?
I think I just figured out what's wrong with you
Oh, yeah? And what would that be, Maze?
You need to own up to what you did
Yeah Be proud of it
Uh, Maze, we talked about this
and besides
Self-worth comes from within, Dan
No, I think I'm good Thank you
I don't think you are
I think you'd feel a lot better
if you just came clean
Don't
If you won't say it, I will
- Maze - For your own good
Don't say another word
Why?
So what if you slept with Charlotte Richards?
Dan slept with Charlotte?
Trust me, you're not half as disgusted by that as I am
Is there anyone who hasn't slept with that woman?
Uh
Which is hard to believe
since you've slept with everyone else in LA
Well, everyone except you, Detective
I mean, not that I want to
I mean, of course I want to, but
right now all I'm concerned about
is proving my worth to you
Unless of course you've changed your mind about the sex
Okay, there will be no sex
As far as our so-called moment,
I let my emotions get the best of me the other night, okay?
I made a mistake
You and me, it's not happening
You have to accept, Lucifer,
that we are very different people
with very different priorities
My priority right now is this case
Okay? So, just
step outside and get some air
I don't need air
Well, I do
Right
Understood
A man just entered the bar
Got you
You are one of the prettiest flight attendants
I've ever seen
- Oh - I'm Burt
Hi, Burt
You ready for takeoff?
They're on their way to the hotel room
Are you ready for the package?
Mm-hmm I think that's supposed to be my line
I know you killed that flight attendant
and her friend, dirtbag
No, no, no! My name's Jim!
Some guy gave me a C-note,
told me to sit next to you and say I was Burt
If that's not our killer then where is he?
I believe you have something that belongs to me
Burt, I presume
Can I keep him?
Get her off me! She's insane!
Well, you better start talking
Where's the man that paid you?
I don't know He saw some tall guy with dark hair in a suit
He took off
That's Lucifer
Yeah
Recognized you from the beach party
Of course Tommy Bahama
It's good that you found me,
'cause I've been meaning to ask you something since then
Where'd you get the water slide?
I'd love one for Lux
I'm not sure where I'd put it
I want my package
Now
I should've known Jana left it with you after I saw her at Lux
That's why she was only there a few minutes to stash it
No, the reason that she left so quickly was because
she was unhappy that I didn't have sex with her
Yeah, I don't believe you
No one says no to a girl like that
I'm finding it hard to believe myself, trust me, but, uh,
as for your package, Burt
I don't have it
Liar
Oh, come now
Surely a little bit of cocaine
isn't worth all the senseless killing
Cocaine?
What's in that package is far more valuable than drugs
- Oh - It's my ass on the line,
and that stupid bitch Jana
You don't speak of her that way
You promised Jana the world
and everything she could ever desire
Money, drugs, a life of pleasure,
but she deserved better than that
better than you
or me
I mean, what did either of us really give her?
Empty pleasure?
Hey, man
we can work something out
I'll find the package I'll get paid We'll
We're similar in a lot of ways, aren't we, Burt?
Except for one
You're a bad man and I'm not
I'm much
much worse than that
Lucifer!
There's your killer, detectives
Think you'll find he feels quite remorseful
about the life he's led
Please okay, p-please, just-just arrest me, okay?
Okay, get up I'm sorry
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry - Stand up
I'm sorry
Hey
About what you heard in the van
Hey, it doesn't matter
except something still bothers me
Burt went to a lot of trouble for a single drug deal
Yeah, well the guy had a reputation to protect
You know? One person steals from him,
everyone else thinks they can, too
All right But then who has the package?
How how did you find me?
I'm sorry I took it I was desperate
I'm broke
When the stewardess let it slip
how much cash she was gonna make from this delivery, I
I thought it was drugs
I was gonna sell them
Then I opened it
One of them broke
I spilled a little on myself Now
What the hell is happening to me?
Hey, I've been looking for you everywhere
I tracked your phone's GPS
Well here I am
Well, we should wrap up the arrest report,
and by that I mean paperwork, not some celebratory drink
that you'll then turn into a moment
Yes, well
I've changed my mind about that, actually
I realized it would never work out between us
- Really? - Yes
So, from now on, no more attempts at moments
I'd be honored to, uh, simply continue working by your side
if you'll have me
Of course
- Good - Yeah
It's not like you to give up, but
Oh, no, I haven't given up
I had a an epiphany, of sorts
You deserve someone worthy of you and that isn't me
That's not what I've been saying, Lucifer
I know It's what I'm saying
You deserve someone better
because you, Detective,
are selfless to a nauseating degree
You always put your daughter first,
even though the ungrateful urchin does nothing
to contribute to the rent
So
you deserve someone worthy of that grace
Someone who knows that every crime scene breaks your heart,
even though you'd never admit it
Someone who actually appreciates
your impossibly boring middle name
Jane
More importantly, Detective, you deserve someone
as good as you
because
well, you're special and I'm
I'm not worth it
Yeah, you're probably right
Detective

Previously on Lucifer 
Tell me, what do you desire?
This is it? This is your big trick?
Why don't I affect you, Detective?
I guess we both have our mysteries
35 years ago, Father asked me to come down here
to bless a couple who was unable to have a child
You look really familiar Have we met?
MOM: Your Father put her in Lucifer's path 
We're going home, son
And Chloe is the key 
Andy Kleinberg? Jana Lawrence was found murdered this morning
KLEINBERG: One of them broke I spilled a little on myself 
What the hell is happening to me?
MAZE: So what if you slept with Charlotte Richards? 
You slept with my
Whoa!
He's different when he's with you
Chloe Decker is causing your vulnerability 
I'm bleeding 
Do you think I'm boyfriend material?
Perhaps you've been underestimating yourself
You deserve someone as good as you
- Previously on Lucifer - Uriel didn't just die
I killed him 
Where's Uriel?
Oh
You look really familiar Have we met?
35 years ago, Father asked me to come down here
to bless a couple who was unable to have a child 
MOM: God put her in Lucifer's path 
Why are you so upset?
Because I just don't know if it's real
Why is it that sometimes I'm immortal, 
and other times I'm all too human? 
Appears you make me vulnerable 
What's in that package is far more valuable than drugs
LUCIFER: You're a bad man 
DAN: Dr Jason Carlisle He saved the dissertation 
while an innocent college student died 
(shouts)
Freeze!
ELLA: We are talking designer poison, here 
So, how do we get an antidote?
Well, that right there is the tricky part
Designer poisons need designer antidotes 
LUCIFER: Detective!
It won't stop
(tires screech)
CHLOE: Lucifer 
The bleeding stopped You don't have to drive like a maniac
You've forgotten you've been poisoned, Detective,
or has it already reached your brain?
Maybe it's just a nosebleed I mean, I-I
How could the professor have injected me?
I didn't get one of his flu shots
What about when you went after him?
Well, I don't know
I tackled him to the ground, we-we struggled for a bit,
and, God, I guess if he injected me somehow,
it would have to be just
- Ugh - Oh, God
Everything's gonna be fine once we get to the hospital
Okay?
We can't go to the hospital
- What? - Lucifer, going to the hospital
didn't help any of the other victims
The only thing that's gonna save my life
is finding the antidote
Otherwise, I'm
All right All right, very well
(tires screech)
No judgments, guys, okay?
You said come right away, so I came right away
You're lucky I remembered to put on pants
eventually So, what's up?
- Well, um - Well, we're worried
that someone else, um, out there might be poisoned
Oh, I doubt it
I asked every hospital in the area to report anything
even resembling a poisoning
So far, haven't heard a peep
Well, just to be sure, let's, uh, let's go over
what you found at the professor's lab, okay?
Check it out
(whispering): Uh, Detective
We should tell her
(whispering): No, we can't
She'll freak out It'll get in the way of the investigation
I really don't think this is a good idea
ELLA: Are you guys done having your whisper fight?
Uh, just make out already and get it over with Yeesh
So I did find
this syringe on the scene
It had a tiny bit of poison left in it, so, yeah, in theory,
someone out there may have been dosed
- Hmm - Okay, but the other poisons
had corresponding antidotes, yeah?
Did you find anything to match this one?
I did
Problem is, dude destroyed whatever was inside
Dick move, right?
I mean, that's why I'm glad no one's reported to any hospitals,
'cause without the antidote,
ugh, they'd end up just like the other victims
You know, first a bloody nose and then
- fainting spells, followed by seizures - We get the point
and then their guts slowly start boiling,
like, literally boiling
It's so gross and nasty, and 24 hours later
- bam, just like that, dead as a doornail - Got it Thank you Yes
- You've painting quite the picture, Miss Lopez - CHLOE: Right
Yeah, let's go over everything else
- from the professor's lab Okay? - LUCIFER: Mm
Just to see if we've missed anything
Okay? Sure
Okay So
Here we go
I got your text What's so urgent?
Uh this way
Somewhere we can speak in private
(grunts)
Was this part of Father's plan?
Hmm?
Answer me, brother,
before I rip your spine out
- and beat you to death with it - What are you talking about?
How long
how long have you been manipulating me?
Mom told you about Chloe?
Oh, that she did
And that you put the detective in my path
No, I didn't
Father did
I was just another pawn in His game
I had no idea
And the detective?
Is she simply another pawn as well or is she
Is she?
She doesn't know anything
Listen
Luci, we've been played like puppets
Father has manipulated us both
Don't you dare compare our situations
All that I have ever wanted to do for all of my existence
was make Father proud
I thought I was doing great works in His name
Instead, the very first of His angels
was busy making you a little girlfriend
Oh Well, my heart bleeds for you
We're on the same side here, brother
Are we?
Then be honest with me, brother
How deep does Father's plan go?
Is the detective's poisoning part of it?
Poisoning?
I don't know what you're talking about
You really don't know?
No
Then you
you can't help her
(sighs)
I'm sorry
(door opens)
There you are I've been looking all over for you
Amenadiel
Give us a minute
I have an idea I need to talk to you
Okay, so the professor's been using this Burt guy
(whispering): to smuggle in the poisons
What, so you think that Burt
might have smuggled the antidotes as well?
- Yes - All right
Point me to his prison cell
Perhaps some toilet wine waterboarding or
(whispering): Well, he's already out on bail,
but the good news is, he does have an ankle bracelet
so he can't get far
(Chloe coughing)
Detective
I'm fine We should go
- Previously on Lucifer - That's Azrael's blade
That's one angry-ass snake
I want my family back
Mom and I are gonna find a way to get back
to the Silver City
One way or another
Something is wrong
It won't stop
The only thing that's gonna save my life
is finding the antidote
The plan is simple:
you kill me, I go down to Hell interrogate the professor,
get the formula, and then you bring me back
Well, you didn't die after all
I heard you saved me
This is your Father's doing
Chloe is his doing,
he put her in your path
So none of it was real?
Don't!
I mean, how can I trust
anything, anyone
now that I know He might be behind it all?
Well, you can trust me
Can I, Mum?
You're as bad as He is
I am tired of being a pawn
I'm done
Lucifer? You here?
How dare he walk out on me
I'm a goddess
Yes, you are
I think I deserve a modicum of respect
I respect you
Then why did my son abandon me?
Wait, we're talking about your son?
Do you know that I went to Hell for him?
I even helped save his scrawny, little human,
who I much prefer dead
This is getting weird
Yeah It's been two weeks and no word
I mean, a mother has needs,
don't you agree?
Okay, uh
I got to go
You're a terrible kisser
Must suck to be on the outs with Lucifer
He hates it when people manipulate him
I didn't
At least not like his Father
True, but you're here
And the big guy's not
I bet Lucifer is
plotting his revenge as we speak
Love the vibe you got going here
It's very Godfather
You even look a bit like Brando
Circa the barefoot, stress-eating years
This is a big move, man
Are you sure about this?
Oh, yes
Now hand it over
It's not gonna go cheap
Worth every penny
It's your funeral
Still no sign of Lucifer?
I went by his place
It's completely packed up
No e-mails, no calls, nothing
He's gone
Just it is what it is
You know, Chloe, you don't have to pretend with me
I know you're upset
I mean, he's your partner, he should've told you
he was leaving
Whatever It's been two weeks
I'm over it
Please just change the subject
Man, I miss Lucifer
He was the best hugger
I mean, squirmer on the outside,
but warm and fuzzy on the inside
Ella
Do you mind?
Oh
Sorry, Decker
Guess he hasn't called you either
So we got Ash Corrigan
27 Cause of death, blunt trauma,
by something that left small circular gashes
around the wound
ME's gonna make me some molds so I can track down
- the murder weapon - Well, it doesn't look like a robbery
I mean, guy's wallet and ID hasn't been touched
His car's still here
I'm thinking Ash was a club-goer
Got into a bar fight,
then everything went to head out here
Hmm
I think he played in a band
Calloused fingers
Guitar player
Good catch
Well, yeah
And this
Looks like the band lost their front man
I can't believe he's gone
We were in such a good place
The album was selling, man
Tour was gonna be huge
This blows so hard
What's gonna happen to us?
Come on, dude, Ash is dead
He's just saying what we're all thinking
The band's over We're screwed
So Ash was staying here?
He was just crashing on the couch last couple weeks
You guys weren't worried
when he didn't come home last night?
We just figured that he hooked up with someone
I hoped, anyway
He's been in a funk since his divorce
It was bad
How bad?
You should talk to Courtney
Ash's ex
She's, um very passionate
They fought non-stop, even got violent once
So the band was right, the ex-wife was violent
Look at these
She was arrested for domestic abuse two years ago
I mean, charges were dropped, but
Detective!
You're okay
What? Yes, of course I'm okay
Don't be so silly
Lucifer, I was really, really worried about you
Shh! Hold that thought
I have news
What
Wow
You just you go AWOL for two weeks,
and then you have the nerve to come here and shush me?
Yeah
You have some serious explaining to do, man
Yes, I know that, Daniel, and I'm about to
Shall we all have a sit down?
No Spill it
I'm dying to know where you've been
Lucifer?
Lucifer?
Uh
Candy, darling,
I told you to wait in the car
But it's so stuffy in there
But it's a convertible
Plus I wanted to show your police friends
just how generous my honey is
He paid that sketchy diamond guy
a ginormous pile of cash for it
Well, mm
Lucifer, who is this?
Right
Meet Candy Morningstar
My wife
Wow
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
It's not how I'd hoped to announce it
I know it might be a tad surprising
No, why would I be surprised?
That you disappeared after I almost died,
and then waltzed back in married to a stripper?
Exotic dancer, but, yes, I can explain
No
No need
I'm happy for you
Really
Do you mind?
Sorry
Am I bugging you?
I'm totally bugging you
No, I love that sound
- Oh - Look, Detective,
I had some family issues
And I-I went to Vegas to blow off some steam
One thing led to another, and
Look, I am sorry, I should've told you that I needed
time off
This isn't about vacation hours,
this isn't about time cards, Lucifer, this
How could you just?
I thought we were
I thought we were friends
Friends? Yes
Friends, that's exactly what we are
Just friends
- Right - Right
So it's all sorted then,
- we'll go back to the way it was - Great
You know, before
Yes, I get it!
- Hey - What?
I have Ash's ex-wife in interrogation
Great
I
That's classy, dude
Real classy
Thank you?
You think they like me?
Oh, what's not to like?
"Violent psycho bitch"
"Sid and Nancy, except she's Sid"
"All she wanted was to crush Ash's soul"
So, Courtney,
care to explain why all of your ex-husband's bandmates
think you're capable of murder?
I had nothing to do with this
Where were you the night of Ash's death?
The same place I am every night: work
I have employees who can vouch for it
What do you do?
Run an online clothing company
Built it from scratch Worked my ass off
You want to know what Ash would say about work?
"The world will provide"
But you know who did?
Me
Someone had to be responsible
The band, they thought I was uncool,
but it was Ash, he was the selfish, childish one
I completely understand
I was with an immature partner,
and it was maddening
It's crazy-making
Yeah, wanted to kill him
I didn't say that
Ouch Shade
I wouldn't take it too personally
Yeah, right
I'm sure it's not me she's talking about
Well, who else would she be talking about?
So, you want to explain
the domestic abuse charge?
Look, we fought
I'm not proud of that
But I've paid for my mistakes, literally
What do you mean?
Ash took everything when we divorced
I agreed to sit down with a divorce mediator,
and the guy was completely biased against me
I think him and Ash
set up some sort of shady side deal
He's the real criminal
But if Ash got this hefty divorce settlement,
then why was he couch-surfing?
Where'd the money go?
Maybe the mediator took it?
Like I said, the guy's a crook
I got him
Someone tagged Lucifer at The Grove
You're kidding
Someone named "Cottoncandy86"?
That's an unfortunate name
No, Mom, it's an Internet never mind
It looks like they were getting frozen yogurt to celebrate
newlywed life?
#mrslucifer, #hottiehubby?
Are you speaking in tongues?
Mom!
Look
He and cottoncandy86 are married
- What?! - He specifically
told me to watch over Chloe
After everything that we did to save her,
I don't I don't understand
Betrothing himself to that?
He wouldn't
Perhaps Mazikeen was right
Lucifer's concocting a plan
Well, Courtney's story checked out
She was working late with two employees
at the time Ash was killed
Courtney's been pointing pretty hard
at their divorce mediator, but I don't know
Seems like a stretch
Yeah, agreed, but I did check it out anyways
This guy named Anthony Annan
He's got a clean record, and nothing
but Courtney's word points to him
Uh, Detective, a word?
You're still here? Shouldn't you be
on some honeymoon far, far away?
Oh, look, it's Mannequin Hair
- Who? - I don't know his name,
but he's in the other photo, too
- Is that weird? - What other photo?
The one of the dead dude
See? Right there
Mannequin Hair is in the crowd
behind the yellow tape
She's right, it's him
Unbelievable
It's highly unlikely for Ash's divorce mediator
to be lurking at the scene of his murder, yes?
Yeah, very
I'll track him down Nice
Well done, Candy
Well, I don't get a lot of names at my job,
so I'm super good with faces
- And other things - Ah
This is fun, isn't it? Isn't this fun?
Hmm? Murder, suspects, clues
Gosh, it feels good to be back
Right, I'm going to call Candy a cab,
and then you and I can get down to brass tacks, yes?
Actually, come to think of it,
who watches over Trixie?
Do you want to go splitsies on a nanny?
Besides, I hear this case involves a band,
so, lucky for you
I bring my much-needed musical expertise
Did you know he plays piano?
Like, better than Elton Tom
I know plenty about music, thank you
Do you, now, Detective?
Right, what's your favorite band, then?
- Hmm? - Hey
Oh, full of '90s jams, I see
The Bangles, N'Sync,
Right Said Fred?
- Give me the phone back - I mean, seriously, Detective,
your music queue alone is enough
to disqualify you from this case
You're not the one who's on this case, Lucifer
What? But what about our partnership?
Our partnership ended when you ghosted me
and the entire department
You can't just march back in here like nothing's wrong
You can't just grab what you want when you want
I'll just put that down there, then
You let me down, Lucifer
I mean, what good is a partner
if I can't depend on you?
I don't need you anymore
Well, surely you don't mean that I do
You can go
Both of you
Right
I haven't seen you in a while, Lucifer
Uh, I know you've been through Hell
I suppose we can discuss that another time
Oh, no, no, there's no need for censoring, Doctor
Candy and I have no secrets
Isn't that the key to a successful marriage?
And how are you coping since your travels?
Any warning signs of lasting trauma?
Denial?
Rash decisions?
Um no, no
I think I've thought through everything quite carefully
He's a thinker, this one!
And, uh and what about Detective Decker?
I thought you two had become
close
Well, everything I felt for her
was smoke and mirrors, courtesy of dear old Dad
I mean, He clearly expected me to zig,
and so I zagged
And does Chloe know that you've zagged Candy?
Yes
She just fired me
- Shocking - I know
But if you felt so manipulated
why return to Chloe at all?
Well, I mean, I tried to leave,
but I just felt that I missed
my work
Look, anyway, baby, bathwater,
the detective and I are quite the crime-fighting duo
I mean, you wouldn't break up
- Batman and Robin, now, would you? - No
We have a job to do
So if she could just see sense
I was fired once
But you know what I did?
I just kept showing up and made myself expandable
Oh, uh, do you mean indispensable?
No Expandable I got a boob job,
and it totally expanded my horizons
Because then, I could do something
none of the other girls could do
You wanna see?
- Ooh, yes - No
No?
But you know, the part about showing up
that's not, actually, bad advice
It's called "acting as if"
Yes Yes, well done, Candy
I think I know exactly how to get back on the case
Oh, gosh, I wish I'd talked to you earlier
Saved myself a trip
Have a candy, Candy
Bad news, Chloe
Ash's mediator won't talk
Well, because he's a lawyer
Yep, not without a warrant
Okay, will do
I know you're there
I'm a cop, Lucifer
You think I don't know when I'm being followed?
All right, fair enough
Look, I'm simply here to help with the case
What, you mean the case that Chloe kicked you off of?
I'm just I'm trying to put things back
the way they were, Dan
Yeah, I've been there
Right And I have a brilliant idea
You expect me to let you go undercover
with your stripper wife?
Right First of all, she's an exotic dancer
"Stripper" is pejorative
Well, far be it from me to disrespect your bride
Thank you And secondly,
Candy is a natural at getting men to talk
Oh, I bet she is
Awesome
Lucifer has outdone himself
Thanks
Mm-hmm
But, Detective, the mediator
won't talk to you without a warrant
Which is why I so wisely made an appointment for Candy and I
this afternoon, see?
You need me
Let me think about that No
Uh, Detective, if I didn't know better,
I'd say you were prejudiced against exotic dancers
Okay, we're done here
- Good-bye - But
Come on, Candy
Well, look, if you change your mind
and wish to take me up on this splendid lead,
then, you know, you can always text me,
or I'm on Wobble now as well
You can get Candy on Cottoncandy86
It was a marvelous idea I'm sure she'll come around
So it's true
You're back
Oh, invading my privacy, as usual, I see
Your brother and I were worried sick
You could have at least called
Oh, my gosh, are you Lucifer's sister?
Oh!
Oh, Lucifer, don't be rude
Who is your top-heavy friend?
Candy, darling, this is my mother
Mum, this is Candy, my wife
I'm sorry that we didn't invite you to the wedding
We just decided
no enemies
Well, lovely to meet you
You're Lucifer's mom?
Oh, my gosh, you look amazing!
I should start using sunscreen
A shame he kept you hidden
I hate secrets
Do you like shopping?
Do I?
I want to hear all about you and Lucifer
You two must have so many plans
So
what do we think of Candy?
Well, I think she's perfect for Lucifer
Her bra size equals her IQ, huh?
That's generous
See that vein popping out the side of your neck?
Same thing happens when I throw the dishes in the trash
instead of washing them
You're mad
I'm an idiot
Look, I know Lucifer better than anyone, okay,
and he does this sometimes
Disappears, does stupid, impulsive things
But he always comes back around, Chloe
Yeah, but this time I don't want him to
I'm serious, I am done I'm done
But he did get you an in with that mediator
That's a good thing, right?
Yeah, well, I don't care
There's no way I'm letting him
and his exotic-dancer wife on my case, or any case
Maybe you and Lucifer need a mediator
Just saying
So, Mrs Morningstar
Oh, no, no, no, no, you can call me Candy
Candy
Why do you want to divorce Lucifer?
Um
Well, I just feel like we're supposed to have a partnership,
and it just totally feels like it's not working anymore
Mm-hmm And you two have been married for
- Five days - Ever!
- Forever - Five days
- Five days - It feels like it
But we've been through a lot in that time,
and I say that we work brilliantly together,
don't we, sweetie?
Well
if you're talking about the bedroom, yeah
I mean, thank God
this bod is made for pure sex,
because, clearly,
it's all he cares about
I'm tired
Eh
Would you say that's the, uh, the crux of your issue?
Oh, the crux of the issue?
Oh, no, no, no, that would he Lucifer
disappearing, and then popping back up
with zero explanation and a ditzy bimbo on his arm
He's cheated on you in five days of marriage?
No, of course I didn't I've been completely faithful
I take the vows of marriage very seriously
And that's why you chose an idiotic, bedazzled tweener
as your partner
I'm sorry, Candy,
there's no name calling in here
Even if it's to yourself
Lucifer,
would you like to respond?
This is gonna be hard for you to understand, but
I've been through Hell recently
Both figuratively and literally
True torment, my greatest fears realized
Lucifer, I am the one who almost died
Yes, I know That is what I'm talking about
Wow
I almost believe you care
Have you ever known me to lie?
I don't know
I don't know
Why don't we take five?
Are you okay, Mrs Morningstar?
Yeah, I'm yeah, thank you I am
Um
I, uh, I had heard through a friend that
you were open to a little extra negotiation
Um, I'm not sure what you mean by that
Um, well, my husband, you see,
has a lot of money
And so, if you were to
swing things my way,
then I'd make it worth your while
Wow
You're really something
But that would be crossing a line
And I can't do things like that
Why not?
You did with Ash Corrigan
You two are in on this together?
- No, we're - Oh, yes
LAPD
We know about your side deal with Ash Corrigan
Didn't pilfer enough money from Ash's ex?
Had to go and kill Ash to get the rest of the spoils?
Whoa I would never, ever hurt Ash
Then what did you want to accomplish, Anthony?
Hmm? Come on
Tell me
What did you desire?
I wanted
Yes?
I wanted the Heavy Woolies to be the hugest band ever
But oh
Um
Okay, yeah, yes, I helped Ash in the divorce
and I got him all of Courtney's money
But there was no side deal, 'cause I did it for free
I did it for the band
I did it for the music
So,
you're a fan?
No, no, no I was the manager
At least, Ash promised me
maybe I could be the manager someday
The point is, I helped them a lot
Ash and I came up with a plan
Buy all the albums himself
using his ex-wife's money to inflate sales
Talk about self-promotion
All they needed was a little nudge
And it worked
I mean, we got on the charts
and we started getting radio play,
we were gonna be booked for this big tour
I mean, we were gonna make it so big
We have a photo linking you to the crime scene
Why were you there?
I was looking for them after the gig,
'cause Ash and Marla, they were fighting
The bassist? Why were they fighting?
When weren't they fighting?
I thought that Ash was gonna kick Marla out of the band
that night after the gig, so I went down there
to see how it went down
That's when I saw the police standing there,
across the street
Over his dead body
It was the night the music died
Perhaps Marla didn't want to be the fifth Beatle
Looks like we have a new suspect
Oh, well, if that's the case, then you're welcome, Detective
It's nice to be needed
Look, go home
Trust me
Candy needs you more than I do
Mine's bigger, right?
Yes Does that mean anything?
Just how much Lucifer loves me
Ah, so these small ones are for couples who don't really care
Exactly
Tell me more
about you and Lucifer
What comes next for you two lovebirds?
Did he say anything
about oh, I don't know matricide?
No, I think the mattress in the penthouse is pretty new
Oh, come on, Candy
I know you two have some kind of plan
Well, you're right about that
So many plans
Tell me everything
Someday
I want to open my own juice bar
Or a tanning salon
Or a combo juice bar
and tanning salon
You're speaking
and yet I don't understand a single word
I get that a lot
Why don't you talk and I'll listen?
I'm a good listener
Like right now? I know exactly
what you're trying to say
- But I didn't - You want what's best
for your son and you'll do anything
to make sure he's happy
I want you to know, I got Lucifer's back
And yours
Because
you're my mom now, too
We're family
She's a sinister
genius
Mother, come on now
Here I thought this "Candy" was an insipid dullard
But she may be the most formidable opponent
I've ever faced
I came away with nothing!
Not a single crumb of information
about Lucifer's real agenda
What if there is no hidden agenda, Mom? Oh
What if this Candy's
exactly who she seems?
Then
I don't understand what Lucifer's doing
- Whatever he wants, as usual - So he really just married
this preening mouth breather because he likes her?
Please
Only a deeply damaged soul would make such a poor choice
Unless
he really is that far gone
Then that would mean that my son
is really, truly broken
And I'm the one that broke him
Mom
don't
I manipulated him
I pushed him too hard
I did this
I'm a terrible mother
Public intoxication, vandalism
Okay, Marla does have a few priors
But all par for the course for a wannabe rock star
How'd you get the lead?
I got in to see the mediator
Lucifer did a thing
Yes, I knew you guys would patch things up
Nope
Not even close
Not even close
Well, it sounds like he's trying to help
Why are you rooting for him?
I'm not rooting for him
Okay, anyhow,
to me, Marla reads like a troublemaker, not a killer
Oh, unless you count crimes against fashion
Yikes
Hey, guys
Remember those marks on Ash's head?
You think they came from the knobs on Marla's bass?
I mean, I still have to do further tests,
but it sure looks like Tetris to me
Okay, maybe Marla's our girl
We got to find her and find that instrument
Yeah, I spoke to her roommate
She said Marla's here somewhere
Yeah
Okay, bye
Excuse me?
Do you recognize this woman?
Yo, my friends, we got a special guest tonight
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lucifer Morningstar!
Hello, Los Angeles
Hello
Oh, you're too kind You're too kind
Hello
This next song is for a, uh, a special someone
A woman who says she doesn't need me anymore
Yeah
Well, I say she's wrong
And I'm gonna prove just what I'm willing to do
for our partnership
That's right, rock a sweet '90s jam
- Previously on Lucifer - Everything I felt for her
was smoke and mirrors, courtesy of Dad
Did you sleep with me to get intel on this case?
- Of course - What are you doing here?
You don't let your girl go into enemy territory alone
The piece is here
My last words were a clue
A clue? A clue to what?
Well, you're the one who has to figure that out, aren't you?
And you really think that this is
the Flaming Sword?
It's so not flaming
That's because only you,
my Lightbringer, can ignite it
That's it It's all I've got
Okay Then we'll fix it There's plenty of time
Just not for me
I do intend to use the Flaming Sword
to cut through the Gates of Heaven
Once I do that,
I plan on kicking Mom into Heaven
and slamming the gates on her backside
Won't God destroy her?
Hopefully, they tear each other apart
Then they'll both get what they deserve
I'm not the Devil, I'm just a man who's delusional
I made it all up I made it all up
_
I'm doing great
Great
Great is good
Okay, good talk
Same time next week?
Uh, sorry, it's just that
some of the things that you said
in our last session
raised some issues for me
Do tell So this secret plan
to cut through the Gates of Heaven
Well, actually, we've hit a bit of a snag with that
The Flaming Sword's kaput
Now, we can't work out what's wrong with it,
and until we can, we're in a bit of a holding pattern
- Ah, that's a relief - Well, why would you say that?
God and His ex having a fight to the death?
Sounds kind of bad for, you know, humanity
Oh, you'll probably be fine
Probably?
That's not exactly reassuring
What does Maze think of your plan?
Well, I don't know I haven't told her
Hence the secret part of the secret plan
- She's your best friend - Yes, well,
as much as I love my little sex thug,
Maze can do things that she thinks are in my best interest
that turn out to be, well, disastrous
And I can't afford that
- Hmm - But the good news is
she's busy focusing on her new bestie right now
The detective
They're practically inseparable
Hey, roomie
- Where you going? - Maze, hey
Um, I'm on my way to work I'm running late
Oh, no, but you haven't had breakfast, come on
Previously on Lucifer
Operation "Help Lucifer Escape From the Hospital"
And you, my dear doctor,
are going to help me Let's go
The three of you plan to use
this Flaming Sword
to cut through the gates of Heaven and go home
- What does Maze think of your plan? - Well, I don't know; I haven't told her
So what, are you going on a vacation?
Lucifer didn't tell you
We're all going back to Heaven
She's been acting very odd recently, on edge
This obsession with getting home
is a bit much, don't you think?
That's because only you,
my Lightbringer, can ignite it
- That's it? - It's all I've got!
You have to try harder
I'm not broken; the sword must be
This is what Uriel was trying to tell me
There's another piece missing
Lucifer, we need to talk about something
What Can it wait?
I'm busy keeping an eye on our mercurial mother
No, it's important I think you might be in danger
Is it the Yakuza?
The Nephilim?
One Million Mums?
It's Maze
She's angry with you, brother
Well, is it Tuesday already?
Anger is Maze's default setting,
sort of baked into her demon DNA
No, this is different, Luci
I think you really need to talk to her
She'll get over it; she always does
Right now, we have bigger issues to deal with,
like whether or not Mum is wasting our time
If she believes her client
has found another piece of the Flaming Sword, so do I
Oh, such a loyal son
But Mum hasn't adapted to this world as well as you might think
This chap could be conning her
- I think I'm gonna go make sure - She seems to be doing just fine
That's not the money, is it?
Of course not She wouldn't bring it to the meeting
Oh, no Of course not
I mean, that would be absurd, wouldn't it?
She's just showing it to him
I mean, it's not like she's gonna hand it to him
before she gets the piece
That's great
And now she's letting him leave Marvelous
Well, that went well
- Oh, you think so, do you? - I do
He has what we need in his safe in the back room
- Oh - He's going to get it right now
Mum, you just handed him a briefcase full of cash
with no proof whatsoever he has what we need
- And? - You've been conned
He's a client of mine, darling
I don't think he'd be that foolhardy
Oh
Well, I'm sure he'll be right back
Maybe we should go check just to be sure
I think that's a good idea, don't you?
Oh
Huh See? He didn't con me
Look, instead he's dead, and someone robbed him
of what's ours much better
Well, the good news is, after this spectacular bungling,
I happen to work with a homicide detective
If you find the killer,
then you'll find our piece of the Flaming Sword
- Hey, but, Mom - The challenge is
making sure we catch the case before some other detective
- But what about - I may be able to help
Really? I'm all ears
- Is everything all right here? - Yeah, everything's fine, Maze
You can, uh, you-you can put away the knives
We'll be in touch, Dr Martin
Excuse me
Uh, Maze
Maze
Oh, my Lord
Who the hell was that?
That was the chairman of the ethics review board
- Are you okay? - No
No, I am not
No, Maze No, no, no, don't, don't
That won't do any good
What happened?
A couple of weeks ago, I maybe, sort of
helped Lucifer break out of a mental institution
Using my own name
- It's my fault, really - No, it is not your fault
It is Lucifer's fault It's always Lucifer's fault
First, I find out he's ditching me to go to Heaven,
and now he's hurting you
Look, I'm gonna fix this, Linda
And then him and I are gonna have a little talk
- Hey, I should get my own desk - Not happening
Right next to yours would probably be best
Definitely not happening
Why are you hovering over me?
I'm not hovering I'm just spending time with my partner
Oh, well, since you're here,
why don't you help me with this paperwork
I could really get used to this, partner
Right Yes, on second thought,
maybe a desk in the far corner might
- Mm-mm - Oh! Ms Richards
Detective Decker Just the woman I was hoping to see
Well, I feel the opposite If you'll excuse me
Hear me out
A client of mine called He sounded very worried
I think he might be in terrible danger
Oh, that's awful
- Detective, we should do something - He's at a bar downtown
Would you come with me and make sure that he's okay?
Nope
- Nope? - I'm a homicide cop
I do not go around checking on worried criminals
like a nanny, Charlotte
- So if we're done here - I heard things
On a on-on the phone call
Like?
Fingers pointing
You heard fingers pointing?
Very angrily
Yes
Also, a gunshot
Sounded like he was
dying, or, um
melting?
It's hard to tell
- Charlotte - It sounds worth our time, actually
Agreed
Why didn't you just lead with that?
The lock's damaged
Is it?
Looks like you're right
He's been dead about an hour
Oh? Impressive guess, Detective
Uh, I'm assuming from the
discoloration
Well, that wasn't a complete Dumpster fire,
but now that we're finished, you can see yourself out
I'll do nothing of the sort
Fine I'll show you out, if you insist
I'm not going anywhere
But the detective and I have got everything handled now
This is far too important to leave to just the two of you
- I will stick around - Mum
Besides, we'll get to work together
Won't that be fun?
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font> wwwaddic7edcom
We're running tests for gunshot residue and cocaine
Should have those in, like, five minutes
Okay Good
Oh, Charlotte
You're still here, huh?
Well, he was my client
I thought I might be of help to the case
But if not, we could always get her to shoo along
and we can carry on with our business
No I'm sure she could be very helpful
So tell me, why does Zeke Moore,
a manager at an import/export company,
have you representing him?
- Because I'm the best - At getting criminals off
Well, that's not true
I haven't slept with any of my clients
What?
You represent the worst of the worst
So why was Zeke a client?
Because he works for Bianca Ruiz
What? The tequila magnate?
Bianca's tequila empire is a front
She uses the distribution routes to sell guns, drugs,
and, oh, yeah, people
So we've been after her for a long time
Who do you think did this?
A rival of some sort?
Well, that's actually a good question
Ella, what do we have?
Well, no smoking gun,
but poor Zeke here got shot twice
First in the thigh
bullet winged him and then another
went through his hand hitting him in the chest
Probably trying to defend himself
Too bad you can't catch bullets
Well, he can't maybe
I don't think this was a professional hit
Maybe a robbery gone wrong
And idea of what was taken?
Well, trace elements point to cash,
cocaine, gunpowder residue, indicating weapons
all your basic bad guy stuff
No sign of forced entry, though
Which means the killer either knew the combination,
or he just waited for the vic to open it to strike
Mm-hmm
Hey, I got something here
Cell phone
No dust on it, so it hasn't been there long
Well, Zeke had his phone on him,
so this one could be the killer's
Maybe he dropped it during the fight
or just didn't have time to retrieve it
Passcode protected, of course
But the home screen is two eyes?
Human female breasts
No That is a woman's perfectly freckled rump
So our lead on the killer
is a pair of butt-boob-eyes
It's a great start
Hello, Daniel
What are you doing here?
Ms Ruiz there
is my client
Well, she's a real piece of work
Trying to make me jealous?
What do you want from me?
You seduce me, you betray me, now you're back
You have to want something, I just can't figure out what
I do want something, you're right
And I'll tell you
Just somewhere private
I'm not having sex with you here
But I need something to pass the time until we get a lead
I don't understand you
All right, whatever this is between us
Well, it's simple, Daniel Espinoza
I like you
- Previously on Lucifer - I wasn't lying
I do intend to use the Flaming Sword
to cut through the Gates of Heaven
But what you left out?
I plan on kicking Mum into Heaven
and slamming the gates on her backside
- Maybe there's another piece missing - If you find the killer,
then you'll find our piece of the Flaming Sword
I went through a lot this last year,
and improv sort of helped me reorient myself
Amenadiel told you about our trip
back to Heaven, didn't he?
You should have told me
As promised This opens a safety deposit box
LAPD Bianca Ruiz, you're under arrest
Are you certain this is all that was in the safety deposit box?
We'll fix it There's plenty of time
Just not for me
God shattered the Flaming Sword into three distinct pieces
The Blade of Death, the Medallion of Life
and the Key that binds them all together
Look down
He entrusted it to you
Congrats on nabbing Queen Tequila
Well, Chet's still out there,
so this isn't over
I need what Zeke really smuggled
My life is ruined!
Ow
Hello?
It's Charlotte Richards
I need a favor
Would you look at that, Luci?
It really is the final piece
Unbelievable
Oh, no, I believe it
It's classic Dad
Hanging the final piece of the Flaming Sword
right under our noses Well
your nose,
this entire time
I know, right?
It's ridiculous
I mean, if that isn't the biggest celestial bird
Dad's ever flipped
What are you talking about?
This means that I'm the favorite son
Uh, no, it means that once again
Dad is manipulating us six ways to Sunday
But, hey, what's new?
At least we have it now
So
Well, hand it over, Brother
The sword's not gonna ignite itself
It oh, just give it to me
Give it to me Right, don't be silly, Brother
You know I'm ten times stronger than you
But I'm the favorite
Oh, right Of course
That one
Right, don't make me hurt you
Remember, you're not the angel you once were
No, Luci, you're right, I'm not
Well, oh
I didn't mean to make you all broody again
No, it's okay
I just need a little time to process what it all means
Process?
Okay Fine
Suppose we're in no real rush
Process away
I think I've got ET on the DVR
if you need a good weep
and a pint of Haagen-Daz in the freezer if that helps
You scared me God!
Goddess
But whatever
I need medical attention
I'm wounded
Then go to a hospital
This isn't exactly a human injury,
and since you know who,
or rather what I am,
I would appreciate it if you would just patch me up
Why does everybody keep doing this to me?
I am a doctor,
but patching people up isn't my thing
Oh
It is now
Suppose I could take a gander
Wonderful
I should warn you, you might have to
- duck - What?!
Who did that to you?
I mean, was it Lucifer?
I-I mean
not on purpose, you know
Accidentally, like with that
Flaming Sword thingy
All right, let me see what I got here
Okay, duct tape
Trust me
This stuff's amazing
This is ridiculous
You have experience
with emotionally fragile men, don't you?
You're self-aware today
No, I meant Dan
Anyway, tell me,
how do you stop them from overthinking everything?
Who's overthinking?
Amenadiel
Leave it to him to turn a compliment
into something to angst over
I mean, he should be happy he's Dad's favorite
Wait, your dad didn't actually tell you guys that, did he?
Well, in so many Sumerian words, yes
You know, the more I hear about your dad,
the more I understand why you're
you know, you
Body dump
Weird one, too, and not just 'cause of the obvious
buck naked, deep-fried head thing
But someone also shaved this poor guy's entire body
Well, maybe our poor killer's just chaetophobic
Fear of hair
Always fun when they turn up in Hell
Lots of wigs involved
But I'm pretty sure
this guy got a bath in bleach
So, whoever dumped him is a pro
It's like he just vanished off the face of the Earth
I know
But it's pretty tough for someone to cover every track
If anyone can find something, it's you, Ella
Aw, that is so sweet!
Yes, well, u-until you do,
I've got some personal business I need to tend to
'Cause, you know, you're not so much with the nice words,
but when they come out
- Doctor - Hi
Lucifer, what's up?
I'm wondering if you've seen Amenadiel
Nope
Haven't seen that family member No
Can you stop being weird and just let me in?
Mum
- What are you doing here? - Oh, you know,
girl stuff
Naked girl stuff?
Dr Linda, I had no idea
What is that?
All right, out with it, Mother
It's nothing
That spoiled brat,
Chet Ruiz, stabbed me,
and now I'm bleeding light
It's it's no big deal
What?
That's a huge deal
Mum, if your powers are returning to this degree,
then your human body won't be able to contain it, you'll
you'll burst
Oh, no
I need to find Amenadiel now
I'd rather you didn't
I mean, it's bad enough
- that you'll be worried - No, that's just it, Mum
Amenadiel has the missing piece of the sword
You're k you're kidding
Son, why didn't you say something?
Now we can finally ignite it and cut through the Gates of Heaven
and I can see my I can I can see my children
Yes Yes, but for now, I need to find Amenadiel
and you need to stay away from humans
You're a ticking bomb
Uh, um, actually,
speaking of that, I may have already
harmed someone
Oh, no
No, no, no
I just came from a crime scene The man with a burned head
Please tell me that isn't Chet
The detective is on that case
Well, not to worry I had a pro clean up the mess
You don't understand
The detective is good, annoyingly good
Well, then we just need to find Amenadiel, don't we?
- Yes - And get the piece
Because if we don't get you back to Heaven
before the detective gets to you,
then she is quite literally toast
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
Did you slip on a banana peel, too?
- What? - I'm afraid you're gonna need surgery
Don't fight it
The kid's fierce
I
So, I left Mum in the wine cellar at Lux,
and that's the situation
Ouch
Baby
I still don't get why you're here
Because I need the best bounty hunter out there
I can deal with the detective,
but I need you to find Amenadiel
Then we can get the pendant, assemble the sword
before Mum spews light everywhere
You don't have to speak in code
I can handle adult stuff
So what if your mother explodes?
Why should I care?
Because many, many humans could get hurt
Yeah, and?
Oh, nice try, Maze, but I happen to know
there's a few that you care about
Fine
But you pay me my standard fee
No freebies
Absolutely
Oh
Love me a lolli
Sorry, wussies don't get any
So, I ran the prints,
and it came back as your brother Chet
I'm sorry
I know that you've been
living in Mexico, but can you think of anyone
who may have wanted your brother dead?
My family had many enemies
It's why I left, to get away from
the Ruiz empire
I tried to get Chet to go with me, but
But, unfortunately, he got involved in the family business
I know you were the one who put my mother in prison
I also know you were after Chet,
so I know what you think of my family
But I loved my brother
He didn't deserve to die
Especially not like that
No one deserves to die like that
Look, I'm gonna work this case as carefully and fairly
as I would any other case
I promise you
Ah, oopsie daisy
There goes that clue Klutzy me
Aw, don't worry, buddy I am a total klutz myself
Which is why I always make a backup
Oh, good
Hope it leads us straight to Chet's killer
Oh, no,
that's from another crime scene
I got a big steaming pile of nada
from the Chet Ruiz crime scene
Oh, good
ness me, that is awful
Please tell me you have something
No, no, nothing It's so frustrating
Well, there is one thing I'm waiting on
But I thought you just said we had nada
Well, so the only thing we know for sure
is that someone had to drive there to dump the body
So, the tech team is checking the vicinity for cameras,
but it's such a remote place, so don't get your hopes up
Ooh, yes I think you're right, Miss Lopez
Sadly, the only witness to this one
is my dear old dad
Oh, right Yes, your dad
is always watching
Wait a second That gives me an idea
It does?
Satellite imaging takes sporadic photos of,
well, everything, so
So there may be footage of the killer
- going to or from the warehouse - Exactly
I mean, it's a long shot,
but thank you, Lucifer
You're so welcome
It's me God chose me
I'm the favorite son
This whole time, I actually thought
that God had lost faith in me, but it was me
I lost faith in him
I can see that now
That losing my powers must have been a test
And if so, I failed
I'm so sorry, Father
Yes, and how was your pork chop?
Okay, that's great We'll cut right there
Hey, can I have the lights please?
So, uh, good job
But there are a few subjects that we try to avoid:
you know, religion, politics, anything too polarizing
Okay?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm Totally understand
- I got this - Perfect
All right, let's give 'em another scenario
Oh, uh, zookeepers and the giraffe is pregnant
Okay
You guys ready?
Action
Oh, man!
I think she's going into labor!
Help me!
How can I help when I'm supposed to
kill my own father?!
And cut
It's a little dark, buddy
- Hmm - You know,
just try to have fun with it
But I thought you told me this helped you
work through difficult personal matters
I did
APB got a hit that it was parked in the lot across the street
I'm telling you, we're wasting time
It was the only vehicle parked
near the crime scene between midnight and 5:00 am
Yes, but how do you know this parked van's even the same one?
I mean, there's no license plates on this image
Oh, come on! How many vans have dandelions on the side?
They're not dandelions, they're jellyfish
What? Jellyfish?
Right, yes
Well, I'm simply saying that
we should be focusing on more pressing criminal issues
- Such as? - Well, I'm glad you asked, actually
The death of Celeste McDougall
Very suspicious, indeed
- She was 92 - Yes, and fit as a fiddle
- I mean, look at that smug face Look - I know
Yeah, I got it, I got it
LAPD!
Don't move!
You still think we're wasting our time?
Definitely rethinking the lasagna I had for lunch
Oh, my gosh
This is not what it looks like
What? Minions day out?
Take your hoods off, slowly
I know this looks bad, but we can explain
I'm Ava
This is my sister Kathleen
Hi How ya doin'?
Friendliest serial killers ever
Oh, that's hilarious We're not killers
God, no
We run Dandy Lyon Cleaners
Lyon's our last name Get it?
We take care of crime scenes, dead body removals
All the icky stuff
But totally legit
Yeah, like this poor guy, died of a heart attack
Like, two weeks ago
Right, well, perfectly good explanation
- I knew it Shall we, Detective? - Wait, wait, wait
Why was your van
outside of an abandoned warehouse in Eagle Rock
at 3:00 am last night?
I'm pretty sure you're mistaken
We were nowhere near that area
Well
Ugh, no Eagle Rock
Do not tell me you went to see Fred again
I thought you were done with that jerk
I was, till I ran into him at Jamba Juice
Understand completely
I mean, what's more intoxicating than a Mango-A-Go-Go?
Alibi sorted
We'll leave you here with Soupy, and we'll be on our way
- Come on - No Wait, wait Hold on
Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yes? - Enough with this
Why are you trying to rush our investigation?
Why are you still hiding things from me
after all we've been through?
You know I don't lie, Detective
But you also don't tell the whole truth
Does this have to do
with what you were upset about this morning,
with your family?
Yes, but I can't explain,
because you wouldn't understand
Not if you don't talk to me
Never mind
I thought we were past this
Going backwards, Lucifer, is not good
For anyone
Trust me, dude, you're gonna find this really freeing
once you get the hang of it
And I'll help you through it
Just takes practice
You're a good man, Daniel
Yeah
Ooh!
Okay
All right
Wow You're strong
That family is so weird
"You'll get the hang of it"
"It just takes practice"
And that hug
You guys doing it?
So, what are you even doing here?
I'm bounty hunting you, thanks to Lucifer
Time to assemble the sword, Amenadiel
I don't know that I want to, Maze
Father entrusted me with the final piece
That changes things
- Are you coming with me or not? - Think about it, Mazikeen
All of my actions, all of my feelings,
they were all just based on lies
You see, I thought I had fallen, and I
I don't get paid by the hour
Oh, my God! Are you going to Paris?
Can I be your travel buddy?
I love Paris
Les hommes, oh, très sexy, romantiques, avec
This is the Paris hotel in Vegas, actually
Oh
Not going there
Vegas and me
not pretty
Yeah, I'm not going, either
But Kathleen Lyon's ex
Brad did, and according to his Wobble page,
he's been partying there all weekend
Oh, well, that blows up
Kathleen's reason for being in Eagle Rock at 3:00 am
You think our two sweet, "legit" cleaners
are up to something not so legit?
Hello, Brother
I notice you've changed your look
Where's your pretty necklace?
Oh, I've put it in a safe place
Ah Keister it, did you?
Nope Already checked
Not there
Lovely
Listen, Amenadiel,
I need the final piece
Right So you and Mom can slice through the Gates of Heaven
and destroy Father
Yeah I know
Right
Maze, darling, would you mind
running down to the wine cellar and fetching Mum?
I think she'd like to hear this
I've been thinking about this, deeply
And I think that we've been looking at things the wrong way
Oh?
That necklace was a gift
It's not some manipulation
Well, you only think that because it was gifted to you
No, no, Luci!
It's all about perspective
Father doesn't always make things clear,
because he wants us to form our own beliefs
And I strongly believe that I am to guard that piece
Now, I may have lost my way,
but that doesn't mean that I can't rectify things now
Fine
What if I was to tell you
I never planned on destroying Dad?
- I'd say you were full of it - Yes, I want to assemble the sword,
yes, I want to cut through the gates, blah, blah,
but then I was just gonna kick Mum into Heaven
and slam the gates behind her
Let the two lovebirds torture each other for eternity
- And that's better? - Yes
No!
Regardless of whether you're with Mom or not,
I simply can't let Mom loose on Dad
Now, it is finally time that I go back
to being the loyal soldier that he entrusted me to be
Mom is not going anywhere!
Well, I am afraid that we do not have a choice, Brother!
Mum's powers are returning,
and it won't be long before we can't contain them
I mean, she's already killed one person,
and now the detective is on a
the detective is on her case
So, please, no discussion
Mum has to go!
She already has
Your mother's gone
What?
It's Cheval something or other
It's valuable, so it must be good
I wasn't expecting to see you
or your
deadly light back so soon
Well, something's been bothering me
When you first saw my wound
you asked if Lucifer had done it
What did you mean by that?
I meant nothing by it
You know?
Meaningless brain fart, you know?
Just blah Came out
There was a lot going on that day
Hmm
I don't think so
I think, in fact,
that you know something
I don't want to hurt you, Linda
I am running
out of time
You've seen what's happening to me
So you can either tell me what you know
over a glass of wine
or over your own charbroiled corpse
Your choice
I came here to grill Kathleen on the false alibi
Whoa Somebody already had, huh?
Yeah
It's Ava Lyon
I'm thinking whoever killed Chet
hired the Lyon sisters to clean up,
then cleaned up the cleaner
Excuse me, what is going on?
I work here
Ava!
Stop
Oh, my God
What did I do?
It's me, only me
Ava knew nothing about it
I wasn't lying about Brad
I did get back together with him,
but he gambles a lot, and he needed money
Then I got this call offering me a hundred grand
Who hired you?
Who killed Chet and your sister?
Maybe Ava's death was a warning
For me to keep my mouth shut
Maybe if I don't say anything
So how do we find Mom?
Follow the trail of roasted humans?
Well, if anyone can find that wily goddess, it's Maze
She's on it
Detective Everything all right?
We found a body
- Another body? - A burned head
- Same burned head? - Yes
So, what, you think whoever killed Chet killed again?
Look, Lucifer, it's a long story,
but the second victim is Ava Lyon
She's one of the cleaners we met
I have her sister Kathleen here,
but she's not saying anything She's scared
So I need you to come here,
and I need you to do your mojo thing
Yes, Detective, believe me when I say
I want to find the killer as much as you do
Hello, boys
Mum
What? What? What's going on?
I-I'm so sorry My mum's here
I-I've got to rush
Good luck with Kathleen Ciao
Damn it
- What's wrong? - Lucifer
He's
He's hiding something from me, I can tell
Oh, you know what? It's probably just embarrassing family stuff
I mean, they seem totally bonkers
Yeah
Maybe
He is with his step-mom now, so
So maybe
maybe he's not hiding something from me,
but someone
Someone who knew Chet
And someone I still don't trust
What have you been doing?
Oh this and that
This being firing up the celestial barbecue
so that you can grill another head?
No I just needed to get cleaned up
Get some air
I was feeling a little claustrophobic
Don't you just hate being kept in the dark?
The good news is you found Amenadiel
So we have the piece?
Yes Well, interesting story, actually
Why don't you tell her, Brother?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no This one's all you
Brother, I insist
Thank you
Right Well, uh,
upon careful consideration,
we've decided this whole Flaming Sword plan
is a crap idea
Yes, crap
Mm Have you ever considered
finding, well, I don't know,
a-a place of your own?
Yeah Somewhere away from Dad, maybe?
Yes
Somewhere familiar,
warmer, perhaps?
You want you want me back in Hell?
Well, not in Hell, per se,
but in charge of Hell
I mean, after all, it is a kingdom
without a ruler
He is right
I mean, there's a great opportunity for upward mobility
Lick of paint here or there
The columns would look great in white
Beige?
So it's true
You are working against me
You never planned on going with me to Heaven
Wait
How did you find out?
Well, I persuaded
your little doctor
I'm sorry I had no choice
What did you do?
Mum
Mom
Listen, I understand
You're angry
Oh, I'm not angry
Just disappointed
Give me the piece!
No, Mom
You're gonna have to kill me
Guess I'll have to find another way, won't I?
Well, now look what you've made her do
I've just had this tuned!
Me? How about you suggesting Hell
as a retirement home? Nice
Maybe if you had just
mentioned the pottery class
or water aerobics, she would have gone for it
Oh, and did you have a better idea?
Mom's coming undone, Luci
- In every way - I know
And she doesn't care who she hurts anymore
Linda
I'll go check on Linda
You go after Mom, she'll listen to you
But, Luci, don't you dare promise her that piece,
because I won't give it to her
Well, well Someone's clever
How did you get me?
Wasn't that hard We tracked your phone
No, I mean, how did you figure out I was the bad guy?
Did Little Miss Dandy Lyon tell you?
It's over, Charlotte Put your hands up
Oh, don't worry, I'm not going to resist
I'll tell you everything you want to know
I just have one small request
Detective
Any chance you've seen my Mu
Looking for little ol' me?
You were right, dear
Your detective is quite good
She caught me
Where are you?
Santa Monica Pier
Such a beautiful place
So many people
If you hurt anyone, Mum,
if you hurt her
And if you and your brother had just given me what I needed
But who knows?
Maybe you still can
Okay, that's enough
Mum!
Start talking
Just the two of us
If that's all right
I'd rather not put Daniel in
an awkward position
Hate to ruin all the good ones we've been in
Can we go outside?
Mm-hmm
I'll be fine
I'll miss you, Daniel
You are my favorite human
Hey You find Mom?
She's on Santa Monica Pier, and she wants the piece
We have to give it to her, Amenadiel
We've run out of options
Please
Brother, please
She she has Chloe
Linda! You here?!
I'm tracking Lucifer's mom,
and I think she might be on her way
Oh, no
No, no, no!
Linda
Hey It's okay
I'm here Okay?
You're gonna be fine
She did this to you, didn't she?
She wanted to know what Lucifer's plans were
I didn't want to tell her
I tried to resist I'm so sorry
It's not your fault, okay?
And you're going to be fine
I promise
I'm-I'm gonna fix you
Okay?
Help me
Hello, Daniel
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
She kissed me
Literally no idea what you're talking about
Just get your hands up
No, don't be silly
I'm not gonna stab you
I'm just looking for something
Come on, up Up!
What are you looking for?
Uh
- Hello - Whoa
What the?
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Ah
Ah-ah-ah It's my brother's
He left it there for safekeeping, so thanks for that
You're a lifesaver
Okay, Charlotte, this has been a great chat,
but are you gonna confess or what?
I'll never understand why you concern yourselves
with one little human, but fine
Yes, I was involved in Chet's death,
but not in the way you think
Well, correct me if I'm wrong You killed him
You hired a cleaner to take care of the body
And then you killed the cleaner
Is that it?
The cleaner's dead?
What?
Oh, that's unfortunate
I certainly had nothing to do with that
But if you didn't, then who did?
Mom!
I've got it
Now let the detective go
Lucifer,
put down the knife
You can't protect your mother anymore
I'm not protecting her
It's you I'm trying to save
Now, here it is, Mum
I have the blade and the final piece
You let the detective go, and they are yours
Let me go? Really?
I'm the one holding her
- Mum? - No one's going anywhere!
Oh, I think we found our mystery killer
How can you be so glib?!
You were our lawyer!
You betrayed us!
Put the gun down, Hector
Thank you for leading me to her, Detective
You promised to approach this fairly, and you did
But now I have to make things right for my family
Ah!
A little wrinkle
You shoot her
and we're all dead, okay?
I need a hospital
Yes
Okay
It's too far, Maze
She won't make it
We need to do something
We need more time
We just need more time
What are you doing?
Look, it's very difficult to explain,
but believe me when I say
that there are many, many lives at stake here
So, please, just put the gun down, huh?
No!
Amenadiel
You son of a bitch
How?
Go
I'm sorry, Mum
But I'm afraid that this ends now
You've hurt so many people, Mum It has to stop
You know that everything I've done, I've done for, for us,
for our family
You used me
Used Chloe
Me?
What about your father?
He created Chloe just to manipulate you
Lucifer, look
We have the sword
Finally, finally, we can get revenge
We can destroy him
We can take our home back
I'm not leaving, Mum!
Okay
I can take care of it for both of us
Just give me the sword, and I'll do the rest
Please, son I just
I just want a chance to start over
But going home?
That's not starting over, that's
that's going backwards
And that's not good for anyone
So it's time for you to move forward, Mum
Even if it means I'll never see you again
Lucifer
No!
Bloody hell, it worked
I guess it can cut through anything, even the world itself
What is that?
It's-it's nothing
At least, for now
This is the real way to move forward, Mum
To create a whole new world, your own world, without Father
But what about you?
Amenadiel? My children?
You know that if we go back to Heaven,
then there will be a war
And in war,
there are always casualties
The last thing I want is to hurt my children
I know
So, please,
let there be light
My angel
I will miss you
so much
Hey
I'm sorry, Daniel She didn't
die
Mum?
"Mom"?
My kids are ten
Right, of course
Charlotte
What's what's going on?
Uh, why am I at the beach?
You fell off the pier
I fell off the?
It's-it's okay I got you
Who are you?
So what do you think will happen to Charlotte?
Well, given her law firm's track record, probably not much
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think
that Hector killed both victims
What, you think he killed his own brother?
I think you would be the first to agree
You know, things between families can get pretty heated
Yes Heated
Oh, and Ella found a Mondo blowtorch in Hector's car,
- so there's that - Right
The only thing I still don't understand is
you seemed to have some inkling of this
from the very beginning, so
why didn't you let me in on it?
Well, you
'Cause at this point, you either trust me or you don't
Detective, I trust you
Look, if you think that I wouldn't forgive you
for your mistakes or your flaws,
if you think that I don't know who you really are by now,
you're wrong
Linda, look at you
Lucifer
I'm okay
This is my fault
I-I should never have got you involved
in any of this from the start
It's not like I didn't know I was dealing
with the most powerful, well
the most dysfunctional family
in the universe
Lucifer
I walked into this with my eyes wide open,
chose to be your friend
and face all that comes with that
The good,
the bad and the crispy
What?
I just realized something that I need to do
But let's focus on you, shall we?
That's enough about me
Detective Hello, it's me
Lucifer
Um, I just wanted to apologize
for being, well, for being so elusive
But I also wanted to say that I am done hiding
So I'm coming over now to tell you the truth about me
'Cause I think it's time I finally opened your eyes
as to why strange things sometimes happen around me
Why my brother's so saintly and Maze is so not
And I'm so well, magnetic
No, but s-seriously, I
I want to tell you everything
No more going backwards

- Previously on Lucifer - So, you are the Devil, 
and you've left Hell behind
to take a vacation in Los Angeles
Well, where else would I go?
I got it I got it The name
The whole Lucifer thing
And desire's, like, your superpower
Mm, it's more like a gift from God, really
My God Your dad did that to you?
No, that's where I cut my wings off
Mum's powers are returning,
and it won't be long before we can't contain them
I'm afraid that this ends now
Bloody hell, it worked!
- Who are you? - I should never have
got you involved in any of this from the start
I just realized something that I need to do
Detective,
I'm coming over now
to tell you the truth about me
Are you blind?
The day I've had, I tell you
Right I'd like a ride to Los Angeles, please
I oh
Dearie me
At least I'm healing fast
Do you have any aloe vera?
I ain't going back to LA
What
Hold on, you're not a real armored truck driver, are you?
Wait
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Oh, yes, yes
You're that jewelry thief,
the one who left in nothing but his manties
You!
You got me put in jail!
Uh, well, I think that one's on you, sir
I wasn't the one with the gun and the ski mask
I'm not gonna let you screw this up for me again
It's time for you to go
Well, you are a tenacious one,
I'll give you that
Respect
You one crazy-ass bitch
Now, get out of the truck
Now
Look
I know you don't want to shoot me, Mr
What's your name?
- Said out, bitch - Mr Said Out Bitch, tell me,
what is it you really desire?
I just want to get out of here, man
Right, freedom, of course
That hasn't changed
Well, then we might be able to help each other
Suspect heading towards us
Prepare the blockade
I can't see though
- Eyes on - Easy, easy
Don't move!
Hello, there
Hands in the air!
That won't be necessary
I'm Lucifer Morningstar,
consultant for the LAPD
I've apprehended this stolen vehicle
and all of its contents
- You're welcome - Hands up!
- Down on the ground! - Well, I'd really rather not
I've just got into some clean clothes
Partner name and badge number!
Oh, for goodness' sake Detective Decker
I'm afraid I don't know her badge number
- Detective Decker - But I'd say with certainty
she's a 34-B, if that helps
Hot as hell out here, isn't it?
Well, close, anyway
- Checks out - Well, of course
it does I'm never wrong when it comes to cup size
Okay
Hold on! What'd you do with the real thief?
Well, unfortunately,
he got away
But not to worry
I don't think he'll be bothering you
for a very, very long time
Ah Good
You're here
Well, I wasn't sure what you fancied, so I ordered
a little of everything
Thank you, Benjamin
Lucifer, what is all of this?
This is your new wellness regime
I thought since I was responsible
for your current state, the least I could do is heal you
And yes, Benjamin is part of the package
He'll be back after dark
Oh, well, don't worry, he'll be gentle
Mm
What? I just want to take care of you
Is that so hard to believe?
Yes Out with it
What's going on?
Talk about insult to injury
I-I-I didn't know that they could grow back
Are wings
like body hair?
No Don't be so ridiculous
This is Dad's latest stunt
A celestial spanking, if you will
I suppose that's what I get for giving Mum her own universe
Holy crap!
Exactly
Mm But it's no biggie
I cut them off once, and I can cut them off again
Now, I'd have Maze do it, but she's off
bounty hunting again, and
well, I thought, what, with your medical expertise
- and training - Even if I was
that kind of doctor, I'm pretty sure
they're not teaching wing-ectomies in med school
No, no, no,
it's quite simple it's just snip, snip, and Bob's your uncle
Well, God's your Father, Lucifer
And things are never simple with Him
You don't know why for sure your wings have returned
They've returned
because Dad is a control freak
He's pissed off that He can't get Mum back,
so He stuck my wings back on
But I am not His Mr Potato Head
And don't worry, I fully plan to track down Dad's emissary
on Earth, and give him a return message But for now
Emissary? You think God sent someone to do this to you?
Never mind all that
Right now I need you to help me
So come on, chop-chop
No
As your therapist, I'm sorry,
but I can't do this
- Well, as a friend, then - Yes, as a friend
who got caught in the cross fire, I beg you, please,
think this through before you do something rash
I
I almost died because of your family drama
Right
But you can definitely text me Ben's number, though
Okay
Oh, gosh, it's hard enough just to scratch your own back
Right, it's okay, it's okay, you can call off the search party
I'm unharmed
'Sup, wimp?
Detective, Detective, I am so sorry
You must have been so worried in my absence
Your absence? I saw you two days ago
I thought you were just avoiding meeting the new lieutenant
New who? Never mind, I don't care
We've got something much more important we need to discuss
Oh, is this about the message you left?
Message? Oh, right
Uh, well, we will talk about that later,
but right now we need to figure out who kidnapped me
Kidnapped you?
Okay, I'll play Who kidnapped you?
I don't know
Well, what did they look like?
I don't know
L-L-Look,
I'm fairly certain that my Father's behind it
Your father kidnapped you?
Well, no, not Him personally
God never gets His own hands dirty, does He?
Uh-huh
You don't believe me
Uh-huh Sorry
This is just a little far-fetched, even for you Right
- Okay, fine - Mm-hmm
I'll take you to the scene of the crime
Come on Come on!
Yes, I'm sure
It's just past this shrub
Well, I don't see anything
What? I
Ah! Ha-ha! Footprints
Those are mine
Oh Well
well, then the wind must have blown
the crime scene bare, Detective,
because I am not lying
Someone kidnapped me I was outside the hospital,
leaving you a message, and someone stashed me
So this was about that message
Look, Lucifer,
if you regret what you said, if this kidnapping tale
is some elaborate distraction, you can just stop
All right? You don't need to tell me anything
- I'm no stranger to the drunken dial - Yes, I have been known
to avoid the issue at times, but that is not the case here
Detective, I swear, this is the scene of a despicable crime
What?
I
I believe you
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy - - wwwaddic7edcom -
Soaked in sweat, parched and starving,
he scraped, clawed his way towards the light,
but, ironically,
the only thing stronger than his desperate desire
to live was
the sun its relentless heat
literally cooking him, until one last
breath
and he's gone
Tragic But, now, can we please get on with it?
Whoever killed this dehydrated sap
is clearly responsible for my devil-napping
I mean, the location's far too coincidental
Who is he, and what does he
- have to do with me? - Steve Banales
Owner and CEO of Angelette Hotel
Steve Banales That's strange
Never heard of him
You'd think we'd have some kind of connection
I suppose we'll get more answers once we find our assailant
Hey, Jerry I think I found some footprints
What?
No, those are mine
Amateurs
How did we get stuck with the "B" team, anyway?
Lucifer, this is Lancaster PD
The crime scene is on the LA border,
so they're here helping
I mean, I think they're doing a great job
Geez These Lancaster guys are a bunch of tools
Oh
Speaking of tools, whoa, whoa
Whoa, hey, Detective? Detective?
- So, what'd you find? - Looks like a key chain
Hey, guys, look at this
Finally A clue
An "A"?
- Right Off we go, Ms Lopez - Oh, uh,
hold up, bud I need to do one more lap of the scene
Want to make sure we didn't miss anything
I mean, not that I don't trust Lancaster
I just don't want to disappoint our new lieutenant
Oh, my gosh, you guys, did I tell you
that I saw Lieutenant Pierce speak at a conference last year?
"The Red Tape Beyond the Yellow Tape"
Riveting
- Sounds it - Yeah, you told us
Yup, you did
Anyway, big fan
The guy is a serious rock star
I can't believe he transferred here
We are so lucky
And I hear he's a total sweetie pants to boot
I'm Lieutenant Marcus Pierce
All right, back to it
Uh, Detective Daniel Espinoza
Heard a lot about you, Lieutenant,
and I'm really excited to work with you
I wish I could say the same
Aren't you that corrupt cop that got off easy?
Excuse me?
No Excuse me
You must be Lucifer
Morningstar Pleasure
There was an investigation last year
We interviewed what was it 92 of your sexual partners?
I think I'll refrain from physical contact
if you don't mind
You don't seem reckless
Narcissistic, hedonistic that I see
Well, thank you very much
Not a compliment Your file is as long as my Johnson
Oh Quick read then?
- Hardly - Well, I, for one,
don't need a file to ascertain
you haven't even had a snog in ages, have you?
Accurate
Okay!
Hi I am Detective Decker
Lucifer's partner I know
Actually, he's mine
Uh, uh, consultant, to be exact
- That's what I said - But, uh
Well?
Isn't he amazing?
We just had the best conversation
over the doughnuts I brought for him
everyone, not just him I'm not
kissing ass or anything Mm-hmm
Doughnuts for everyone! Doughnuts!
- Right - Wow
- Wow - Lucifer
I've been looking all over for you
Uh, through here Go
So what happened?
It was terrible, Brother
I was kidnapped
No, Luci I meant Mom
Ah Well, didn't you get my text?
What? You mean the string of nonsensical emojis?
Fire, sword, doughnut, spaceman,
clock, dancing lady, flashlight, thumbs up
How am I supposed to know what that means?
I ignited the flaming sword,
used it to cut a hole in space and time,
Mum's light flooded through it,
then it closed up behind her All good!
Mom's Mom is gone?
Yes
Yes I mean, she says good-bye forever,
she loves you very much, et cetera, et cetera, but
the good news is
you get your necklace back
And we all know how attached to that you are
So, back to more current issues
Me and my kidnapping
Now, clearly Dad is behind it,
but the question is, who's his emissary,
and how were they able to render me unconscious?
Either they used some kind of celestial weapon,
or the detective was nearby
And if it's the latter, then it has
to be someone who knows she makes me vulnerable
Hang on
The "A" on the key chain is for Amenadiel, isn't it?
- What? - Of course
It's you! Now that God's favorite son's
regained his powers, he's back to being his little bitch
Luci, I didn't get my powers back
Yes, I was able to slow time, but
uh, that appears to have been a one-time thing
But you have got your wings back, huh?
No
Not yet
Well, isn't that ironic?
You want your wings back and didn't get them, and
I
get whacked over the head and hauled out to the desert
That's not ironic
Well, not ironic ironic
More Alanis Morissette ironic
Anyway, the point is,
I'm sure your full powers will come back in no time
You probably just need a good nap
Or eat some mangos I've heard they work wonders
- What? - We got a suspect
Prints on the key chain
First, it looked like it had been wiped down
Then, I whipped out the color fluorescent film, and whammo
- Well done, Miss Lopez - Mm-hmm
Oh, sorry We haven't officially met yet
I'm Ella
- Amenadiel - I mean,
I've seen you around, doing your handsome broody thing, but
Anyway, any bro of Lucifer's is a bro of mine
Whoa
Someone works out
Now I know who carries
- the guns in the family - Right, yes
Enough of that We have a suspect Shall we?
Oh, Brother?
About your problem Yeah
I think I might have just the remedy
I'll text you the info later
Words this time, please!
Josh Hamid, the victim's business partner
The two own this hotel
Well, this is a mug shot
Has he got a record?
Yeah Possession of an exotic animal
A tiger, I think
Oh, that's illegal? Too bad
Yeah, anyhow, looks like
Josh and Steve both come from family money
Basically bought this hotel just to have a place to party
Imagine, buying your own establishment
just to justify your decadent lifestyle
It's absurd
Yeah Absurd
Thank you
Josh Hamid?
Who wants to know?
Detective Decker, LAPD
I imagine you recognize me
You got a nice set of cans for a cop
Right Whilst I don't disagree,
that is incredibly disrespectful
Perhaps I should teach you some manners
Lucifer, I got this
Got a nice ass, too
Yeah? Well, I also got these,
and your sorry ass is a suspect in the Steve Banales murder
I told you Steve was up to something
You want to cuff me, honey?
You're gonna have to catch me
Excuse me
Oh, you've got a gun
Scary
Hey, you tell Steve I am officially impressed
You think this is funny?!
Lucifer!
Well, maybe it's a bit funny
So, Josh
Why did you kidnap me?!
I swear, I've never seen you
before you tried to kill me today!
Really, Joshy
Excuse us
What?
- What are you doing? - Consulting
Then consult less
So you say you don't recognize Lucifer,
but you do admit to knowing Steve Banales, correct?
Then did you do this to him?
This is a joke, right?
We found this at the crime scene
with your fingerprints all over it
I didn't kill Steve, man! I would never!
That's the key I gave to the fake kidnappers
- Fake? - Yeah
They get paid to abduct people
I hired them for Steve
- It's our thing - What?
- To torture each other? - No! To pull pranks
The more money we made, the crazier the prank
The fake kidnapping was retaliation
for the tiger Steve put in my backyard
What's the name of the company?
Snatched
Super under the radar
I-I got the deluxe package
Ah Well, they delivered
They were supposed to nab Steve for 48 hours,
tie him up in a warehouse,
stick him in the desert, and then drop him back
at the hotel When he didn't show,
I just assumed he was busy planning payback
It's why I thought you weren't real cops
I mean, a guy named Lucifer and the chick from Hot Tub Hotel?
- High School - Hot Tub High School
She wasn't in the sequel
I'm sorry Anyway, can you blame me?
Look, here's the thing, Joshy
I can assure you we are quite real,
and by the looks of it, so are your kidnappers,
so tell us what you know about this Snatched
All right, Luci, I got your text
What's this magical remedy of yours?
Hi I'm Remedy
I'm here to rub you
Uh, give you a massage
Oh
Well, why not?
Lovely Um, please remove your clothing
and get under the towel
We're gonna need a bigger towel
I know where they are
I'll be right back
Oh, man I searched the IP address,
like, a zillion times and it keeps pinging
to some random Russian server
Surely there's some other way to track these miscreants
Something we missed at the crime scene perhaps?
I wish All we found there was that key chain
and our second victim
- Wait Second victim? - Leo
Once a vibrant rock squirrel
Now roadkill
Judging from his time of death,
about 16 hours before Steve died of dehydration
It's pretty likely the kidnappers
are the ones who ran him over Mmhmm
Poor guy never even saw it coming
So, did you lift any tire treads?
Sure did
Leo was squashed by a Ryuk Road Crusher tire
Commercial grade
Only 850,000 sets produced
- In the world? - Nope
- In LA - Oh, for goodness' sakes
You know, there still is one angle
that we haven't quite explored yet
And that is your connection to the case
Oh, and I wasn't sure you thought there was one
Well, I'm still not sure I do, but we're stuck,
so do you think your kidnapping was intended as a prank?
Or to actually hurt you, like Steve?
Definitely the latter
My Father is not a jokester
Right
Right So, say your father
did hire these fake kidnappers
- He did - to
- Hmm - Any idea why?
Of course He's angry that I gave Mum her own universe
I mean, nothing pisses God off more than exercising free will
- I am trying to believe you here - Something horrid
happened to me and I woke up in the desert with my bloody
wi
What?
Okay, Detective I understand your confusion
And, although I've told you the truth from the beginning,
you're a woman of logic and reason
And that-that is why I left you that message
You require proof
And I suppose now is as good a time as any to give it to you
So perhaps you should sit
Okay
Mm-hmm
Oh, right
Yeah Maybe I should leave
You know, uh, third wheel
Watch out
Okay
Lucifer, just show me what you need to show me
You know, I don't need anything to drink
Well, I do
I have tried to be honest with you,
but if I'm being honest with myself,
and I have held the real truth back from you,
and you, of all people, deserve to know that, Detective
Which is why I want to show you
Lucifer, whatever it is
that you want to show me
or that you want to tell me, it's okay
I'm here for you
Okay
Then, once and for all,
I'd like to show you who I really am
Okay
You ready?
Yeah
Oh, my God What? Are you gassy?
Why is it not working?
Why isn't what working?
What? I don't understand
I do
You know, I keep caring,
and you you just
Just
No, Detective! I
I
really am the Devil
Well, that sucks
Dead ends piss me off
Which is why I don't believe in them
Now, these kidnappers might be fake but they're not invisible
There has to be a way to find them
You're right
If Muhammad won't come to the mountain,
the mountain must go to Muhammad
I have no idea what that means, Decker
Well, someone needs to get kidnapped
Now, there's an idea
That I was just suggesting
No one likes a credit hog, Decker
Now, who would be the bait?
Well, I'd like to volunteer
Uh, it's not a good idea
If these are the same guys that abducted,
allegedly, Lucifer, they're gonna recognize him
Right We need somebody who's a lot less, well
everything
Esperanza
Es-Espinoza
And, sure, that makes, uh, makes sense
I have the most experience in the field,
so if something goes wrong, then
You're expendable
Exactly
Thank you
Now go get kidnapped, Esperanza
Hey, excuse me, I was wondering if I could get a
We're closed
We ran out of meat
All right, Daniel
You're not allergic to gerbils, are you?
Just making some last-minute adjustments
to the questionnaire
Hilarious
Hey, Lucifer, did you set up the pickup point?
Yes Tour bus pickup
Olvera Street
Exactly one half hour from now
All right, good
Hey You know the team
will intervene before anyone gets hurt, yeah?
Yeah
Okay
Look, if you're upset about what the lieutenant said,
you're not alone
He's not a fan of mine, either
And I still can't believe he called me "Lucifer's partner"
You are my partner!
You know, the truth is, I am feeling expendable
- Why? - It's not because Pierce said it
It's because of Charlotte
Oh
Yeah, after everything that happened at the beach,
she's acting like she doesn't even know me
I'm not an idiot, I know she was using me at first,
but but then it seemed like she actually cared
Well, um Whatever
I'll get over it
I'm sorry, Dan
Yes, I'm sorry, too, Daniel,
that I can't hear you Could you speak up, please?
T minus 20, people
Take your mark, Espinoza
Right, I'll check in with McMillian at the lookout point
Okay
Uh, Daniel
- Listen, uh - Come on
Oh, right Undercover, yes
Listen, I know you were talking about Charlotte
And as douchey as you may be, and I know you can't help it,
her current behavior has nothing to do with you, okay?
And as much as I appreciate the pep talk,
Lucifer, it was kinda you that got me
in the whole Charlotte mess in the first place
So maybe you should just
take care of your side of the street for a change, all right?
Good talk
My side of the street
That's a good idea
Leo?
Oh
Hey I'm sorry to bother you,
but do you have any idea where my brother went?
He's ignoring my phone calls
Oh, bud, no, no, no He's totally not ignoring you
He's just in the middle of this sting operation
Oh
Can I help?
That's very nice of you, but no
It's personal
You a believer?
Well, then, whatever it is you're going through,
I'm sure it's all part of His plan
I mean, even the most
pathetic, sad sack, powerless of creatures serve a purpose
Like Leo here
A van may have cracked his nuts in the middle of the desert,
but he's still valuable evidence
That's the thing You never know
when your rock-bottom pain and humiliation
can end up helping others
I mean, God works in mysterious ways
So you just got to believe that when He crushes your nuts,
He does it for a reason
Has this, um,
Leo provided you with a break in your case?
Not yet
But you got to have faith, right?
Right Right
The kidnappers are seven minutes late
Yeah, well, we didn't give them a lot of prep time; don't worry
I'm worried
Where are they?
They'll be here
Come on
Come on, be here Be here
Oh, lovely Right on time
Hello Right How do we do
Oh, careful I bruise like a peach
Easy
_
Seriously?
Ah, there you are
I have to say, the leaky pipe is a nice touch
Very Blood Simple
Coen Brothers movie?
No?
Oh
Well,
hello, kidnappers
Finally, I have you right where I want you
Let's see, so many questions,
how did you abduct me the first time?
Hmm? How did you render me unconscious?
Ow What are you doing?
Stop it, that tickles
We used this last week, right?
Yeah
Did you forget to charge it?
No I didn't forget to charge it
Dude
- Not cool - I just don't get it
I don't know I hate to interrupt
Where were we?
Remind me not to leave Lucifer in the front seat unattended
And remind me to kick his ass
for humiliating me in front of Pierce
Well, I'll help you if we can find him
Look
don't worry, Chloe
Lucifer can take care of himself
Found Lucifer's phone
in some bushes on Alameda Street
Kidnappers must have tossed it
What about, uh, traffic cams?
- Maybe we can pull a plate number - No
I checked everything within a mile radius Nada
Must have grabbed him in a blind spot
Unfortunately,
I think we're dealing with some pretty crafty bad guys
I
can't breathe!
Please don't crush him We've only just begun
No Come on, man Ask us anything!
All right
My face how did you do it?
What?! Well, the wings are one thing,
but my Devil face how did you take that?
We've never seen you before, man!
Yeah, man
Never heard of you before today
I just got a name Daniel LaDoosh a pickup point,
and that you got a thing for gerbils
I suppose you also deny abducting Mr Banales
and leaving him to perish in the desert, do you?
He's the client from last week, man!
Right, man
His friend got him the deluxe package
We did the detail work here,
and then our partner Sam picked him up,
took him to the spider hole for a few hours,
and dropped him back off at the hotel
Well, then,
it seems your colleague took a detour
Where does this Sam live?
Koreatown!
It's a pink building on Leeward
- Apartment? - 5B, man! 5B!
Lovely Thanks for your help
Hey, man!
Will you let us go, man?
So, prints off the key chain led to Josh
Right Tire treads on the roadkill led to nothing
There's got to be something we're missing
Maybe Lancaster has something
We're screwed
Or not
Remember the detective who found the key chain?
He doesn't exist, at least not at Lancaster PD
They only sent patrol units to the scene
Whoa You think that was our guy?
Killers often return to the scene of the crime
Which means
he wasn't finding evidence
He was trying to steal it
Should have known
Why should you have known?
Lancaster doesn't know us, we don't know them
Look, let's just look through these photos, try and find him
in the background, okay? -Yes, and then we can nail his ass
with facial recognition software
Here he is
But his back's to us
You guys oh, my gosh
I knew I knew he didn't die in vain
- What? - Who?
Leo See, look
There's our suspect, right, leaving the scene,
walking towards that van
Ryuk Road Crusher tires
Commercial grade
That's the van that ran over Leo
I mean, this pretty much confirms
- that this guy's our killer - Okay
So maybe we can get an ID
Let's run the license plate
Remember me?
It's you
Yes
You know me as the Devil you so rudely turned into an angel
and then dumped in the middle of the desert,
but I don't know you, so, come on,
introduce yourself
- I'm Sam - Yes, yes,
I know that, but what are you?
And how did my Father get his hooks into you?
Your father?
Oh, come on, don't be coy
Let me see
Unless Dad got jiggy with some celestial babe
after Mum, then you're not my sibling,
so demon Hmm?
Changeling?
I work for an extreme kidnapping company
Snatched
Oh, do you now? Well, do you know what?
It doesn't matter what you are because
this should take care of you
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! I I'm sorry
I'm sorry I left you in the desert
I really am
And I'm sorry I left that Steve guy there, too
I He was just a routine gig
I was gonna swap him for you,
but when I went to pull you out of the van,
you you had friggin' wings, man!
Well, duh! Wings that you put there
at the behest of my Father!
- Now stop lying! - I'm not!
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
I swear
And believe me, I didn't want to run,
but you scared the hell out of me
Right, you listen, Sammy,
I know you're just the messenger,
so why don't you deliver a message on my behalf?
I define who I am, not Him
Me!
Oh, bloody hell
They're back, aren't they?
How?
How are you doing this?
Did my Father give you some kind of totem?
A talisman?
- What? - I'm telling you, I don't
I don't know what's happening
And I don't know your dad
Unless, is your, is your dad the Sinnerman?
Quite the opposite Who's the Sinnerman?
That's, that's who,
who hired me to kidnap you
He's, he's, he's a scary dude
Huge crime boss I owed him big time
But because I didn't finish the job,
I'm as good as dead now
That's why I was running
And where do I find this Sinnerman?
You don't
He finds you
Lucifer?
Get up
Up
Come on, get up
Put your hands behind your back
- What happened to you? - I
I don't know
Decker, it ain't good
Lieutenant, look, I-I know what you're gonna say
And, even though we caught our guy,
Lucifer was way out of line, and I-I don't disagree,
but here's what you got to know
about our unorthodox methods
- Detective, you - I am Lucifer's partner,
yes, you're right, but you know what?
He's mine, too
And, for whatever reason, we make an effective team
And will be even more so when I stop investing
on a, um personal level
I am here to solve crimes
Not to see his his thing
or whatever, which is
not something that you need to know
Right Look, point is,
you can say what you want, but I know I'm a good detective
and I have a damn good solve rate to prove that
Okay
Okay
Okay
I just came down here
to let you know that your perp has been released on bail
Oh
W-Wait, how is that possible?
Don't know
Friends in high places, I guess
But there's got to be something
I mean, don't-don't you care?
You do what you can, Decker
You can't save them all
Oh
But, um, good luck with Lucifer's thing
or whatever
Oh, hello, Brother
So, did Remedy cure what ails you?
Did her massage make anything
pop out?
Talking about your wings, of course
No, mine are still absent
But yours, on the other hand
Oh
Lucifer, I'm not angry with you
that you somehow got your wings back,
or even that you cut them off again,
as foul as that may be
I'm angry with myself
Because somehow I made you feel
like you couldn't confide in me
Well, comparing body parts is never good for the male ego,
especially between brothers
But that's just it, Luci
My ego should never be an issue
I am an angel
A soldier of God
His favorite son
Oh, that's gonna be a thing, isn't it?
Listen, Father, He
works in mysterious ways
I was tested once and I failed
I'm not gonna fail again
Because this time, I have faith
Excellent
And I suppose this won't bother you
But you
you cut them off
I did, but the pesky things seem to be a bit more tenacious
this time around
Well, like I said, I have faith
I'm sure it's all a part of God's plan
Yes!
If you mean his plan to continually manipulate
and control me, then agreed
Because, by the way,
he didn't just give my wings back,
he took my Devil face as well
Luci, do you realize what this means?
Perhaps Father is trying to show you that,
that you've been forgiven
What if I don't want His forgiveness?
But, Brother, if you can be redeemed,
that means that anyone can
Now, isn't that divine?
I'm not sure that this is divinity at work here
Have you ever heard of someone named the Sinnerman?
The Sinnerman?
No
Why?
That's who kidnapped me
At first, I thought it was a
an emissary on Earth
working on Dad's behalf, but then, the more I think about it,
the more I think
maybe this isn't our Father who art in Heaven at all
But something much,
much darker

- Previously on Lucifer - MAZE: But I didn't 
leave Hell to be a bartender 
LUCIFER: You exist to protect me 
MAZE: Whatever the danger, 
I'll be there to stop it 
Now that we are stuck here, 
I need to figure out where I fit in
MAZE: I got paid
As a bounty hunter
I need you to help me
I'd have Maze do it, but she's off bounty hunting
Demons don't have a soul
If I die, I just die
- Previously on Lucifer - Still no sign of Lucifer?
I went by his place He's gone
Lucifer, who is this?
Meet Candy Morningstar, my wife
The issue? That would be Lucifer disappearing
and then popping back up with zero explanation
and a ditzy bimbo on his arm
I thought that she meant something to you
I had to save her from
From you You're not ignoring Chloe, you're protecting her
Are you going to Paris? Can I be your travel buddy?
I love Paris
This is the Paris Hotel in Vegas
Not going there
Vegas and me not pretty
And I have held the real truth back from you
Why is it not working?
You know, I keep caring,
and you just just
No, Detective, I
Welcome back to the land of the living, Mr Getty
What?
What happened?
Just a little brush with death
You had us worried there for a while
Oh
Is my wife here?
No
I'm sorry, you haven't had any visitors
Well
we have been having some trouble lately
But you know what?
Second chance on life
Maybe it's not too late to turn things around
No, you wouldn't
No
So, sorry to shag and run, darling, but, uh,
I'll see you next time
All right
Ah Lovely
Who the hell does he think he is?
Lucifer Morningstar
You're serious? That's his name?
What kind of idiot calls himself that?
The kind who owns this place
Don't think I haven't noticed you watching me
I know what this is about
You do?
Yes,
and the answer is no
I will not sleep with you
Excuse me?
It's not because you're a man It's just because
Well, I don't find you attractive
But maybe I could
introduce you to someone more, you know, your league?
There's a chubby fellow over there
I'm sure he wouldn't mind giving you a reach-around or something
I'm married to a woman, thank you very much
Oh Does she know you're gay?
My wife,
who's the smartest and funniest person I ever met,
and the only woman that I've ever loved,
is sleeping with another man
A sleazy, arrogant, womanizing piece of garbage
Well, then, why are you wasting time trying to pick me up?
You should be punishing him
Oh, don't worry I'm going to
Oh, are you? Great
What are you gonna do, spoons to the eyes?
Ants inside his urethra?
A Urethra Franklin, as I like to call it
I think I'm just gonna punch him in the face
Well, that's not enough for someone who stole your wife
- You're right - Yeah
You should destroy him
Tear his very life apart piece by piece
And normally, I'd help you do that,
but I've picked up a new hobby recently Detective!
Detective?
Yes LAPD, and I'm a consultant
You? You work with the police?
Started a couple of weeks ago It's quite fun, actually
Hey, you know, I've been trying to reach you
Detective, meet my new friend Uh
- Uh, Reese - Hi
Ah Owner of the pieces
Good to meet you
Uh, sorry to interrupt, but I need
my consultant to sober up and join me at a crime scene
Oh, sounds lovely All right
Nice meeting you
Yes Oh
Good luck with the punishing
Hey, boss, I got something
Sleeping in your office again?
No, I'm working on my new story
It's about a shady nightclub owner
My top investigative reporter wants me to approve a piece
about overpriced booze and go-go dancers?
No, no, it's a con man
On paper, didn't even exist five years ago
Tells everyone he's the Devil
So he's a weirdo I don't see a story
He's consulting for the LAPD
I've got a bad feeling this guy's up to no good
Remember the last time I had a bad feeling?
How can I forget your Pulitzer
when you won't stop reminding me?
This son of a bitch is hiding something
Who he is, how he's exploiting the police
Whatever it is, the people deserve to know the truth
Bringing this guy down,
there wouldn't be a personal reason behind it, would there?
No Of course not
Lucifer!
Reese Excuse me
What are you doing here?
Have you come to tell me about the punishment you delivered?
Probably not best to go into detail in a police station
No After we met last night, I realized how
fascinating you are
Oh, well, I can't argue with that
I'm a journalist for the LA Telegraph
So I pitched my editor, and she said I could do a piece on you
No What, an entire article dedicated to me?
Right Well, let's start with a talk
Gosh, this'll be fun
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
Can you tell me about this guy, Lucifer?
Yeah, he calls himself "the Devil"
He helped me out with some gambling debts
Saved my life
Five years ago?
I heard he was somewhere terrible down south
He introduced me to my husband
And my horse
Maybe Florida?
It's weird, but this is LA
I don't know what to tell you I love the guy
Just love that guy
Everyone here just loves Lucifer
I don't like Lucifer
Really?
For starters,
someone's been stealing my pudding
And I don't think it's a coincidence
that it all started when he showed up
No
And I'm not exactly in love with the idea of my wife
putting herself in danger just so some club owner
can have fun playing cop
You and Detective Decker are married?
We're separated
Oh, but still,
that's got to be hard watching them
frolic around in front of you
I wouldn't say "frolic"
Happy to keep this off the record
Separated is not divorced There's still time
Excuse me Hi
Uh, I know you
Aren't you the guy from Lux?
Reese Getty, LA Telegraph
I'm here to write a story about you and Lucifer
Oh, right
"Former B-movie Actress Turned Detective
Works With a Whack-Job Consultant"
Sounds about right
Yeah No thanks
Detective Chloe Decker I did my research
Hot Tub High School, your dad, I get it
You don't like the press
I don't have time for this
I have work to do that actually contributes to society
I hate to be the one to break it to you,
but your lieutenant and my editor are like this
I've been assigned to ride along with you, Detective
So we can either make this a pleasant experience,
or we can do it the hard way
I'll pick the hard way
So, you just started showing up at crime scenes,
and eventually, she let you work with her?
Uh, more or less
Yeah Um, excuse us
No, no, no, just I'll stay out of your way
Just pretend I'm not here
Here you go
What am I supposed to do with these?
Wear them like you always do
- Oh, right, yeah - Mm-hmm
- I don't - Hi
Our victim's name is Poppy Parker
She owns an organic cosmetics line
Sort of a local celebrity for all-natural skin care
And, uh, what are all these?
These are boobs Yes, I'd know them anywhere
C-cups to be precise
Oh, look at these
Please don't
juggle the evidence, Lucifer
But it's fine if he does, 'cause,
you know, they've already been processed
They're called "fun bags" for a reason
Actually, this one is a calf implant, so you should
have that, Detective Douche
Looks like you've been skipping leg day
Yeah, they're very, um, low quality, actually
More outdated
than Dan's flip phone
Don't think any
surgeon in LA would use these
Hmm Okay We'll look into it
Lucifer, he does this
He notices things that normal people are too
normal to notice,
but it, uh,
has a tendency of paying off
It does
Why would he do this
to someone who values natural beauty?
To punish her?
Well, that is a very good question, Daniel,
but as an expert in punishment,
because I'm the Devil
- Hmm - This isn't punishment
This looks like
someone making a statement
Well, maybe you're right
Needle mark on the lip,
bruising around the injection This wasn't postmortem
Poppy wasn't as all-natural as she wanted everyone to believe
She's a fraud
Someone wanted
to reveal that the people around her can't trust her
Ah
If that's the case, I've seen this before
Oh, very good Go, Reese Lightning
So, Daniel Moore, vegan chef
Curiously found with raw meat in his mouth
Ah So vegans can't enjoy a healthy sex life?
Tough crowd
Turns out, he owns a cattle ranch
in Montana, and the environmentalist who was found
drowned in jet fuel, he actually owned a private plane
So, someone's killing charlatans Ah
The worst kind of scum
Next to boy bands
All three victims had trace amounts of
the exact same poison in their system
Same profile, same MO
This is a serial killer
Yes The Completely Justified Killer of Phonies
If that's what you name him, I want credit
The first scene was found over a month ago
The environmentalist, a week ago
And Poppy here was found just a few days later
I think the killer is becoming more obsessed
He's accelerating his timeline
We have to catch this guy before anyone else dies
Why does Lucifer work with you?
I told you, it's an
unconventional partnership, and it just
That's not it
What's he get out of it?
You'll have to ask him
Hi, hon
I know you've been avoiding me
I mean, things have been off lately
But I want to try and turn things around
Can we talk?
I miss you
Leave Lucifer Morningstar alone
Or you'll be too dead to regret it
I'm onto something, aren't I?
You can't scare me off
I've been threatened by worse than you
I guarantee you haven't
Oh, Mr Getty
I need you to look up this address
Something shady
- going on here - O-Okay, but there's, uh
Got to be a drug den, human trafficking
Mr Getty, your wife's in your office
Really?
My wife?
How do I look?
Uh
Reese
We need to talk
Linda
You look wow
We should go to dinner
Our favorite Italian place is still open
I'll make reservations
Reese, why are people in your office calling me your wife?
Because you are my wife
No We're separated
It's been two years
That's actually why I'm here
I have been more than patient, but it's time
Sign the divorce papers, please
Is this because you're seeing someone else?
No No, this isn't because I'm seeing someone, Reese
You can't keep leaving me voicemails like that
Things are not "off lately," things are over
You need to move on
I can't move on
Don't you know how much I love you?
You never give up
It's one of the reasons I fell in love with you
But that was a long time ago
Not that long ago
This is classic denial
It's a self-defense mechanism that you
Don't analyze me, Linda
Sorry
We're over
Sign them
I'm working on something, and I need a little more time
Why? Nothing you're working on is gonna change anything
24 hours, that's all I'm asking for
Okay, if I do
you'll finally sign the papers?
I promise
Hey Did you find anything about that address yet?
It's a known hot spot for trading stolen goods
I knew he was up to something
Fencing? Smuggling? Or worse?
Well, I can do some research on the building
No, I need proof right now
Lucifer's duffel bag
I need to get it
Another piano?
What the?
Uh, uh, don't worry
I'm gonna get you out of here
Well, hello
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, it appears I've caught you sneaking into my penthouse
So perhaps you should answer that question
What story are you really looking for, reporter?
I'm gonna expose you for the fraud you are
And save this woman
Don't you try and stop me
I won't She might, though
Who is this guy, Lucifer?
He doesn't seem very fun
You're not tied up against your will?
Um, no
I'm pretty into this
At least I was until you got here
All right, that doesn't matter
I know I'm onto something
Otherwise, why would you send that crazy ninja woman after me?
Crazy ninja wom oh, Maze?
No, I didn't send her
She's just a tad overprotective, that's all
Demon bartenders, you know how they can be
What about that pile of cash I saw you give that cop?
Yes, to buy his duffel bag
Hard to find quality leather
with such tensile strength
The bag
That's right
This will prove everything
What is this?
Are these sex toys?
Edible sex toys,
to be precise
Not exactly FDA approved,
so I had to sneak the delicious things
through customs
How could I be so wrong?
About so many things?
Look, I know why you're upset
You thought you had a nice, juicy scoop for your paper
And I don't blame you You're just doing your job
Unfortunately for you, the only juicy thing here
is the, uh Watermelon Willies
They're pretty good You should try one
- Mm - I'm allergic to watermelon
Oh Look, why don't you come with me?
The detective just called with some sort of lead
I always find catching a killer cheers me up
I mean, I was gonna do Veronica first, but
you don't mind waiting, do you, darling?
- Not at all - Good
Come on
Excuse me
Do you mind?
Thank you
You were right about the implants
They were pulled from the market years ago due to rupturing
Oh, a moment of silence for all those poor, mishandled breasts
They're illegal to sell anywhere,
but we pulled a partial serial number
that pointed to a plastic surgeon's office
in Beverly Hills
Wait, you, Scarface?
You resent your clients, don't you?
- I don't - You want them to suffer
I do
I want all of them to suffer
Good work on the case
Realizing that his scar
made him resent other people around him
that was good
Good detective work
Reese, you okay?
Reese
You were right
About?
I wanted to write a piece that showed that your partnership
was a dangerous joke
That Lucifer was a fraud
But the truth is
he's just frustratingly, annoyingly
a charming guy
And you and him
you two work well together
There's no story here
I'm just gonna drop it
Is this some weird journalist tactic
to get me to lower my guard?
I wish
No, this is just me getting out of the way,
so you can do your job
Catch more killers
Unfortunately, Barry's not our killer
He sold expired medical goods
from the office, including some tainted Botox
that poisoned a few people
And although
he'll spend a very long time in jail,
he's not our guy
But if he sold supplies to the killer,
he should know something
Well, he wouldn't give us any information on the buyer
Probably scared, but we'll get it out of him
Detective, the lieutenant's asking for you
Okay
Uh, excuse me
Be right back
Thank you
Right
Now the detective's gone, let's have a chat
Just the two of us, shall we?
Look, I don't know anything, okay?
Yes, yes, you plead ignorance,
and then we sweat you until you finally give us a name
I'm sorry, I don't have time for that
I've got a lovely lady tied up back at my place
So I'd like to speed things up
Listen, listen, man,
I wait
Please stop! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I don't know his name!
I only know his, his username, okay?!
"TruthDog21"!
Please! Stop!
Oh, oh!
Oh
Oh
You have to stop seeing Lucifer Morningstar
How did you get that name?
- Uh - Okay, invading my privacy
is one thing,
but if you're stalking my clients
I'm not stalking him
I was working on a story with him
Oh, okay, so you just happened to be working on a story
with Lucifer
Okay, I know this sounds crazy, it
He's the Devil
And I-I don't mean in-in a,
in a douchebag, club-owning kind of way
I mean
he's the actual Devil
Yes, Lucifer is insistent on this Devil persona
No, he isn't some patient
That's just a ploy that he used to seduce you
Okay, so that's what this is about
It is none of your business
who I sleep with
It is if it's Satan himself
I don't think you've understood exactly what it is you're doing
Oh, I know exactly what I'm doing
I'm enjoying myself with someone
who doesn't make me feel trapped
Lucifer is someone who is
completely present in the moment
Who gives me 100% of his attention
And doesn't demand anything from me
I guess if you want to vilify him
and call him the Devil
No, he is the Devil
But being with him
is the most liberating experience of my life
I see, he's-he's got you under some sort of spell
You know, I've been incredibly patient with you,
because I still care about you,
still worry about you
But I just can't take it anymore
Okay, if I can come up with proof that he is the Devil
Sign the papers!
You've got a lot you need to figure out, Reese
You're right
I do
Reese?
It's Detective Decker
We could really use your help
How can I help you, Detective?
Shower and a shave, maybe
We're here about the serial killer case from last year
I thought the killer went dormant
He has,
but we're still investigating the case, and we've had a break
All the victims were
local celebrities who were featured
in the Telegraph's style section
You think he read the article?
And we hope he commented on them We have a handle
we think he used, TruthDog21
Well, the comments are public
- You can search them - We have
We didn't find anything, but we want
But I was complaining to the detective
about some posts of mine that have been removed
from a web site for roosters of award-winning size
You see, I was posting pictures of my
Okay
Okay
Does your paper archive redacted comments?
Uh, anything that's threatening or violent
Or of award-winning size
Uh, yeah, sure
Just give the information to my assistant
He'll gather the info It might take a day or two
- Thank you - Mm-hmm
You still haven't destroyed him, have you?
Excuse me?
That sleazy piece of garbage
who was sleeping with your wife
No
I'm starting to think
that he might be undestroyable
Well, perhaps you're not
thinking outside the box enough, Reesey
Don't be afraid to take a big swing
It can be therapeutic
Oh, speaking of
I'm late for my own therapy Again
She's gonna kill me
She said that was a ridiculous idea
- Linda - Reese
What, you know him as well?
- My ex-husband, Reese - Linda
- Stay back - Your ex-husband?
So we're tunnel buddies
Hey
You realize what you just did?
You just ruined a perfectly good Burberry
- What kind of monster are you? - See?
- He's the Devil! I told you - Y-You tried to kill him
Yeah, but I didn't He's invincible because he's the Devil
- See? There's your proof - Reese
You're lucky the detective isn't here
You'd be cleaning my blood out of the couch
Put the gun down, Reese
Right, I don't need it anymore Look, I
I know it's a lot to process,
but you've got to believe me
Reese, I know he's the Devil
What?
You you you do?
Is this what you were trying to tell me all those months ago?
I saw his real face
If you see it, then you'll know
I have seen it
And I know
I know
- how unsettling it can be - Yes
And if you're this unsettled by me,
I'd hate to see what you're gonna do
to the scoundrel who's been sleeping
with your wife
I'm so sorry
I didn't realize what you were going through
I didn't know the truth,
and I didn't think you did either
But you know now
And you're still seeing him?
Only professionally, Reese,
much to my disappointment
When I first learned who he really was, it
it-it turned my world upside down
But he's not what you think
He's the Devil!
Oh, it's not like I've hidden that fact
- He's evil incarnate! - No
No, he's a good man
He's my friend
All this time I've been
trying to prove to you who he really is
And not only
did you already know
you didn't care
Sit down, Reese, let's talk this through
- No, no - Please, Reese
Your assistant left your redacted comments research
on my desk
Are you still working on this nightclub owner thing?
He's not just a nightclub owner
So do you have a story for me, something I can actually print,
or just arts and crafts?
This has to stop
- Now - I can't
I can't let this guy win
You have filed, barely,
a dozen other stories this year
And you have nothing to show for all this work
Reese!
This guy has won
I'm telling you this as your friend
If you don't
let this go, it's going to be the end of your career
You're lucky the detective isn't here
You'd be cleaning my blood out of the couch
- Alvin Kapitski? - Yeah
Registered on the LA Telegraph web site
as "TruthDog21"?
I wanted to ask you a few questions
about some comments that you posted
on some stories we ran about Poppy Parker
and Daniel Moore
Okay
Okay
I knew this day would come
I'll surrender quietly
Oh, no
I'm not a cop
I'm a reporter
I just want to talk to you
You're here to do a story on me?
Well, my job is to dig up the truth
Expose people for who they really are
And once I saw your work,
I-I realized that
- you were just doing the same thing - Yeah
Yeah, I was
I'm back on my meds now
I'm trying to be good It's hard, but I'm trying
- I'm trying, I'm trying - I get it
It's just, I met this guy
recently
Biggest fraud I'd ever encountered
Yeah?
I tried to expose him,
show everybody the liar that he really is
What happened?
He won
They always do, don't they?
Unless someone does something
What's his name?
Hi
- Thanks for coming - Hey,
you're helping me, so thanks
Although I have no idea why we had to meet here
Those them?
Yeah, uh,
all the redacted comments
Uh, but first,
I never did get to interview you
You know, you really had me fooled
Thought you were different
Fine, ask away
What do you think Lucifer gets
out of this partnership?
You already asked me that
Uh, but you never answered
Um I think,
a long time ago,
somebody wronged Lucifer
I think he avoided dealing with it,
and he hides
behind the partying
and the women and the drinking, and who knows what else
And with the LAPD,
working on each case, it gives him an opportunity
to right those wrongs, to fight back
Oh
You think that's funny?
Uh, no, no I'm sorry
I just think, uh,
you give him more credit
than he deserves
Well, I don't think you give him enough
You may be right
Thanks, Detective
Um
these, uh
these look incomplete
Help! Help, help!
- Help! Help! - Help! Help!
She's dead
What happened?
Yeah, you were right
Looks like the same poison
that was used by that serial killer
you guys were after
They did this under my own roof
My home
How-how could the killer be here
the exact same time we were?
Must be something, must
It must be you
What? What do you mean?
He was here for you
He must have figured out that you were gonna
pass over information about him
I'm so sorry
This is this is all my fault
I'm to blame I put you in danger
No, no, no, this is not your fault
There's only one person who's to blame for this
Yeah
I'm in no mood for whatever it is
You
This is all your fault
You ruined my life You drove me to do things
I never would've done
And now
there's a dead girl down there because of you
What is it with you humans?
Huh? Always blaming me
I never make any of you do anything
That's not true
You trick us
into sin,
damnation
I have a story for you, reporter
One I've never told a human soul before
I take no part in who goes to Hell
Then who does?
You humans
You send yourselves
Driven down by your own guilt
Forcing yourselves
to relive your sins over and over
And the best part
the doors aren't locked
You could leave anytime
It says something
that no one ever does, doesn't it?
No
You're to blame
I am responsible for a lot of things, Reese,
but not your soul,
not your actions,
and not whoever killed that poor girl downstairs
Eh, you
you have to be
Otherwise
Hurting me is not what you really want to do, is it?
What are you doing to me?
Oh, you're a complicated one, aren't you, Reese?
Strong
Tell me
what do you truly desire?
I
I just want Linda to love me
You're still in love with your ex?
What about your wife?
She is my wife
She'll always be my wife
So hold on,
that-that sleazy, piece of garbage, that
that was me?
It was me
The way she looks at you
Ah
She cares for you
How'd you do that?
How did you convince her that the Devil, of all people
was good?
I don't know
I just showed her my true self
But how could she accept you after that?
Well, maybe she did because of that
Hmm
Before you say anything, hear me out
There's nothing you can say
I was a bad husband
Put my work above everything,
above us
Our marriage failing
was all my fault
And I'm sorry
You deserved better
Well, if we're if we're being honest
it wasn't all your fault
I wasn't perfect either
Truth is
neither one of us could be what the other one needed
That's why it's good
that we're going our separate ways
But, Linda, no, no, I
I thought me opening up would bring us closer
Like it did with you and Lucifer
Reese,
that's not how this works
You forgave the Devil
Why can't you forgive me?
You know, for a second,
I thought that you were honestly taking responsibility
But it's always the same with you, over and over
So determined, you never listen, never learn
Do you know how much I love you?
The things that I've done for you
I went up against the Devil
I risked everything getting involved with a serial killer
A poor girl got killed!
Wait, what?
I-I can explain
Reese, what have you done?
No, it-it wasn't my fault
- I'm calling the police - No
It was an accident
I-I didn't mean for any of this to happen
- Reese - Stop
- Let me explain - Reese, let go of me
- Reese - No, no!
- No! - Reese, no!
Oh, God I'm sorry
You're right
Call Detective Decker
Tell them they can find me at my office
I'll give them everything that I have on Kapitski
And I'll turn myself in
I'm sorry
You were right
Let me make this right
Good-bye, Reese
You sent me to kill the wrong man
Lucifer wasn't a fraud
He's an honest man
As honest as they come
No, no, the fraud is you!
Reporter lying to people
A coward trying to get another man to do his dirty work
You're the one who deserves to go next
And now you will
What are you laughing about?
I caught you
Crap!
Let go! No!
Stay down
Oh, Reesey
You laying down on the job?
Don't tell me, asthma
That
or the poison I drank
Well
you didn't drink all of it
I set things right
Maybe this will turn things around
with Linda
Welcome back to the land of the living, Mr Getty
What
what happened?
Just a little brush with death
You had us worried there for a while
Is my wife here?
No
I'm sorry, you haven't had any visitors
Well
we have been having some trouble lately
But you know what?
Second chance on life
Maybe it's not too late to turn things around

- Previously on Lucifer - He is so into you
- You're joking - Uh, no
Scorching fire, five-alarm
I can see why Lucifer is so affected by you
It's because you're special, Decker
Being a celestial insider
really sucks
I was in a really dark place, but someone
helped me gain perspective 
LUCIFER: Now Maze is off bounty hunting again 
ELLA: Being good takes practice
Keep at it and you'll get better
I guess I should take that job then
What job?
The Sinnerman is not a myth
I butted heads with him in Chicago Did not end well
LUCIFER: Not only did he stick my wings back on and take my face, 
he's stolen my schtick, as well 
He gives out favors to people
And I think that maybe 
it's about time I got back in the game 
Previously on Lucifer
The reason I started granting favors again
- was because of the Sinnerman - Do you think this is 
the same guy that kidnapped you and dumped you in the desert? 
I may need proof that this guy is real
He is real And very dangerous
I quit my job Today is my first day
in the district attorney's office
- Surprise - So why is your gift desire?
Desire is the ultimate expression of free will
I help people do whatever or whomever they want
Hello
I thought you were looking for me 
Come on Let's talk
In here!
You want to do your little desire shtick? 
When I find out what someone truly desires,
I find out their greatest weakness
Why is this case so important to you?
The Sinnerman killed my brother
- I need to make him pay - That's him
You're under arrest
Look into my eyes!
Now you will never know what I want
911 What is your emergency? 
Please, I need help! He's gonna kill me! Please!
Ah-ha!
Nothing screams weekend like tequila and scantily-clad women
And tequila Cheers
- It's Wednesday - Mmm
Exactly The party's just begun
Why are we celebrating again?
Well, isn't it obvious?
We apprehended the cad who arranged for my kidnapping,
gave me wings,
took away my devil face
Finally, Maze, answers will be mine
Right
If you could say that with less sarcasm, I'd appreciate it
No, no, I'm sure you're right
I'm sure a human jail will stop a soldier of God
That's actually more sarcasm
I'm just saying,
devil face, wings big deal
If he wanted to hit you where it really hurts,
there are other things he could do to you,
- or take away - Oh
I'm talking about your life in LA, Lucifer
The club, your job
- Chloe - I know what you're talking about!
But I won't allow it
I can assure you, the only threat
the Sinnerman poses from now on is that ridiculous name
Mmm
They're bringing him in for questioning in the morning,
so I'll get what I need to break him then
Good luck mojoing a blind guy
I don't need eyes
to find out the Sinnerman's desire, ergo his weakness
There are other ways to learn what someone wants
What ways?
Just ways
Oh!
Hello
It's so hard
Yes, always, but why don't I help you with your stick first?
Go on!
- Oh, condoms! - I'm gonna enjoy every condom!
They're the ribbed kind!
- T minus ten, people - Yes, sir
The prisoner is in the house
Eye on the prize, no screwups, and no one talks to him alone
Man, I just love watching Pierce work
It's like a master class in ass-whoop
with a minor in whatevs
Yeah
I'm just surprised at how well he's holding up
- Well, it is his job - No I mean, it's just,
there's no way I could be that stoic
if the Sinnerman had killed my brother
Wait, what?
I knew the case was personal, but his own flesh and blood?
Holy bananas, he must totally need a hug
Ella, wait
But Pierce needs our support right now
I didn't know it wasn't common knowledge
All right, this isn't even my secret to share
Right, of course, 'cause he's so private
and brooding and hot
Not that that is at all relevant
Look, he's on edge
- Just don't bring it up, okay? - Okay
Right Through this way Come on
Keep going this way
Nice to see you all again
- What Too soon? - Come on
Yeah, yeah
He's certainly oozing remorse
Pierce
We know he kidnapped Lucifer,
we have physical evidence tying him to the hair salon,
the kid with broken legs I saw him with a gun,
standing over the guy he shot Don't worry
At this point, a confession's just icing on the cake
- It's over - Is it?
Ah, good
Just in time for the main event
Right Why don't you two make yourselves comfortable,
and I'll take first crack at Helen Killer here
What? I thought he deserved a new nickname now that he's blind
I mean, you have to admit, the Sinnerman has become a tad old
Not happening
Last time you talked to him, he gouged his own eyes out
Yes, a minor inconvenience, especially for him
I mean, can you imagine living in LA
and not being able to enjoy the sunset?
Yeah, there's not much of a view from prison
That's not the point
- No one's talking to him but me - What?
You can't seriously be suggesting
that you're the impartial party here
I mean, he's clearly your Moby Dick,
and we all know what happened to Captain Ahab
Felled by savage revenge,
dragged to the bottom of the sea?
Gosh, did they teach you nothing at cop school?
I've read Moby Dick six times
Oh, really What happened on page 83?
So, what should I call you?
- Sinner, is it? - Ah
Mr Man?
A census taker once tried to test me
Excuse me?
I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti
Ah No I'm-I'm sorry
Always wanted to do that
I mean
Do love that film, though
Interesting time to make jokes when two people are dead
Mm
Whatever your name is,
this insanity plea it's not gonna fly
You may be sick, but I know you're not crazy
Nope
There's a definite method to my non-madness
- Care to elaborate? - No
No, you'll figure it out
Eventually
Doesn't matter
We've got enough to put you away for a long, long time
Oh, speaking of,
what time is it?
I can't see my watch
- Ella - The Sinnerman's phone from evidence
I'd pick up if I were you
Oops
Too late
Or you better hope it's not
No! Please! Please! Will you please help me?! 
What is that?
Wild guess: a woman trapped in a reservoir
that will fill with water,
oh,
pretty soon, I'd say
Another victim? How is that possible?
Always keep 'em guessing
Where is she?! Who else are you working with?
Well, I could tell you, but what fun would that be?
- Please help! - The only way she'll survive
is if I take you to her
Right
Who's up for a field trip?
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx <font color="#0080ff">www</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">com</font>
911 What is your emergency? 
Please Please, I need help! 
Please He's gonna kill me! Please! 
This is her initial 911 call
The Sinnerman was in custody when this woman was abducted,
which means he's working with someone on the outside,
an accomplice
Right Find the accomplice, find the girl
Ella, what do we know about her?
Uh, yeah Maggie Cole, 26, lives in Echo Park
Tech tried pinging her cell, but the battery's gone dead
What about tracing the call from the Sinnerman's phone?
Blocked and rerouted through a server in Delhi,
so, like, zilch way to track her, which is
Wonderful news!
Means we can save the life
of poor, doomed Maggie the far more expedient way
We are not letting the Sinnerman out of here
He clearly desires freedom, which means
he's motivated and likely telling the truth
Following his lead will be much faster
than running down clues, dodging red herrings
and following up on random tips from every
Tom, Dick and Dullard
Hey, guys
Uh, unis they checked out the
parking lot at Maggie's apartment
No sign of her or her car
Ah See? I'm telling you
Obi Wan Can't-See-Me is Maggie's only hope
This is an obvious escape plan
Find another way
Fine
Fine If you insist on doing it the long way and investigate,
we may as well hurry up and inevitably get back to my idea
Okay
What is Trixie doing coloring crime scene photos at a desk
when we have a psychotic killer in custody?
Well, she's done wonders with that mangled corpse, though
Very artistic
Didn't you book Mrs Baczynski?
Look, I meant to, Chloe, but I totally spaced
on this random day off school
But don't worry
I'm handling it, 'cause I'm Super Dad
Chloe, come look at this
Wait
Zoom in
Got a pretty good idea where Maggie spends her time
Thanks Come on
And there they are on the first course
the bombastic Blazing Banshees!
And their decidedly devious opponents, the Derby Divas!
They're all out there fighting, ladies and gentlemen
So, Derby Divas versus the Blazing Banshees
It's derby's most notorious rivalry
Oh, ladies to go I'll take two
- Wow - Whoa!
Nice sausage
What? So, those aren't ladies?
No Sausage It's an offensive maneuver
When Trixie started roller-skating,
I took her to the derby, and it was love at first sausage
Ah Right, well, as much as I'd love a bite,
how about we get back to proving
that your method of finding Maggie isn't as good as mine?
Score is now two to two
Hello there
We're looking for some misleading information
on a missing person Maggie Cole
The Slayer is missing?
When's the last time you saw her?
Uh, she ditched practice yesterday,
and she hasn't returned my calls since
Since what?
Since she got into one doozy of a booby brawl
with our blocker, Helena Handbasket
Helena Handbasket Very clever
Took both our pivots to break it up
Oh, right Let me guess Helena?
- And there's Helena Handbasket - Y'all didn't hear it from me
Right
- Helena, can we - Busy!
- ask you a few - No way!
questions?
Eat me!
Yes, please
LAPD! Stop skating now!
What on Oh! Sorry! Sorry
I don't think so
She's gonna rack up some more points
Whoa!
Has to be a foul
The Banshees and the Divas are fighting it out
One beer, please
- Is this really the time? - Always
Cheers
Well, get the cuffs out
Two more, two more points
The Banshees pull ahead
Well, I've no idea what the Sin Bin is,
- but I approve - It's the penalty box
- Oh Right - Want to explain why you ran?
Because you were chasing me
See? No harm, no foul
No, you ran because you realized we're cops
This is all Maggie's fault
Typical, she ratted me out
So, hold on, you're saying you did abduct Maggie?
Abduct? What? No I just roughed her up a bit
Roughed her up, why?
Because she stole my spot as lead jammer
- Ah - You know, after Faith Kill
had that car accident?
Maggie didn't deserve that position
She can't even snowplow
Oh, wheels turning,
old theory crumbling, and the only way
- to discard this witness - Where were you last night, Helena?
a plausible alibi
I was on fresh meat patrol
Ooh, good for you, Helena
No, it means training a new crew
- Oh - Shocker
they sucked I was here all night
I didn't abduct no one
What about Maggie's car did she park here at the rink?
Nah Free lot over on 6th
Maggie isn't just a job-hogging bitch,
she's a cheap job-hogging bitch
Right
Well, come on, Detective, chop-chop
More dead-end clues aren't gonna find themselves
Uh, hi, Mrs Baczynski?
Wow Um
my-my deepest condolences
Well, sweetheart, you won't be staying
with Mrs Baczynski today
Or ever again
Great parenting, Dan
Good to know that I'm not the only
questionable parent these days
Uh, Charlotte Hey Hi Yeah
Yeah, not my finest moment
You're pretty
How do you know Daddy?
She's my, uh,
work colleague
Sometimes, uh, friend S-Sometimes
Um
how's the new job at the, uh, the DA's office?
Dull What's a girl got to do to get a nice, grisly murder
or a few underage drug mules?
I like you You're funny
And you're short
Hey,
what can I get you, sweetie?
Mocha whip with a shot of "expresso"
Ye Wh No No, not gonna happen
Mommy lets me
That statement would never hold up in court
Decent poker face, though
Bye
Bye
Daddy, I have an idea
If we can find Maggie's car,
it may lead us to the Sinnerman's accomplice
Or be a shameful waste of the poor girl's precious time
What about wasting my time?
What happened to being on the same page?
You know, partners? Being a team?
Detective, I can assure you this is all about
me making sure you and I remain a team
You know
Maggie's car
- Plates match - Right
Lucifer, we have to call forensics before we taint the evidence
What, and waste more of poor Maggie's precious time?
Lucifer, no
Oops
Whoever rigged that grenade 
wanted that car to explode the instant someone touched it
No trace evidence means we still have
no way of tracking Maggie
I can't believe I'm suggesting this, but
Okay, fine, perhaps I shouldn't have touched the car
we need to bust out the Sinnerman
Uh not what I was expecting, but
thank you, Detective, for finally seeing things my way
Well, you clearly feel strongly about this
For better or worse, you are my partner,
so I need to have your back on this
Just one question, though
How do you suggest we get him out of here?
I actually have a plan
But in order for it to work, you need to do exactly what I say
No more going off grid,
no more destroying trace evidence,
no more Luciferness
Is that clear?
As a chilled vodka martini
Served neat, of course
First we need the keys to holding
What, the same keys old stiff-as-a-board Pierce
has locked away in his office?
Guess we'll need a distraction
About that Pierce thing this morning
I cannot
- stop thinking about that poor man - Me, too
He's really going through a lot
Maybe a little Ella
is exactly what the doctor ordered
Crafty maneuver, Detective But do you really think
Ms Lopez will fall for such a blatant manipulation?
Uh
Oh, my God, I'm so in
But here's the thing
I don't want it to seem like I'm blabbing
Pierce's personal business all over the precinct
Totes understood
All over it
I did not hear it from you
I'm going to let him
tell me
Is everything all right, Lopez?
We lost Buttons when I was nine
That was our pet Corgi Buttons, I mean
Sorry for your loss
I mean, once I understood how Buttons got out,
I was able to talk about it, and the healing process
could really begin, you know?
I'll never, ever forget that day
How hard can it be to find one tiny key?
Or for a tiny lab tech to trap a hardened
six-foot-four lieutenant against his will?
For the longest time,
I just wanted to find whoever was driving that evil,
champagne-colored hatchback with the custom spoilers
Uh-huh
But then I realized
it wasn't about the hatchback
It wasn't And
Where could they be?
Okay, assuming we do manage to swipe the keys
to the holding cell, how do we get him out of here?
I mean, our sightless scoundrel doesn't exactly blend
All you have to do is go up to that bomb tech
and hand her this
Consider it handled
Seriously? This is what you want?
The more important question is: what do you want in return?
Even if my charm does work on the bomb tech,
and who are we kidding, course it will, we still
need someone to sell the big finish
Someone deserving
of a very special gift
Aw
What's this?
It's too nicely wrapped
to be another severed head
_
Seriously?
Call the bomb squad!
Everyone evacuate now!
Eat your heart out, George Clooney
Not literally
Understood
I cannot believe that actually worked
Well, it almost worked
Did you really think I was gonna let you bust him out
without me?
Oh, put that down, please
That was given to me by the ambassador of Sweden
It's very
- Ugly? - Valuable
There's nothing fun to do here
I can't touch anything or jump on anything
And you don't have any toys to play with
I thought you'd be more exciting
Well, you could alphabetize
these case files
You don't have kids, do you?
Actually, I do Two
- They live with their father - That makes sense
Um, well, it's for the best
since I'm so busy at work, and if you don't mind,
I'd like to get back to it, if I'm ever gonna catch a case
And that makes no sense
Well, if the department sees that I'm working hard
No, about your kids
My mom and dad work,
and they still hang out with me,
together and apart
- Good for them - Monopoly,
roller derby, climbing the wall at the Y
You could do stuff with your kids, too
Well, the truth is
they don't want to see me
You're the mom
You make the rules
Are you and my dad having sex?
Uh
It really is true, how the other senses kick in
once one is removed
I can remove a few others if you'd like
Shut up and walk Both of you
A hundred more yards, then we have to turn east
So, why did Mr By the Book change his mind?
- Why are you helping us? - Because you were right
It's the best way to find the girl
The Sinnerman desires freedom
He wants to escape I'm here to make sure he doesn't
Oh, so you really think this is a trap,
that this accomplice is laying in wait?
Why else would he lead us to the middle of nowhere?
Right Ambush
Well, I guess we'll just have to go nut to butt,
have Charlie do the foxtrot,
cover each other's sixes and all that
You know? Hooah!
Military terms Weren't you a serviceman?
Yeah We don't talk like that
I can't breathe!
I hear something
Help!
Help! Aah!
I can't breathe!
Maggie, hang on!
Come on
Come on I got you
Come on
You're safe now, Maggie
You're gonna be okay
Where's Lucifer?
Where's the Sinnerman?
His accomplice was here Damn it!
They've got Lucifer, too
Come on Pick up Pick up
Hello This is Lucifer 
You know what to do 
preferably in the nude 
Damn it
How could I be so stupid? I knew this was a setup
No Breaking the Sinnerman out was my idea
- This is my fault - It's my watch
This is on me
We're already canvassing
Let's put in an APB for three men
We may not need an APB We have Maggie
I was leaving the rink, and he chased me
I made it to my car, but
he was too strong
He grabbed me,
threw me in a van, and then I woke up here
Did you see his face?
He was wearing a mask
Sounds like it happened fast
How would he have had
enough time to rig the car with explosives?
Um
he must have gone back and put the grenade in later
We didn't mention a grenade
Okay, I
Okay, I made it all up
I wasn't attacked I
I abducted myself
- Why? - All I wanted
was to be my team's lead jammer
But I could never compete
with that spotlight-stealing bitch, Faith Kill
So I went to this guy who grants people favors
We need a name
He just goes by the Sinnerman
I asked him to get rid
of Faith, and the next thing I know,
she's in a car accident
- I never wanted anyone to die - So he took out
your competition, then demanded you repay him
by faking your own kidnapping?
And the 911 call
the explosion
He was going to kill me, too, if I didn't do it
There was never an accomplice
Then who kidnapped Lucifer?
No one He wanted to be alone with him,
so he kidnapped the Sinnerman
Oh, good! You're awake
Just in time for the fun to begin
But, uh before we start, one tiny adjustment
There we go
Much less creepy
Where
where am I?
Well, I thought we'd extend our little field trip
I save my Hills estate for only very special occasions
My very own "sin bin," if you will
Gosh, it's poetic, isn't it?
The man who desired freedom fell into his very own trap
Is that what you want?
- To be my warden? - Oh, no
No, the only thing I desire is answers
So
it's time to make a deal with the Devil
You give me what I want,
and I might give you what you want
I'm not gonna tell you anything
Oh, yes
you are
You had me kidnapped,
dumped in the desert,
somehow made my feathery burdens grow back,
and then took away my devil face
Why?
You will talk
And you will give me what I want: wings off,
devil face back!
Because no one decides who I am but me!
Ooh
I'm sensing this is the part where the said devil face
would kick in, right?
Okay Okay
I'll tell you what you need to do
But it's not gonna be easy First
you have to draw a pentagram,
sprinkle some powdered eye of newt,
and then wait for a full moon
How's your howl?
Freaking impossible to make it through that with a straight face
Tragic error, my sinful thug
Oh What are you gonna do?
Punish a feeble, blind man?
Oh, no, no I wouldn't dream of it
Oh, right, you can't see
Allow me to paint you a picture
Meet Hell's most brutal torturer
The pleasure's all mine
Are we sure he's not celestial?
Are you questioning my expertise?
He's definitely human
- And you tried waterboarding? - Twice
- Bamboo under the nails? - Do I look like an amateur?
Nickelback on repeat?
- That's where I started - Well, what kind of demon
can't procure answers from one puny human?!
You want to give it a try? Be my guest
Gladly Hand it over
No I've pushed that guy to his limit
Anything else might kill him
You and I both know
Angels aren't allowed to kill humans, yes
Or are they?
Lucifer
- don't be an idiot - No, no, no, no
This is the answer to all my problems, Maze
Killing the Sinnerman is exactly what I need to do
We need to find out where Lucifer took him
Unis checked Lux and the penthouse,
but no sign of Lucifer or the Sinnerman
And, of course, his cell's still off
- Any hits on the van they took off in? - Nada
He must have had a car stashed
and then ditched the van on the way
- This may help - What is this?
High-end real estate?
It's every place Lucifer owns
- in Southern California - Part of Espinoza's
Lucifer files
Um, why do you have files on Lucifer?
Chloe and I were married
So what if I did some due diligence
on my wife's new partner? Call it
being protective
Not the word I had in mind Stalker
But whatevs
Lucifer plants a bomb at my desk,
and I'm the creepy one?
Um actually
that was me Sorry
The bomb was fake
Wow Okay
Human heads Explosives
Can someone send me, I don't know,
a muffin basket next time? That'd be nice
There's over a dozen properties here
Oh, and some are, like, an hour away
- I guess we have to check each one? - Maybe not
I think I know where they are
I'm a demon
Big fan of death and destruction
But killing a human
is Angel No-No's 101
Look at your brother total power loss,
and he only got murder adjacent
Precisely my point
If I kill a human, then I lose my wings!
And, because I've been such a naughty angel,
I get my devil face back, and bonus!
I rid humanity of our sightless psychopath
Three birds, one Sinnerman
Mm-hmm In theory, except your Father is going to be pissed
You kill a human,
one that He sent to do His bidding
Exactly!
Look, you said it yourself, Maze
If I don't stop this now, who knows what else he'll do, or
who he might take from me?
Okay
Wait!
Where are you going?
Happy hour at the Chateau
- Text me when you've done the deed - What
Actually
I'll be able to tell by the plague of locusts
You're sure that they're in the Hills?
I mean, pretty sure
He said, "Imagine living in LA
and not being able to enjoy the sunset"
I mean, just like Lucifer to bring a blind man
to the place with the best view
And you know him that well?
Thought I did
Just hope we can get there
before he does something he can't take back
That is an embarrassment of riches, really
So many delicious ways to kill a human
Let me see
Starving rats No
Too time-consuming
Gunshot?
Banal
Oh, I know oldie but a goody
Beheading
Honestly!
Can you at least try to look threatening?
All right
Well, slight improvement
And I can't kill you sitting down
You need to stand up and face me like a man
Well, come on!
I'm to your left
Your other left
I'm right here!
Hello?! Marco!
I
Well, there's no glory in wrestling a starving bear
Perhaps a last meal of some kind to perk you up
Hello
Caviar
You're going to feed me?
Well, just because I'm about to slaughter a man in cold blood
doesn't mean I'm not civilized
No Just means you're stalling
Don't be preposterous
I've waited a long time for revenge
I'm simply savoring the moment
I want you to feel your failure
The knowledge that, long after you're gone,
I shall continue to live here however
and with whomever I choose
Or
you don't have what it takes to kill a man
Not many people do
Perhaps you're a coward
He's here
Evil, smug, homely
Bingo! You win the grand prize at the Painful Death Raffle
So, unless you want a bonus round for being a loudmouth,
- I suggest that - Me?
You're the one doing all the talking
Actually, you know what, I'll boil you alive
Yeah Top most painful way
to die, according to BuzzFeed
Right I'll need a pot A big one
How about drown me with a flood?
Or strike me with lightning?
What cheesy metaphor
would you prefer?
Apple, tree?
A chip off the old block?
Like Father,
- like Son? - Enough!
Pull the string, puppet master
Damn it Where are they?
Take the upstairs
You're right
I don't have it in me to kill a human
Uh, no No, wait
You have to do it
Hold on
I wondered why you,
the evil genius, hadn't sprung a more clever trap
It has to be you
Because I was the trap
You never wanted freedom
Your true desire was to die
And for some reason, you need me to do it
Yes
Yes You supposedly believe in free will
Then honor mine
- Why do you need me to do it? - Free will
Why?! Why?!
No
No!
No
He's gone
Pierce, I'm sorry
I know you didn't want it to end this way
It's the only way it could end
You have clearance
You wanted to see me?
Yes
Something very strange just happened here
Um, a "thank you for saving my life" might be appropriate
I actually wasn't the one in danger
I figured out that you're the one who grabbed the Sinnerman
Clearly, things went south
No Let me explain what happened
What happened was you didn't follow my lead
And, as usual, you did whatever the hell you wanted
Detective, I understand that my interest in getting
our blind barbarian alone may have been a tad selfish,
but it turns out I was the pawn
I don't have time for this
It was the Sinnerman's plan to be snatched by me all along
He wanted to die
Pierce smoothed things over,
if that's what you're worried about
The official statement says that you were grabbed
in an escape attempt
You think I care what Pierce thinks?
No I don't think you care what anyone thinks
That's not true
I told you, I did this for us
For us? For the team?
I had your back on this, Lucifer,
and, for whatever reason,
you still felt the need to go behind mine
Daddy!
Hey
So, the afternoon went well?
Hey, uh, as a thank you for watching Trixie,
maybe we can go grab that coffee sometime?
Uh, we got coffee this morning
Yeah
I'm kidding, Dan
Dinner would be more romantic
- Dinner it is - It's okay by me
- Bye - Bye
You are the best wingman ever
Yes, it's me again
I don't care what they or you say
I want to see my kids
I'm their mother
What are you looking for?
Answers
I mean, there has to be something
in Sinnerman's personal belongings
I'll be right back
I just want to say,
oh, my God, you killed it
I mean, killed him
I mean, I obvi wasn't there-there,
but I just read the crime scene report,
and holy burrito bowl
with your "take down the bad dude" heroics and
Lopez, just stop talking!
What on earth?
Well, I'm here
This couldn't have waited till morning?
Time-sensitive, I'm afraid
Or, in a way, the opposite
Just tell me what you want
Right Well
we're both familiar with the accomplice theory
that our blind barbarian had someone working for him
Yeah
Right, well, then
it occurred to me that, what if the Sinnerman
was the one working for someone else?
What if he was the accomplice?
Exhibit A
Here is Mr Sinnerman as a child
With a man
that he seems very close to
Interesting birthmark
It's a very similar shape to your military tattoo,
actually, wouldn't you agree?
So?
Well, so it stands to reason
that this man would be very, very old by now
Or, if he isn't, he'd have to be
you know, immortal
An immortal crime boss
- Just like you're the Devil - Yes, I know,
it does sound absurd, doesn't it?
So, as such, there's really only
one way to prove my theory
Where did I
Ah, there it is
I wonder why I didn't figure it out sooner
"The world's first murderer,
"marked by God
"and doomed to walk the earth alone
for a tortured eternity"
It's quite the moniker
Yet, still,
nowhere near as ridiculous as the Sinnerman
Wouldn't you agree
Kane?
You may as well pour me one, too

Ah (chuckles)
You take care
All right
Nice suit
Oh, well, thank you very much

This was the height of fashion last time I visited

Oh, pleasure
Always pleasure
Oh, then you came to the right place

(chuckles): Mm!
(groans)
How can someone
who can literally control time
have such atrocious timing?
Toying with humans again, I see
Oh, these poor creatures
They know not what they do
I beg to differ
Everyone here is well aware that they're doing me
Enough foolishness
It's time for me to take you back to Hell
As always
Correction: allow you to take me back, as always
Please
Everyone knows I'm the strongest of God's children
Uh, not everybody
I mean, you've never fought me, have you, huh?
Care to give it a try?
You know damn well that celestial beings
aren't allowed to interact here on Earth
Now, let's go (sighs)
It's dangerous for humanity to be exposed to divinity
Well, I wouldn't sit on that couch--
left a lot of divinity there
Enough!
Now, you can either deal with me,
or you can deal with Father
Yeah
That's what I thought
Very well
Well, at least allow me to say my good-byes
I mean, that's just manners, isn't it? Not that you'd know

You wear it well

My necklace

LUCIFER: And this little demon went, "Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee,"
all into the valley of sin
(laughs)
There's been a change of plans, Luci
Oh, G
Oh Not what I expected, but, uh,
all right, fine, have fun
Just go in the other room
Or not
Sorry, are you going somewhere?
Uh listen, I have an errand to run
Why are there holes in your dress?
It's a robe
Oh, I apologize
Why are there holes in your dress?
Look, I don't trust you to see yourself back to Hell, okay?
So I want you to stay here for a few hours,
and then we'll go
Oh More time in LA
Lucky me (chuckles)
You see, I respect the rule of human law,
which is why I'm seeking your assistance
in a matter of utmost importance
A robbery has occurred
Okay
What was stolen?
My necklace
The estimated value?
It's hard to say, really, uh
It's not of this world, so there's that
Priceless beyond measure
I'll just put down $40
Where did the incident occur?
In an alleyway south of "Cahunana" and Franklin
Cahuenga?
"Cahunana" and Franklin
Now, this thief was armed,
and, oh, yes, uh, I made a rendering
And I do believe that this should help you with your quest
Okay
So a jack-o'-lantern stole your necklace?
So you know this man?
Where can I find this Mr O'Lantern?
Did Paolucci put you up to this?
You know it's a crime to file a false report, right?
You think I would lie?
What? (phone ringing)
Sorry, excuse me
Just two seconds
Hey, honey, what's up?
DAN: I'm not gonna make date night
Oh, that's all right
My mom just called, and she has to shoot tonight,
so she can't watch Trixie anyhow
Well, I'm gonna be home pretty late
You want me to pick up some dinner?
No, that's okay There's stuff for tacos in the fridge,
and we'll make it a thing
We'll call it "Taco Tuesday"
Trixie will love it
Cool
So, what are you doing?
I caught a body on Franklin and Cahuenga
Really?
That's so weird; a guy just came in,
reporting a mugging near there
I wonder if it has anything to do
with your homicide
Lucifer
(groans)
If only angels came with a snooze button
What? What is it, Brother?
A human shot me and stole my necklace
Well, so much for not exposing humanity to our divinity
Which is why I need to get it back, all right?
Oh
Now, I tried to utilize human law enforcement,
but it failed, so
(sighs)
I need your help, Luci
(chuckles) Oh, do you now?
Well, you've always been crafty
smart
Craftier, smarter than you
Yes, and more handsome
Go on
And because you've spent more time with humanity,
you may understand them better than I do
Well, most of that time, I was naked, but true nonetheless
Luci, are you gonna help me or not?
Hmm
Okay
But you have to follow me
*
(siren whooping)
(indistinct police radio chatter)
Detective Espinoza
Excuse me
Officer Decker
Hi Hi
How's it going?
Dan, not at work, remember?
Sorry
Hey, remember the, uh, robbery
I told you about, happened around the corner?
Yeah
Um, so I searched the area,
and I found this
It looks like a key fob
I don't know to what, but it looks like there's blood on it,
and do you think this could be connected to your homicide?
Could be, but even if it is,
all signs point to a random attacker
A serial mugger on a spree Hmm
Looks like my guy resisted and ended up dead
That's the guy that got mugged? Yeah
He's built like a tank Yeah
And so is the guy that reported the robbery
They're the last two guys that I'd try to mug Yeah
Yeah, well, a gun can be a pretty great equalizer
I don't think this was random, Dan
Okay, I'll look into it, but
only when I'm done; it's gonna be a while
Okay, why don't I get a jump on it?
No
Dan, you said to make detective,
I have to show initiative, right?
Right Right Mm-hmm
Let me know what you hear, Officer Decker
(piano playing jazz music)
Oh, lovely
(chuckles) Amazing
Does no one work in this town?
Is this where thieves come to spend their spoils
on wine and women?
Something like that, yeah
Oh Brother, listen to that
Oh
I haven't heard music like that since
well, since the Silver City
What, there's no music in Hell?
Only for torture, and usually out of tune
Lately, we've been playing music by this chap named Bieber
Gosh, you should hear the screams
Why don't you go and, um, grab us a couple of drinks,
and I'll do some reconnaissance
*
Do you take requests?
What do you want to hear?
Uh, myself
Thank you
(sighs)
(playing David Bowie's "Changes")
You didn't come here to find this thief, did you?
You're just trying to stall your return to Hell
Oh, I really hoped to get a few more drinks in
before you worked that one out
Luci, this isn't some game
Now, how many times do I have to tell you?
Humanity should not be exposed to
It's just a necklace, for crying out loud
You promised me that you would help
And I am by distracting you from the painful reality
that you're never going to find it
(resumes playing "Changes")
TV REPORTER: found earlier today near Cahuenga and Franklin
The police have identified the murder victim
as MMA fighter Aiden Scott
Scott's body was found this morning,
the victim of an apparent shooting
Luci, look
His family has been notified
Born in Lancaster, California,
Aiden Scott moved to Los Angeles
What?
I know this man
Uh, the runner, right before the theft
What, you think he had something to do with it?
Exactly, Brother
Whoever killed this Aiden Scott must also be the same thief
who tried to kill me, and then took my necklace
The LAPD currently have no leads
How are we gonna find him
if his own kind can't even locate him?
Which is why I recommend drinking
TV REPORTER: Coming up,
we will learn more about the life of Aiden Scott
and who he left behind We'll talk to some of
Actually, do you know, I think I might be able
to help you, Brother, but I'm gonna need
more than a few extra hours here on Earth
Name your price
Ooh, well, I can't actually think of anything right now,
so how about a blank check,
cashed at a time of my choosing?
Agreed
Well, say it properly
Say it
Deal
Deal
Right, come on
Okay, how about that one?
Too douchey
Too hick
Ah
Hello
Don't you need some sort of key to start it?
(engine starts, revs)
You know me, Brother
I can turn anything on
*
* So w-w-watch me t-t-take it away *
* Watch me take it away (engine revs)
* So watch me take it away
(tires screech, metal clanks on ground)
(chuckles)
Obviously, "R" is for reverse, not "really fast"
* Watch me take it away (Lucifer shouts)
* Watch me take it away
*
(sighs) Hello
What's going on here?
Uh, well, Brother,
when a man and a woman really care about each other,
they do a special cuddle for the cameras,
which they sell for money
Luci, I know what porn is
Oh, do you now?
Focus (chuckles)
What I don't get is how this helps us
track down this thief; why are we here?
Well, two reasons, actually
Uh, boobs
Why am I not surprised?
(chuckles) No, remember that news report thingy?
Well, there was a picture of our dead man
standing next to a very distinctive décolletage
You identified a human by her boobs?
Not any boobs, Brother
These ones are very special
That mole, those curves,
they could only belong to the one and only Misty Canyons
And exactly how does this help me find my necklace?
Well, if we want to find Aiden's killer,
what better way to get information
than from his lover?
Trust me,
a church confessional has nothing
compared to pillow talk
Oh, my gosh, that's her, in the flesh
That's Misty Canyons
Oh, my gosh! That's Penis Demilo
Ha!
What is this, nirvana?
Do all porn stars reside in LA?
Right, how do I look?
Oh, come on, Luci
There must be hundreds of porn stars in Hell
Sadly, no, on account of all the good work
they do here on Earth, I assume
Right, maybe she'll sign my chest,
or something else (chuckles)
Sorry, it's a closed set
I'm here to talk to Misty Canyons about pillow talk
Why didn't you say so?
Ms Canyons
Hi
Lucifer Morningstar (chuckles)
Can I just say that I am a huge, huge fan of yours?
Oh, my gosh Thank you so much
LA Whorey What a classic
Aw I really put my all into that one
Yes, you did, didn't you? And it showed
One might say that you were born for it
Oh Well, my dream is to sing,
but until then, porn pays way better than waitressing
Ah
Plus, I kind of like it
Goodness me, your parents must be so proud
I wish
Well, they told me to do what I love,
and turns out I love sex
Oh, so you're a rebel
(giggles)
I guess so (chuckles)
And if you really want to rebel, move to LA, right?
All I know is that I have never been happier, freer
Uh, we're ready for you on set, Misty
Okay
Well, if you ever do decide
to do something worthy of damnation,
I'd love to see you again
AMENADIEL: Where's the rest of it?
Ooh, I almost forgot
("Pony" by Ginuwine playing)
* If you're horny, let's do it *
MISTY: You must be the window washer
Well, good thing,
because I was feeling dirty
I am here to discuss a lost necklace
MISTY: So, you're a window-washer
jeweler?
No
Well, this took a turn, didn't it?
Well, I haven't seen your necklace
Was it made of pearls, by chance?
It's actually a rod
Unbreakable, very special
Time to see the family jewels
What? No, no, no!
Y-You're not gonna find my necklace down there
The man who killed Aiden Scott has it
What?
Aiden's dead?
Aiden was such a good guy
He accepted everyone, you know?
I can't think of anyone who'd want to hurt him
Even the people he fought respected him
He lost a lot
But he never quit
Aiden actually thought he could win the fight
he had coming up, though, which is why he was so pissed
when someone asked him to throw it
Someone asked him to throw that fight, but he refused?
For a ton of money, yeah
But he didn't care, he just wanted to win,
fair and square
Whoever tried to bribe Aiden to throw that fight
must have been pretty angry when temptation didn't sway him
Maybe the tempter killed him in frustration,
and then took my necklace
You have any idea who approached him?
No I mean, the fight was supposed to be tomorrow
at Rico's in Hollywood
Maybe someone there would know
GIL: Everyone's real torn up about Aiden
We're like family here
So, uh, you were close with him, too?
(chuckles)
He was a scrawny little thing when I started training him
But one dedicated son of a "B"
Nothing could stop that guy
Well, almost nothing
Uh, do you know if Aiden ran the same route every day?
I think so Why?
Well, 'cause if somebody wanted to kill him,
you know, they'd know where he'd be
I thought you cops were saying this was just a random robbery
Did you notice any unusual behavior with Aiden lately?
Uh, arguments, grudges?
Well, actually, there was one guy he butted heads with:
a promoter, Tio Sorrento
Sketchy guy Never paid his fighters
Tio and his tattooed buddy got into it with Aiden
a couple weeks back
But I didn't think anything of it
You know where I can find him?
*
(bell dings)
(crowd cheering)
(women grunting)
I could get used to this place
So what's the plan?
*
Lucifer!
What's the plan?
I
Plan is to get a drink
Can't think when I'm sober
Hello
Apparently, they have, uh,
12 different types of whiskey
Yes, humans are funny
with their infinite capacity for distractions
LUCIFER: It's not distraction, Brother
It's choice
LAPD! Freeze!
Excuse me
If you're through with your distraction,
I'd like to find my necklace
Two fingers of your finest Scotch, please, neat
And, uh, who looks after the fights?
Tio Sorrento Everything goes through him
Thank you
(crowd cheering)
Apparently, you arranged the fight
that a recently deceased Aiden Scott
was going to wage
Let me guess
Your fighter wants on the card tomorrow night
My fighter? But
Oh, yes No, Amenadiel is quite the warrior
Undefeated in battle, one of God's finest
Actually, that's true
How come I've never seen you two before?
What's your name?
Lucifer Morningstar
Pleasure Where are you two from?
Down south Up north
Sorry, I don't book strangers
(chuckles) I'm afraid I must insist
(chuckles)
(crowd gasping)
You just knocked out the former heavyweight champ
with one punch
LUCIFER: Like I said,
God's finest
My man
(laughs)
* We just want to have, we just want to have *
* Yeah, we just want to have fun *
How does this plan help me get my necklace back?
Well, our killer/necklace thief
undoubtedly murdered Aiden Scott for refusing to throw his fight
So, in order to flush out
our killer/necklace thief, we need to get them to approach you
the same way that he or she approached our dead fighter
It's quite simple, really
Or stupid (sighs) Yes
Well, the jewelry recovery playbook's
a little thin here, Brother,
so unless you have any better ideas
Didn't think so
But why do I need to train, Luci?
I am the Silver City's greatest fighter
Again, disputable
You raised a few too many eyebrows
with your one-punch knockout
So no more displays of celestial strength
If we want to be approached,
then you need to learn to fight like a human
¿Comprende?
Okay
Give us your worst
(sighs)
(sighs)
("You're the Best" by Joe Esposito playing)
* Try to be best 'cause you're only a man *
* And a man's got to learn to take it *
* Try to believe though the going gets rough *
* That you got to hang tough to make it *
Go!
* You're the best around
(imitates clucking)
* Nothing's gonna ever keep you down *
LUCIFER: Uh, uh-uh! No
No cheating
* Nothing's gonna ever keep you down *
* You're the best
Eh
* Nothing's gonna ever keep you down *
* Down
(straining)
Very good
Finally
Lovely Yes Yes
Yes
There we go
(Lucifer laughs)
Oh, Brother
Your fighter looks good
Well, I certainly hope so,
'cause I'm ready to make some cash
Which is all I really care about
Cold hard cash
Win or lose?
Whatever it takes
So he'd take a fall?
For the right price
Rumor has it that Aiden Scott was offered a hell of a deal,
so we want the same
Well, that someone is me
Lovely
CHLOE: Dan
Hey, what's up?
Hey Who's that?
One of Tio Sorrento's thugs
The, uh, fight promoter you were telling me about
Yeah Who was seen arguing with Aiden Scott
just before he was killed
Tats here has multiple warrants out,
and after a little squeeze, I found out
that Tio fixes fights for the Sarkisians
As in the Sarkisian crime family?
Yeah, so what if Tio tried to fix Aiden's fight,
and he refused, and he killed him for it?
Well, I'd say that's a pretty interesting theory
I sense there's an "and" coming
And I'd like to talk to Tio's lawyer,
see if I can maneuver a deal Not a good idea
Why? 'Cause you don't have any actual proof yet, Chloe
All right? If you're wrong,
you get nothing and Tio knows we're onto him
Dan, I'm right I can feel it
Chloe, we'll look into Tio
But right now, you got to be patient
(chuckles softly)
(door closes)
Oh
(clears throat)
So, uh
has he got your necklace?
He claims to not know it's whereabouts
(school bell rings over TV, TV clicks off)
I suppose it's time to torture him
So, you're up (scoffs)
Look, just because I am the King of Hell
doesn't mean I actually do the torturing
I'm more of a delegator
But I assumed this was going to happen,
so I popped back down while you were in there
and brought up the best
You remember Mazikeen
Hello, human
(grunts)
Where am I?
Who are you?
I'm a demon
And I've risen from the bowels of Hell
to torture you I already told that other guy
I don't know nothing about Aiden Scott
(laughs)
That "other guy" wouldn't know a flanged mace
from this
stabbing object
I'm here for the truth
You don't have to do this
No
I get to do this
(grunts)
Asphyxiation? (shouts)
Electrocution?
There are so many ways
I could hurt you
I just can't decide
Wow
I'm on fire,
aren't you?
No
I thought Hell was hot
(exhales, growls)
Well, that human didn't kill anybody
(Tio crying in distance)
And he doesn't know where your stupid necklace is, either
Also a bit of a crier, it seems
I hope you didn't go too hard, Maze
He's not in Hell yet
Oh, no
Those are tears of joy
Oh, so he's a masochist
(chuckles)
They can be quite tricky
What did you use
to inflict the pain?
Nothing Hmm?
In Hell, I have to use their own guilt against them as torture
The method is chosen for them,
but here, Lucifer
(stammers)
infinite possibilities
I got so excited,
I just had sex with him
(groans)
(laughs): And then he wouldn't shut up
(laughs) Enough
That man tried to bribe me into throwing a fight, all right?
Now, he practically admitted doing the same with Aiden Scott,
so he must be lying to you
Nobody lies to me
The human said he wanted to fix
the dead one's fight, but someone beat him to it
Said someone placed a huge anonymous bet
Half a million dollars on Aiden Scott losing
AMENADIEL: Whoever placed that bet
probably killed Aiden Scott and stole my necklace
Tio doesn't know who that is, either
Said they only communicated anonymously
through burner phones and dead drops
So Tio has no idea who this man is,
and no way of finding out
Which basically means your so-called torture
has been useless
You want to go, bird boy?
Ooh, now this is getting interesting
Luci, we still need to find this thief
(sighs)
And you're not gonna
Very well
Whoever stole your necklace tried to gamble on a sure thing
So, maybe we could persuade our thief to gamble on another
So if we convince this killer thief
to bet on my fight instead,
and I take the fall I promise to take,
then we wait wherever the money is supposed to be dropped off,
and then we see who shows up
You are cleverer than you look
Maze, do you think you can persuade Tio to arrange that?
Where should I begin?
Excuse me-- oh, no, no I'm good Charlotte Richards
Hi I'm here regarding your client Tio Sorrento
ETIENNE: I'm sorry, Ms Richards, she just
Oh, it's fine, Etienne
I always have time for law enforcement
You are law enforcement, yes?
Yes, I, um I'm Officer Decker,
and I'm here to help Tio
And what makes you think that I need your help
representing my client? Hmm?
Uh, well, because we know he works for the Sarkisian family
Mm-hmm And he's also implicated
in the murder of Aiden Scott
So if he agrees to speak with us,
we'll go easier on him
Have you ever heard of something called "leverage,"
Officer Decker?
If not, let me help you
It's like pressure or influence,
and it's something that you currently can't apply,
because none of what you said actually resembles
proof of a crime
Why do you say that?
Because when you're out there writing traffic tickets,
I'm representing families like the Lings and the Sokolovs
Actual killers
Alleged, anyway
So it's going to take a lot more than spunk--
especially rookie spunk-- and a prayer to intimidate me
You represent the Sokolov family?
And you also represent
Tio and the Sarkisians
So, I-I thought the Sarkisians
and the Sokolovs were at war
over their bookmaking operations
I wonder how they'd feel if they knew
that their lawyer was double-dipping
(chuckles): You know, I'm-I'm new at this, so
I don't know what the term is for what you're doing,
but I think it's called "leverage"
Please have a seat, Officer
Aw, thank you
I didn't expect you to be so happy
to lose your first fight ever, Brother
And to a human, no less
Nice try, Luci, but we both know this doesn't count
Ah Not to mention the fact
that no mere mortal could ever stand a chance
against the full power of my God-given
Forget it I regret mentioning it
(music thumping, crowd cheering in distance)
(bell dings)
Looks like you might be up soon, Brother
Luci, thanks
What? Thanks for your help
I mean, I will admit that I was a bit skeptical
of your plan, but this might actually work
Yes, of course it'll work, Brother
That's why you asked me, remember?
Someone crafty, smart
And evil (laughs)
Evil?
Well, if you want to find a deplorable criminal,
you just ask a-- well, you know what I mean, Luci
Come on
You are the Devil, after all
*
ANNOUNCER (over PA): Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a scratch on the card
Please welcome a new fighter to the cage:
Lucifer
Morningstar!
(crowd cheering)
You wanted the Devil
Well, you got him
(bell dings) Where's the human fighter?
Off to join the Renaissance fair,
whatever that is
Apparently, he loves the mandolin
So that leaves you
with big bad me
Why are you doing this, Lucifer?
(chuckles): Well, who better than the Devil
to help you do something so wickedly dishonest
as to throw a fight?
(both grunt)
You're welcome, by the way This is pointless!
Well, we're finally answering the age-old question:
"Who'd win in a fight, you or me?"
This doesn't count!
So be it, Brother
So be it
*
(both grunting)
I'll make sure I tell everyone in Heaven and Hell
how the undefeated warrior lost
to his loser, evil, little brother (chuckles)
Oh, I guess you're not so tough after all, are you, eh?
Daddy's boy
(yells)
(crowd cheers)
See?
You're just as bad as me, Brother
Pride is your sin, too
(Lucifer yells)
*
(grunts)
Get up
(crowd groans)
What am I doing?
Fight me
No
You see, I won't stoop down to your level
Because I am better than you are
(crowd jeering)
(Lucifer grunts)
Fight me!
(stammers)
Winner by submission!
(crowd cheering and jeering)
It's been, like, two hours, Chloe
I seriously doubt Tio Sorrento's gonna show up
Especially now that he knows he's a suspect
in Aiden Scott's murder
He swore to Charlotte Richards
that he had nothing to do with the murder
and that he'd help us find the killer
So he's just gonna drop a bunch of cash off into a locker?
Yeah, if that's what's gonna clear his name
And whoever picks it up
either killed Aiden Scott or knows who did
And if you're wrong?
Tio doesn't show up,
he alerts his bosses about our investigation
Our entire case against them is destroyed
You know, going to see Charlotte Richards,
that was a big gamble
And I want you to make detective,
more than anyone,
but I'm worried that this is gonna set you back
I know
I know you are
But sometimes this job is about taking risks, right?
Besides, you know, my gut tells me I'm right
Most impressive, Brother, swallowing your pride like that
Hope you haven't spent too long on Earth
It seems to have softened you
Luci, I just hope whoever stole my necklace
won't take too long to pick up their winnings
The sooner I can grab him and retrieve it,
the sooner I can leave
I think we both
stayed here for far too long
Killer/necklace thief alert
Is that Gil,
the owner of the gym?
Yeah Ugh
All right, I'll arrest him
You grab Tio
CHLOE: Gil Drop the bag
(Gil screams)
Where's my necklace?
Where am I?
Who are you? What necklace?
The one you stole from me
Wait
That was you in the street?
H-How'd we get here?
We flew
Thought we needed a bit of privacy
Who are you?
And you, I-I-I shot you
And yet he's standing here alive
It's shocking, isn't it?
Look, I-I don't want any trouble
I'll get you a new necklace
No, see, I want mine
It's just a necklace What's the big deal about it?
Because my father gave it to me!
GIL (stammers): Look
Taking the necklace wasn't part of my plan
So you planned to kill the other human?
No, that was a mistake, too
Aiden was like a son to me
I got into some money trouble I thought of a fix
Aiden throws his fight
We bet on it, take home a huge payday
Both of us
But the fighter didn't want to play his part, did he?
He said he'd rather walk away from it than throw it
I went to try to scare him,
but Aiden fought back
I panicked, I shot him
Tried to make it look like a robbery
That's when I saw you
I-I didn't know what you'd seen, I'm sorry
I'm gonna ask you for the last time
Where
is my necklace?
It's in the gym
It's in my safe
Let's go drop him back at the beach
Just a moment
So you killed your so-called "son"
for refusing to play a part
in your plan
Now, that is just pure evil
And I should know
Because I am the King of Evil
No! No!
(air whooshes)
GIL: (screams) I did it!
(crying): I
(groans)
DAN: Where the hell did he come from?
I did it I-I killed Aiden Scott
I'm sorry, it's-it's all my fault
I I killed him
Sounds like a confession to me
Looks like your gamble paid off
(handcuffs clicking)
AMENADIEL: Luci, why are we back here?
It's time for us to leave
We've been here on Earth long enough
Yes, you see, that's what I wanted to talk to you about
(sighs)
I'm not leaving
(chuckles softly)
What?
I'm saying that I've realized something here
in this City of Angels
That I really am no longer one anymore
(laughs)
And if that's true,
then why am I still trying to please Father?
Eons-- eons-- spent condemned to my fate in Hell,
and yet I'm still trying to seek His approval
Still playing a part in His play
Well, no more, Brother
He abandoned me, so why shouldn't I abandon Him?
It's time I fully accept how everyone else sees me:
the rebel
As a wise woman once said to me,
"If you really want to rebel, move to LA"
Stop
Lucifer, as much as I am moved by your sentiment,
unfortunately, that's a no
You are coming back to Hell with me
There's no discussion
(sighs)
Yes, you see
this is where it gets interesting
We made a deal, didn't we,
for a favor to be named later
Later is now
And my ask, it's quite simple
Leave me be
You know I can't do that
Well, isn't it a sin for an angel to break a vow?
(sighs): Oh, Luci
Father will be furious
And you will suffer His wrath
Well
then He knows where to find me
("American Funeral" by Alex da Kid and Joseph Angel playing)

* Then they put me in handcuffs *

- Previously on Lucifer - CHLOE: I figured out that you're 
the one who grabbed the Sinnerman 
- I told you, I did this for us - For us
I had your back on this, and for whatever reason,
you still felt the need to go behind mine 
I just read the crime scene report, and holy burrito bowl!
Lopez, just stop talking!
MAZE: It was weird 
seeing you and Amenadiel so chummy
I don't want you two getting together
LINDA: I understand 
I can see why Lucifer's so affected by you
It's because you're special, Decker
LUCIFER: What if the Sinnerman 
was the one working for someone else?
The world's first murderer, marked by God 
and doomed to walk the Earth alone for a tortured eternity
It's quite the moniker Wouldn't you agree, Kane? 
[PIERCE SIGHS]
Thanks for the drink
Figured it's the least I could do
After all, I am the reason
you're leaking all over my floor
[SCOFFS]
Well, gosh, we have so much to catch up on, don't we, Kane?
Or would you prefer Mr Kane?
Make it sound official?
Let's just stick with Pierce
Very well
Why all the games, Pierce?
- No games - Oh, really?
Now you'll claim your arrival
- on my doorstep's simply coincidence? - No
I'm the one that had you knocked out and left in the desert
I see
That's all I did
So you're gonna blame everything else on your eyeless stooge?
He wasn't a stooge He was my right-hand man
Until you shot him dead
Excellent way to repay his loyalty, by the way
He went rogue
I have no idea why he did what he did
That's why I had to take him out
You know, for an immortal,
you really do bleed a lot, don't you?
Yeah
I'm still human I still feel
all the pain that comes with death
It's just the wounds heal
- Oh, sounds like a bitch - Yeah, well, I don't have to tell you
what sort of sick sense of humor your father has
Which is why I'm surprised that you're working with Him
Well, there's no sense in denying it now
I know
you gave me back my wretched wings
I know you took my devil face
So tell me, what did He offer you in return?
I would never work for your father
And I had nothing to do with your wings or your devil face
I don't believe you
I don't care
[GROANS]
Now, after getting stabbed
and killing the closest thing I had to a friend,
I've had a long day
Where do you think you're going?
[GROANS]
You can't just walk out on me
Or what? You'll kill me?
[GROANS]
I'll tell everyone who you really are!
Go ahead
They don't even believe you're the Devil
[SCOFFS]
[YELLS]
Maze, what the hell was that?
Testing a new blade
Making sure it's kill ready
It is
Maze, you can't just throw knives at Trixie's door
It's dangerous, and now we have to pay
- to have this fixed - Relax
I got it covered
Trixie's already working on
another one of her alien drawings
[KNIFE SCRAPING]
Is that why you've been putting up all of Trixie's artwork?
- To cover up the damage? - What?
Kid's got to make cash somehow
Seriously, Maze?
You live in a house with people
Is it too much to ask for just a little consideration?
[GASPS] This is that human thing
where you're mad about something else
but you're taking it out on me, right?
[SIGHS]
I'm sorry
I didn't mean to snap at you
I'm just, I'm-I'm upset about what happened with Lucifer
Ah
After everything he did Betraying me,
kidnapping a prisoner right under my nose
He hasn't even apologized yet
[LAUGHS] And?
And what? It's not funny
I trusted him enough to break the rules with him
He didn't care what happened to me
All right
Look, you're upset
I get it
But you have to understand, Chloe,
you're never gonna change Lucifer
He is who he is
Yeah
["WATCH 'EM FALL" BY BEASTS WITH NO NAME PLAYING]
- Previously on Lucifer - Hey, Lieutenant,
are you going somewhere?
I put in for a transfer
Maybe you don't have to go
As a thank you for watching Trixie,
maybe we can go grab that coffee sometime
Dinner would be more romantic
Did you know that Linda and Amenadiel are a thing?
So our old flames are having a fling
I don't care, why should you?
Unless you're still hot for angel
No!
You know, for an immortal,
you really do bleed a lot, don't you?
I'm still human I still feel
all the pain that comes with death
It's just the wounds heal
Do your thing Ask me
Kane
What is it that you desire?
To die
I will find a way to end your infinite misery
if it's the last thing I do
Lucifer?
Lucifer!
Hello, Lucifer?
If it were that easy to kill me,
I would have been dead a long time ago
Very well
Right, have you tried
- grenade down the throat? - Yes
- Acid bath? - Mm-hmm
- Devoured by wolves? - Yes
- Dropped into helicopter blades? - Mm-hmm
I've been trying to kill myself
since the Bronze Age
I have tried
everything
Even jumped into a volcano once
What, you survived molten lava?
Yeah, it was a rough six months Just, whatever I do, I just
regrow
Huh, like a blue-eyed, square-jawed tapeworm
So if I cut you exactly in half, would there be two Pierces?
No Only one side would heal
You see, I call it the, the "master molecule" theory
Yes, yes, Wolverine rules I get it
But
there must be some method that works
Lucifer, why do you care so much about this?
Because my Father laid a curse on you to live forever,
so killing you would be an epic loogie in the old man's eye
Well, you are the Devil
You must have something shockingly evil
up your sleeve
Mm, you mean, uh
- something like this? - Aah!
Ouch!
Thanks
You're most welcome
'Cause that little bad boy was forged in the bowels of Hell
Oh, yes, demon steel
Can kill even me, so
time to say good-bye to Hollywood, Pierce
Good-bye, Lucifer
No, I-I don't understand How does this not work?
I should have known
that you wouldn't be able to figure this out
Well, I mean, the good news is
we've got all the time in the world to do so
For me, that's a bad thing
Hey, Dan
- Hey - Thank you
I feel like I'm having déjÃ vu This street seems so familiar
Yeah, well, it should
We took a look at that house right there on the corner
Remember? Right after Trixie was born
Oh, yeah Great public schools, really safe neighborhood
Oh or not
June Lee, 34
Local chemistry teacher She lived right down the block
Forestry service left the wood chipper here overnight,
and someone took advantage
Did you get a chance to talk to any of the lookie-loos yet?
Nope
All yours
Okay
Hello
I'm Detective Decker
Who would do this to poor June?
Well, I'm hoping that you all could help me with that
Um did any of you hear
or see anything out of the ordinary this morning?
No I mean, I heard that wood chipper going, but
I didn't know
And did any of you know anyone
that would want to hurt June?
No
Everyone really loved her
She was very active in the community
We just got mani-pedis together
Mm, sorry
Ah, thank you for your help, Maze
No worries
This actually gives me time to brainstorm
a little problem of my own
Ah
So, this is for anything with wings
- Ooh - I grab them like this
And then I stab 'em with my blade
Right
This beauty
This is for anything with horns
Oh, goody
- So I hook 'em like this - Yeah
And then, bam!
Blade straight to the heart
Right, I'm just gonna stop you there
Do these grisly struggles
always end with you stabbing a victim with your blade?
My blades were forged in Hell
How else am I supposed to kill a celestial being?
Damn I already stabbed him with one of your blades
Well, I wish you would've told me that
before I hauled all this out of the basement
Nothing on Earth
Nothing from Hell
I mean, there must be some way to snuff this candle
Well
Decker makes you killable, right?
- Hmm - Why don't you
see what's going on there?
Rub some of that on Pierce
Apples to oranges, Maze
What's going on there
is just a cruel joke from Dad
And what's going on with Pierce isn't?
Your Father
is all about mind games and loopholes, remember?
Yes, perhaps you're right, Maze
Maybe I should find out what makes Pierce vulnerable
Get inside his head
Not with the cranial saw
Well, not yet
anyway
Why is my couch in the middle of my office?
Oh, good You're here
Please, take a seat
How are you feeling today?
What are you doing?
Oh, answering a question with another question
That's called "evasion"
All right,
and your body language suggests you're quite upset
No, I'm just not a fan of your redecorating
That's awfully passive-aggressive
of you, Pierce Why don't you tell me how you really feel?
Get out of my office
Good, good Anger
That's called a breakthrough, yeah
Oh Don't worry
This is a safe place
Why are you doing this?
Well, how am I supposed
to solve the mystery of how to kill you
if I don't understand you first?
Your strengths, your weaknesses
Because everyone has a Kryptonite, Lieutenant
So in other words, you still have no idea how to kill me?
But this is the idea
I'm not a crier
I'm not a sharer
So unless you have something that's case-related,
we're done talking
And turn my desk around
Decker
Please tell me you're working
on something interesting
Pierce
Lieutenant, you're still here
D-Does that mean
you've decided to stay, or?
Yeah
At least for now
Oh, that's great
That's really, really great
Two really's? Really?
Yeah, just 'cause
I have a twist in my case, and I could use your help
So the suburban wood chipper victim,
we recovered a finger, ran a print
Turns out June Lee isn't June Lee
It's a false identity?
Our vic's real name is Sandra Jang,
and according to public record, she died three years ago
Fascinating You know,
the lieutenant has a lot of experience in fake deaths
You must mean because I came up through
Missing Persons in Chicago
Hmm
Oh, great We could really use
your experience on this, then
Yes, I, too, would love to learn everything
about your experience
Sure
Decker, why don't you pull
the original death certificate There might be something there
You got it
I know what you're trying to do
If you mean solve a mystery, then yes
And with you and I working on this case together,
it'll kill two mysteries with one stone, hmm?
Emphasis on the kill, of course
Oh
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
So if we can figure out why
Sandra faked her death three years ago,
it might point to her killer
In my experience, people who fake their own death
are running from something or someone
Right, something or someone that scares them,
makes them feel vulnerable
Any experience of that in your own life, Lieutenant?
Sandra definitely could've been running
- Check her rap sheet - Possession of narcotics
and distribution
Mm-hmm For a gang called the Korean Power
Oh, not your typical gangbanger
Uh, that's 'cause she's not a gangbanger
She's some kind of a chemist
Tech unlocked Sandra's laptop,
found, uh, recipes for synthetic chemical compounds
all filed under the label "KPOP"
It's a kind of music,
- right? - Oh, dear
Poor Daniel, so behind the times
K-Pop is a kind of Ecstasy
It's one of the best kinds, actually
Wait, so Sandra wasn't
dealing for the gang, she was cooking for them
I wonder if K-Pop is still on the market?
Oh, well, it was as of last Tuesday
It's wonderful stuff
Yeah, it makes your skin feel like a baby chinchilla
And as a nightclub owner,
you might know where to find some?
Oh, absolutely Yes, and I'd be happy to guide you
on your roll, Detective
Though I would wait till you have
a day off to recover
- I'm not - You want to squeeze a dealer
Right, and work our way up the chain to the Korean Power,
maybe find Sandra's killer
There are dozens of homicides tied to the gang
Okay, one Ecstasy dealer coming right up
You two can meet me at Lux in an hour
- Sure - Right Daniel?
- Yeah? - You can stay
Oh, here's one
Some idiot named Ben Simpson
Absconded in a stolen ice cream truck
Six-five Aggravated assault
with a blowtorch Snore
Don't you clowns have anything challenging?
What is that?
Do you smell that?
Axe Body Spray
Oh, hello Uh, do I know you?
Used to
I'm Lucifer's friend
Oh, so we're friends?
Hell no
You were a monstrous bitch
and I hated you We were mortal enemies
Right I get that a lot
Yeah, but now something's different
It's
wonderful
And Lord knows I could use a distraction
Oh, well, I have been trying to make changes
You know, new leaf and all
Hasn't been easy,
but I'm glad it's finally starting to
come through
Oh, something's coming through all right
Oh
You smell incredible
What, um, exactly did you say our relationship was?
Shh Don't talk
I've got to go hog-tie a fugitive
in an ice cream truck right now
But I will definitely be back
Where's Pierce?
He said he was coming
Well, he's probably busy at the precinct
And if you're worried
about him being checked out, relax
He's sticking around L A For a while
I kind of convinced him to stay
Oh, don't be foolish
The man's clearly staying for me
Turns out we have quite a bit in common
Right So, back to reality, where we have a case to solve,
where is this dealer you promised?
Two house specials, please
Lucifer, you know I don't drink on the job
Here you go Two house specials
Your bartender is a drug dealer?
What, you think I hired him for abs alone?
Where'd you get the K-Pop?
I get it from the Korean Power
Best "E" in town, or used to be
Sad but true
Previously hangover free, but now in the morning,
your mouth's like Gandhi's flip-flop
Hmm, what changed?
Their cook
The gang used to have some genius lady chemist,
but I heard she got greedy
- She stole from the Korean Power? - Yup
Big, powerful, scary, boss dude,
and she pilfered right from under his nose
Huh
Pretty ballsy
I mean, not that I would ever
Yes, yes, get on with it
So, the boss put a hit out on her, did he?
Yeah, but her lab blew up before they could get to her
- Freak accident - Accident?
Do you know this boss' name or where we can find him?
Yeah Brandon Hong
He likes to hang out at this one karaoke spot
over on Irolo
But these guys don't mess around
Right, well, mmm
off we go, Detective
What? Off we go to where?
To the karaoke parlor, talk to a gang leader
Maybe do a duet if you're feeling adventurous
We have to verify this testimony with Vice
We have to get a warrant,
assemble a SWAT team
You know, actually plan to do a gang takedown
Right Is that the sort of thing
the lieutenant would get involved in?
No, Pierce will not get involved until we bring him a suspect
Which is why we should just go to the parlor
and skip to that part
Lucifer, this is a ruthless drug lord
with who knows how many armed thugs?
You can't just walk in there with your three-piece suit
and say: "Hello, drug dealers"
I would never do that
_
Come out, come out wherever you are
- And who are you? - I'm Lucifer
Morningstar But don't worry, I'm here alone
The police raid won't happen for a few more hours
Police raid?
Yes So as you can see, I'm in a bit of a rush
Could you point me to the bigger gun?
- Your boss? - Get rid of him
What is it with people trying to avoid me today?
Previously on Lucifer
Kane is alive
You know, for an immortal,
you really do bleed a lot, don't you?
PIERCE: I still feel all the pain that comes with death, 
just the wounds heal 
AMENADIEL: I am a soldier of God 
His favorite son
Oh, that's gonna be a thing, isn't it?
It was weird
seeing you and Amenadiel so chummy
It makes me feel left out 
I'm missing time
It's like someone else was living my life 
I've been pretending like I remember it all
because otherwise, everyone would think that I'm crazy 
My Dad screwed us both
But perhaps there's a way for us to screw Him back
If we're gonna kill you, 
we have got to do it together
["THE ANSWER" BY AQUAMOAN PLAYING]
Previously, on Lucifer
Someone is forcing those wings on me
I'm sure it's all a part of God's plan
If you mean His plan to continually
manipulate and control me, then agreed
I really appreciate how you handled the whole
"me not wanting you and Amenadiel to bone" thing
I do really like you
You can't die, I know But I promise you,
I will find a way to end
your infinite misery
if it's the last thing I do
Thank you for your help, mate
No worries This actually gives me time
to brainstorm a little problem of my own
Aah!
I don't understand How does this not work?
You still have no idea how to kill me
Lucifer, I'm here
Are you ready?
Lucifer?
Why is it so dark in here?
Wha?
Lucifer?
Lucifer?
Detective
There's been a change of plan I'm not going
What? But we have a case
Something's happened Please leave
Wait, what's happened? Are you okay?
I can't
I can't make them go away
Wha?
Lucifer,
- what's on your back? - Detective,
I said leave!
What's going on?
I can't
I can't control them
No! Detective!
Detective!
Detective, grab my hand!
Detective!
No!
No
No!
And then I woke up
And it's not the sort of dream I'm used to
A lot less nudity
So what do you think it means?
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
what it means, Lucifer
That I need sturdier guardrails?
Or, maybe there's some symbolism in there
- You mean my wings, don't you? - Yes
Well, clearly, you have issues
Well, you would, too,
if your father slapped
a pair on your back
Took away your Devil face, took away who you are
I mean, who knows what else He'll take from me
Lux? My job with the LAPD?
Or Chloe
Well, she may be part of it, but this isn't about her
This is about me
So can we please just focus on what truly matters here?
- Which is? - Showing my Father
that He can't control me
And He's not as powerful as he thinks
And how are you going to do that?
By defying Him
I'm gonna remove Pierce's immortal curse
so he can finally die
There's just one problem, though
Just one?
Everything that I've come up with,
Pierce has already tried
I'm completely out of ideas
My well is dry, and that is why I'm here
Yeah, well
Not sure I know how to remove an immortal's curse
No
I need you to remove my mental block
Hypnotize me, or something
I hear it works with smoking and insomnia, so
Unfortunately, that's not how it works, Lucifer
There's no easy fix for a lack of ideas
No?
No
You just have to be patient
You never know when or where inspiration will strike
Well, thank you, Doctor
For being completely unhelpful today
Ah
Hi, Amenadiel
Hey, Ella?
Um
Uh, listen, about tonight?
- I'm gonna have to - No!
No
You better not be cancelling on me again
I know, I'm so sorry
It's just, I have so much work to do
Can't you play hooky?
Not if I want to be
a responsible adult
Right
But
What if
you weren't a responsible adult?
Just this once
Come on!
Chloe,
I mean, don't you ever miss just having stupid fun
like when you were a kid?
I was a pretty grown-up kid, actually
Well, never too late to start
I know I'm sorry, babe, I can't
Can we do a neon party rain check?
Decker, one of these days,
you're gonna realize what you've been missing
It looked so cute on you
This is the longest you've ever gone without talking
Ever Is something on your mind?
Nothing
That's the problem
Uh, how so?
Well, I
I have this puzzle that I need to solve,
but I've hit a mental block
- Okay - Have you ever just
ran out of ideas when working
a particularly difficult case?
I mean, before I came along, of course
Right
Um not really
I-I mean, I've hit dead ends
from lack of evidence,
but no, because there's always a new angle to consider
Braggart
Our victim's name was Kathleen Pike, 33
She's the author of a best-selling
futuristic YA series
called Class of 3001
She was found with her head bashed in
by her own vintage typewriter

Or on the head, should I say?
What's that white stuff?
I know what you guys are thinking
She's a synthetic

The android who bled white
No one? Really? Oh, never mind
That's melted ice cream, anyway
It looks like our victim was about to dig in last night
when someone showed up and rewrote her dessert menu
with that typewriter
Real wound's over here though
Huh Who found the body?
Kathleen's editor Vincent Green
He's out by the pool
Thank you
Uh, Daniel
- Your head is mostly empty - Huh?
Exactly And yet, you manage to do this improv thing
How do you come up with stuff on the spot like that?
Well, the first rule of improv is "yes, and"
Yes and what?
That's the name of the technique
Right I've heard you talk about it before,
but I don't actually understand what it means
Well, you agree with whatever's being said yes
And then you say the first thing that comes to your mind and
That makes no sense
But I'm desperate, so I'll try anything
Yes, and
I got the call from Kathleen late last night
She finally finished the new book
We made plans for me to come over this morning,
pick up the manuscript
Do you usually pick up manuscripts in person?
With Kathleen, yes
There's only ever one hard copy
since she does all her writing on that typewriter
Yes, and well, her dying
on that typewriter as well, it seems
Do you know anyone who would have done this to her?
Any known enemies?
No, Kathleen was extremely well-liked
She had millions of devoted fans
Ugh, I know how fans can get obsessed with their idols
Yes, and with their boobs
Like after you did Hot Tub High School, Detective
- Oh Uh-huh - You don't think
this could be my fault, do you?
- Why? - I was so excited that she was finished
that I tweeted the news to her fans
I really talked the book up, hinting at this huge
action-packed robot rebellion ending she teased me with
Well, as long as you didn't tweet her address as well
No, of course not, but someone could find that
Someone who wanted to read the book first?
Yes, and someone who wanted to tell her
that robot rebellions couldn't be more dull and derivative
What is with all this "yes, and" stuff?
Oh, just some improv thing I was hoping
would knock me out of my idea dry spell
But you're literally just saying what you would normally say,
with the words "yes, and" in front of it
Yes, and it's clearly not working
- Uh-uh - Stupid Daniel
Idea dry spell
Just like Kathleen
What do you mean?
She had the worst case of writer's block I've ever seen
Took her five years to figure out how to end the series
Well, never mind that How did she cure her block?
I don't know, she said I would understand after I read it
Said she even explained how she broke through it
in the book's afterword
But you haven't read it
No, like I said, there's only one copy
and I haven't seen it
Detective
This afterword could explain how
to overcome my own form of writer's block
- What? - We need to find it
The killer You mean we need to find the killer
Exactly So they can hand over that book
Uh-huh

Mmm Linda, I have to say,
these last few weeks have been absolutely incredible
Wow
You're really good at this sweet, sappy stuff, aren't you?
I feel the same
Good
Well, maybe someday
we can actually have this date in public?
I do hate sneaking around, but Maze
I know I know She can't find out
I
I want to tell her, I just don't know how
I admit, I'm afraid
Well, you should be Maze would
not take this well
I feel so guilty, I
I've been avoiding her calls
Are we being cowards?
Yes
But, Linda, it's
- Maze - Maze I know
Do you know how she's doing?
I'm sure she's fine
Busy hunting bounties and all
But
I can check on her if that'll make you feel better
Really? Just to make sure she's okay
Of course
I would do anything for you
What? Is that too sappy?
"Max was plagued with confusion
"If Jessica truly loved him, then why'd she kiss Tristan?
"And in the back seat of her flying car, no less"
This has sold millions of copies
Tongueless kissing and stealing liquor from their parents
I mean, where's the sex? The drugs?
That robot rebellion cannot come soon enough
Was your high school experience this pathetically PG?
I didn't have much of a high school experience
Oh! Played hooky a lot did you?
Suddenly I like you more
No, child actors don't have much time for regular school
You're either auditioning or on set,
- so it's mostly tutors - Ah
Maybe I did miss out on a lot
Anyhow, why are you reading those?
I doubt that that's gonna
lead us to Kathleen's killer
Oh, well, Kathleen's afterword explained
how she overcame her writer's block
In order to understand, I may need context
Oh, in case she uses examples?
Exactly So, speaking of the killer,
any leads?
Yeah, actually
Someone who goes by the name of
"Ashley3001fan"
Got into some pretty heated online arguments with Kathleen
Apparently, she wasn't too happy
the book was taking so long to be completed
Poor Kathleen When will people understand writer's block
is a very serious condition?
Well, Kathleen agreed
"I don't have to answer
to ignorant trolls like you
There's a reason I'm the writer
and you're a fan
Maybe you should try contributing
something to society"
Ouch, nicely put, Kathleen
Yeah After Kathleen publicly berated her,
Ashley went completely offline
You think Ashley was so humiliated by her hero
that she wanted revenge?
It's possible
Well, let's hope so 'cause I need to find that boo
Killer, the b killer
I know you mean book
I did
Hi, Amenadiel
Hey, Trixie Uh, is Maze here?
Sorry, no
Oh
Would you mind telling her that I stopped by, please?
Sure
Thanks
Nice work, Trix
Why don't you want to see him?
Amenadiel's nice
Nice?
If he were nice,
he wouldn't be sneaking around behind my back with my friend,
and lying about it
Why are they doing that?
I don't know 'Cause they suck
Mommy says that sometimes,
people are just scared to tell the truth
Maybe they need a little help
That's not a bad idea, kid
Helping people tell the truth is kind of my thing
Huh
I cybertraced Ashley3001fan to here
And the ice cream from the crime scene,
also from here
- Ashley could be one of these three - Yes
They do seem like the insipid YA type
Though, scooping frozen treats for others day in, day out,
seems even more boring
Yeah, but they get to hang out with their friends
There's no adult responsibility
It looks like they're having fun
You know, stupid fun
Since when do you like "stupid fun"?
Hi
Detective Decker, LAPD I'd like to ask you all some
- Freeze - Ha
"Freeze," good one
Please
Please don't call my mom
I-It's just one joint
Claire? What's going on?
Claire?
You're not Ashley?
No, I'm Ashley
Ashley's a man?
Yeah, I'm a man
And I'm the manager What's going on?
Oh, what's going on, Ashley,
is you need to give me that book
Otherwise, I'll show you the true meaning of
"you scream for ice cream"
Okay?
All right
I'm gonna ask you nicely, Ashley
Where's the book?
Dude, I'm telling you I don't have any book
Then why was that found at Kathleen Pike's home?
"3000 and Yum"
Yeah, that's a flavor I created special for Kathleen
I brought it to her house personally
Do you always bring ice cream to your murder victims?
Murder?
Wait
Kathleen's dead?
Very
Man, she was the greatest
writer of our generation
What?
Her books were about high school drama
What could a man of your age possibly find great about them?
I mean, high school was the best time of my life
Reading 3001 makes me feel like I'm 16 again
Those books are deeper than you think
We know about your online fight with Kathleen
Things got very heated
Must've hurt to have her insult you like that
in front of everybody
I never should've said those things
So, I sent her some of my writing
You know, like an olive branch
Hold on, you're a writer?
Yeah, man I've written, like,
tons of Class of 3001 fan fiction
Can't imagine that Kathleen was too pleased
Kathleen liked my writing
She even asked me to help her finish her last book
She asked you to help?
So Kathleen's solution to writer's block was to outsource?
Yeah, but when Kathleen read my version,
she decided she wanted to go in a different direction
But she said it did help her f-finish her book on her own
So boom
It did? How?
What exactly helped Kathleen overcome her block?
She told me she realized
she needed to be more authentic
You know, get back to her original inspiration
That is completely meaningless
Well, well, what was the original inspiration?
Oh? You guys don't know?
So, the characters in Kathleen's books are based on real people
And all of her stories were taken
from her real life at Westside High,
right here in LA
Max, Jessica, Isabel
She didn't even change any of the first names
Did she have any original ideas at all?
Well, she changed the last names
And she did have to come up
with all that futuristic sci-fi stuff
I mean, trust me, that is not easy
I'm actually writing my own book
about a forensic scientist
- who talks to ghosts - You are? Tell me,
what do you do when you run out of ideas?
Oh, I never run out of ideas I've got way too many
My problem is how to choose
Well, there's no need to rub it in
- Thank you - So, this author exposed
all these people's dirty laundry?
Sounds like motive to me
Uh, I think Charlotte
uh, Ms Richards is right
If, uh, someone saw the editor's tweet
announcing another book, then maybe one of them killed her
to make sure it didn't come out
Ella
The main characters
from the Class of 3001
If the book's gonna reveal any secrets, it's theirs
These are our suspects
Right Prom king, sexpot, cheerleader,
bad boy, valedictorian, jock
One of these six degenerates has my book Let's bring them in
No, all you have is speculation Not enough for arrest warrants
I mean, even if we did bring them all in,
we don't have any leverage Why would they
admit to anything?
Well, according to superfan Ashley,
Kathleen was rushing to get her book done in time
to announce it at her high school reunion,
which is tomorrow night
Well, if all our suspects
are in town to attend,
gave them opportunity
Mm-hmm And it gives us an opportunity as well,
to go undercover
- Well, good What are we waiting for? - Well,
it's a high school reunion Everybody knows everybody
Unless you're Todd Cornwell
Who's Todd Cornwell?
Exactly Todd Cornwell
Class loner, acne,
Coke-bottle glasses, whole bit
Went to college overseas,
and when I stalked Kathleen's classmates online,
Todd was the only one with zero social media presence
Lucifer, you could go as Todd
Yeah, no, no, seriously Look, he looks just like you
Has all that masturbation finally caught up
with your eyesight, Daniel?
No one'll believe that even if I tell them
I've had a face and body transplant
Yeah, but it might be our only shot
I mean, I could go as your plus-one
Oh, poops Hold up
Todd RSVP'd "yes"
Charlotte, is there any legal way
to prevent him from attending?
Well, it's definitely not legal
to distract Todd with, say, a bounty hunter
If anyone needs me, I'm gonna be in my office
not hearing the plan
Okay, great Are you gonna call Maze?
Gladly, whilst you research our suspects
Enjoy
Maze
I'm so glad you're here
Yeah, well, you seem pretty busy
I called a couple of times Never heard back
Yeah, I know, work's been crazy
Oh I was hoping that maybe you found a boyfriend
- Boyfriend? - Yeah
Why would I
Definitely no boyfriend
- Really? - Yup
So single So so single
Well, in that case, I should totally set you up
I have just the guy
Oh, that it so thoughtful of you, Maze,
but you really don't have to do that
Please, Linda, I want to What are best friends for?
I know, it's just me and blind dates
- How about tomorrow night? - Tomorrow night?
Oh shoot I think I'm busy
Let me do this
Tomorrow it is
No
Mom?
Baby, what are you doing up? Get back in bed
Bed? It's morning
I'm gonna miss the bus
What?
I've-I've, uh
I've been up all night?
Come on, come on Get the
Get-get, go, get your Where's the?
Oh
Wow
You know, high school reunion's
a very popular torture in Hell
This is beautiful
I you know, you didn't even try to look like Todd
Well well, why would I do that?
If I was Todd, I'd want to look like me
Oh, my gosh Oh, my gosh, look
It's Emily and Bo,
Tristan and Jessica,
and there's Max talking to Isabel
She is so not good enough for him, really
What did you just say?
Max and Isabel, two of our suspects
Oh, oh!
The prom king and the sexpot
Oh, Lucifer, don't judge
They're so much more to these people
than their stereotypes suggest
Right
It's just, ugh
Are you being serious?
Yeah Yeah, the books are much deeper
than you'd imagine
The characters, they're so compelling and relatable
and rich, and I-I mean
They're all here
And one of them is most likely a killer
Right
- Right - Right
Okay, I'm gonna go sign us in
so that we can finally meet the, um
so we can question the suspects
What is happening?
Okay, so we each have three people to question
Let's figure out who was worried about
Kathleen's book coming out
Yes, and where everyone was the night of the murder
Oh, yeah
Are you even listening to me?
- Mm-hmm - Do you know,
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but focus, Detective
I need that afterword
- Right, sorry - Right
- Oh, my God - What?
It's Jessica
Can you believe
that sophomore year, she hooked up with Tristan
on the laserball field?
Don't worry, Jessica's on my list
Okay, so, I'm the first one here
I'll just go have a drink at the bar
- Sure thing - Linda
Amenadiel, what are you doing here?
Well, Maze invited me
I thought she wanted to talk after I stopped by yesterday
Maze is setting me up on a blind date
What if you are my blind date?
Well, that doesn't make any sense
Unless she knows about us and is trying to make us squirm
And torture is her thing
Linda,
this is Todd
Your date
Hello
This is a blue lobelia
Native Americans used them to treat constipation
Thank you
But what are you two doing here?
Double date
Isn't this great?
Hmm
Yeah, uh, no
Hi
That's great
Excuse us Isabel
Todd?
Odd-bod Todd?
Are
I'm sorry You
just look so different
I'll take that as a compliment
Wow, I
Do you have a British accent?
Well, I've had many accents over the years,
but this one is clearly the best
You're so funny and so hot
- I know - Mmm
Uh, but I need to ask you a few questions
Sure Let's catch up
Can you believe Kathleen's coming out with another book?
Oh, I believe it
That bitch loved profiting off of us
Ugh, she sucks
But honestly, we're all, uh, just trying to move on
Man, those books ruined our lives
I had to move to Maine
Do you know what was in her last book?
What sparked her final idea?
The books are about you, correct?
- Oh, for - So, do you know
what happens in the new book?
Are there any big secrets
that come out or
Does Isabel actually get pregnant?
Uh, who are you again?
What were you doing two nights ago?
I was at home?
Doing a facial
I was with Tristan
I think
I mean, by the time I flew in, it was really late
You're hiding something
And I think I know what
It's because you were with Bo,
and you didn't want Isabel to find out
But, like, who cares what Isabel thinks?
Especially after what she did to you in chemistry class?
I mean, do you realize you're still lucky to have your hand?
It doesn't matter where I was two nights ago
What matters is that tonight, we're together
So where were you two nights ago?
Let's go talk somewhere a little quieter
Right
Yeah, talk Uh-huh
You two have so much in common
Yeah
Linda, you're a therapist
And, Todd,
you're in therapy
Discuss
Oh
- You don't have to - I wet the bed
It's more common than people think
You're lovely
I'm so glad she convinced me to skip my reunion for this
Most serial killers wet the bed
I smell a love connection, don't you?
Let's crank this date up a notch
Waiter
Linda
This is getting out of control
We just have to get through tonight We can do it
So, Todd
Any hobbies?
I make my own toothpaste
Where were you two nights ago?
Uh
Come on, Tristan
I can't remember
Well, try
I told you, man,
I don't, I don't remember where I was
Oh!
Tell me the truth now
Okay A couple nights ago,
we all broke into the school pool
You know, just a little party before the party, you know?
Well, why is that a secret?
Because we didn't invite everyone
Well, you, for instance
What? I'm sorry, man
If we knew how cool you had gotten,
we totally would've invited you
So what you're saying is you all have the same alibi?
Wasting our time here
Where's the detective?
I dig you, Chloe
You you're different
Too bad you didn't go to high school with us
Yeah
That would have been great
Yeah
So, you were gonna tell me
where you were two nights ago?
Is that really what you want to talk about, hmm?
Well, I mean,
I would really like to know
Max!
What are you doing? Who is that?
- Uh - We were talking
And what do you care?
You cheated on Max with Tristan
That was 15 years ago
- Actually, I am still kind of pissed - Right
- about that - I'm sorry I cheated on you,
but I only did it because I thought you slept with Emily
I would never cheat on you, Jessica
I know that now
I read 3001
It showed me how much you really loved me
You know, sometimes I think about
getting back together
Mmm
Me, too
Oh
What's going on here?
Max, I thought it was gonna be just us
I'm not really down for a four-way
Make that five
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm not down, either
- Oh So you were sleeping with Emily - Oh
Weren't you? And then you bring this rando in here, too?
- I'm not a "rando" - I-I just met
- this rando - We are never
- Hey - getting back together
- You didn't tell her about us? - Jessica, I
- Us? - Yes, us
- That's what you said - I never said
- Oh, really, Max? - Anything like that to you
Detective! None of these people killed Kathleen
- What? - "Killed"?
- What? - "Detective"?
I have discovered that they all
have the same alibi
They broke onto the campus two nights ago
and had a party by the pool
Didn't you? Hmm?
So, Kathleen's killer, not here
Look at me, being the responsible one
So that's why you were all acting so strangely
Yeah
Sorry we didn't invite you, Todd, but, uh
you're not mad, right?
You were hanging out with Kathleen anyway
What?
Todd was hanging out
with Kathleen two nights ago?
Yeah, it's what he said in the e-mail
I did? I
What? He was an awesome math tutor,
and now he helps me with my taxes
Detective
I think I'm the killer
Apparently, Maze took Todd to a steakhouse in Hollywood
It is an odd place for a kidnapping, even for Maze
And what motive would Todd have to kill Kathleen?
- He's not even in the books - Well, exactly
Odd-bod Todd's probably tired of being left out
Oh, right, should have thought of that
Yes, you should have,
but someone was making the case all about themselves
Slightly unprofessional, but I forgive you, Detective
I know I can't believe I let myself
get so wrapped up in all of that
Think I was just trying to make up
for all the fun, teenage drama that I missed out on, you know?
I didn't even get to go to my own prom
It's ridiculous, I know
No, it's not
And that's the best way to clean out an abscessed tooth
How delightful
I am so glad we did this
I have missed you guys
I mean
what's not to miss, right?
Mmm
- Mmm - Okay, stop
Uh, that's inappropriate
We're in a restaurant, Maze
Who cares?
I care I mean, I'm just
it ju it just makes me uncomfortable
Oh, it does?
Well, does this make you uncomfortable, too?
Maze!
Maze! Why are you acting like this?
Because she knows
You know, don't you?
And you're torturing us
That is so incredibly mean
I'm the one who's mean?
You're the ones who've been running around,
lying to me about this fling for weeks
Of course we lied, Maze Look at you
You have a tendency to overreact
I do not
- overreact - Maze
- Can we just calm down here? - No!
No
I will not take orders from some pathetic daddy's boy
Tell me, Amenadiel
Is this the divine purpose your Father sent you here for?
So you can bang
some selfish human?
Selfish? Selfish?
All I do is listen to your problems!
Everyone's problems!
So, yeah, for once, I put myself first
and did what makes me happy
So, sue me Or torture me Or better yet,
why don't you just skewer me with one of your knives?
But before you do,
know that this wasn't some fling,
that what Amenadiel and I found
was completely unexpected,
but 100% real
But you were my friend
Maze?
LAPD, drop the weapons
Yes, I indeed visited Kathleen two nights ago
The night she was murdered
Kathleen was murdered?
Oh, my
And y-you think I did it
Of course you do
The weirdo
The outcast
I'm used to people judging this book by its cover
That's why I swore off social media
I still don't even know how Kathleen tracked me down
Kathleen tracked you down?
She wanted to discuss
the final installment of her series with me
Well, why would she talk about that with you?
You're not even in the books
Yeah I was surprised, too
Turns out, not only was she going to include me
in the final book,
she was making me the hero
Wait, h-hold on, does that mean she let you read the book?
Uh, no
She didn't want me to read it yet
Kathleen was waiting for the reunion
She was excited about finishing it in time
to show everyone there
So you have no idea what's in the afterword?
The afterword? No
But she did tell me about the story itself
How it had
a peaceful, grounded ending
No scandals, no insiders versus outcasts
Just
people finally understanding each other
The way she described it, it
it sounded beautiful
- And boring - And not at all like
the action-packed robot ending
that the editor told us about
I smell a new theory brewing
I got to go make a phone call
Mr Green
Hi, uh, Detective Decker, LAPD
Detective, how can I help you?
Um, I was just wondering,
did Kathleen ever talk to you
about working with a ghostwriter?
A ghostwriter? No, wish she had
Maybe she would have finished the book sooner
Oh, I see
So-so, she never mentioned a-a fan-fic writer
named Ashley Collins?
He's a-a manager at an ice cream shop
I think the name's Scoop Science
Actually, yeah, Kathleen did mention some sort
of overeager fan who invented some special flavor for her
Kind of creeped her out
Wh-Why are you asking?
Is this Ashley a suspect?
Oh, well, I can't divulge any of that information at this time
But you've been incredibly helpful, Mr Green
Thank you
You in the mood for some ice cream?
Hello, Vincent
Looking for Ashley? Sorry to disappoint
- What are you doing here? - Drop the gun
You're under arrest for the murder of Kathleen Pike
You lied to us, Vincent
I called Ashley He confirmed
that the robot ending was his version and not Kathleen's
- Th-That means nothing - But it is suspicious
So I looked at traffic footage
You went to Kathleen's house the night of the murder
But, Detective, didn't he tell us he didn't go
over there till the next morning?
Fine Yes, I was at Kathleen's that night
If you had waited five years for that damn book like I did,
you wouldn't want to wait another second for it either
But once you got it, you didn't like what you read,
- did you? - I was horrified
She ended the series in the most boring way possible
And you were worried about the sales
We'd lose millions
without the right ending Ashley's
So you and Kathleen argued over which one to use
She refused to use the good version
So, yeah, I threw her stupid typewriter at her
But even with Kathleen gone, you knew
that you couldn't publish Ashley's ending as hers
So you came here to tie up the one loose end
Now, tell me, Vincent
Kathleen's manuscript,
where is it?
I don't have it
I destroyed it
You did what?
I couldn't let anybody read that pathetic joke of an ending!
But I needed to read the afterword
so I could fix my problem,
- and now you're saying it's gone?! - Lucifer,
back off
What did it say?
- The afterword? - Yes!
How did she fix her block?
I don't know! She said inspiration came
when she realized she couldn't go back
and change what she'd done
Well, that doesn't help me at all!
Lucifer, stop!
Now I'm never gonna figure out how to
Are you okay?
No, Detective
Far from it
Remind me to never go on another blind date ever again
Mm-mm Oh, I don't know,
I thought you and Todd really made a connection
Okay, so I've been thinking
- Yeah - A lot
Pretty crazy what Maze did
I'll say
But she was right
We never should have lied to her
And I never should have lied to myself
Yourself?
What do you mean?
As much as I tried to tell myself otherwise,
I knew what we were doing was going to hurt her
And I did it anyway
That's how much I wanted to be with you, Amenadiel
Look, you've made me happier than I've been
in a long, long time
But
I was being selfish
Maze is my friend
I can't be with you anymore
Not when it does this to her
You know, it's not fair for her to take this away from us
I know I don't expect you to understand
But I don't want to be that kind of person
It's just not who I am
Actually, I do understand
Um
I may have strayed from who I am as well
So I guess this is it
I guess so
Lucifer!
I'm here
- You wanted to see me? - Yes,
I wanted to check on you
That you were back to being the good detective
"The good detective"?
Mm Well, I like our partnership much better
when you do all the work and I'm the fun, irresponsible one
Oh Yeah
I did get a little carried away at that reunion
Just a smidge
Y-You know, it made me realize something
All of that high school drama that I missed out on
The-the girly gossip,
the hallway crushes,
all those school dances
That's just not who I am I
I like being the responsible adult
Right
So you no longer desire any of that high school poppycock?
No
Well then
I guess you won't be wanting this
Detective
will you go to the prom with me?
I can't believe you did this
Thank you, Lucifer
I'm just glad you got what you needed
But you, you never found that inspiration
that you were looking for
Are you ever gonna tell me what it is you were trying to solve?
Uh, it's-it's complicated
Well, tell me anyhow?
Very well
A long time ago,
dear old Dad put a curse on a
well, a friend of mine
And I want to break that curse,
show my Father He's not as powerful as He thinks,
that He can't control him
Or me
Well, crazy metaphor aside,
can I offer some advice?
Oh please
If I've learned anything from this experience,
it's that it's better to move forward
than stay stuck in the past
It's just like Kathleen realized
We can't rewrite history
You can't
But maybe I can
Detective, you're a genius
Thanks?
You've just given me my idea
All I need to do is go back
and undo the reason it exists in the first place
Oh
Thank you

Previously, on Lucifer
My dad screwed us both
But perhaps there's a way
- for us to screw him back - How?
By killing you
- Amenadiel's nice - If he were nice,
he wouldn't be sneaking around behind my back with my friend, 
and lying about it
You know, don't you?
You're the ones who have been
lying to me about this fling for weeks
I'd like to try and help
You don't have to treat me
I think I do For both of us
LUCIFER: In my quest to help you die, 
I've done some research
I've read every book,
I've analyzed every language 
LUCIFER: I'm completely out of ideas 
We can't rewrite history
Detective, you're a genius
You've just given me my idea
LUCIFER: Once upon a time,
there were two brothers Kane and Abel
They fought, as brothers often do, over everything
What's that supposed to be? Are we shaking hands
or holding spiders?
[CHUCKLES] That's you and your brother
pummeling each other over a pet rock
And here's you two scamps tugging on both ends of a snake
That's not how it happened
Well, artistic license, my friend
The point is that you were always at each other's throats
Until [SNIFFS]
you fought to the death
You killed Abel
and became the world's
first murderer
Now, the part where my father marks you,
cursing you to walk the earth for eternity,
- it's tricky to draw - Now, um,
I've heard this one before The ending sucks
My point exactly
We all know how your story ends
But what if we change how it begins?
What if you never killed Abel?
What if we did
this?
Clean slate
That's impossible How would we do that?
Oh, simple
I shall fly down to Hell,
pluck your brother's soul, and drop it into a vacant body
This would make Abel technically alive,
and therefore not murdered, and you innocent
Wait, back up My brother is in Hell?
Yes, of course In fact, he's our oldest tenant
I knew it Do you know how many times I've tried to tell people
Abel is the asshat? No one ever believes me
Right, can we just focus on my genius plan?
If we bring Abel back to life,
that would erase your crime
No crime, no mark, no curse
You'd be mortal and can finally die
PIERCE: This one's good 
Oh, this one's even better
Yeah, a bit past its sell-by date, I'm afraid
Wait till Abel wakes up in this body
I never thought I'd say this,
but slow down, Lieutenant
Time to lay down some soul-dropping rules,
or what I think the rules are, at least
You have done this before, right?
Not exactly, but based on a sample size of, uh,
one crooked cop and one goddess,
I can only drop a soul into someone who's recently died
How recent?
The instant after death
So we need a fresh one
How are we gonna find that?
Hey, guys?
There's been an explosion at a high-rise downtown
There's one dead at the scene, one on the way to the ICU
Oh, that's promising
- Excuse me? - He means that's a promising chance
to question the witness at the hospital
Mm Yes,
where loads of people are on the brink of death
So you want to question someone who's unconscious
and in critical condition?
The witness may recover, have some intel
- Can't hurt to check - Hmm
Okay, we'll work the crime scene
Lucifer, you coming?
Lucifer's coming with me this time
Shall we?
- Previously on Lucifer - I'm going to remove
Pierce's immortal curse
so he can finally die
I shall fly down to Hell,
pluck your brother's soul and drop it into a vacant body
This would make you innocent
- Amenadiel's nice - If he were nice,
he wouldn't be sneaking around behind my back with my friend
When will you understand that we were trying to protect you?!
I don't believe you
I know this is scary, but we need to start
- in your Hell - There are
so many things that Father can still take away from you
There is a bomb
If they move, the whole thing blows
I just wanted to say thank you again
- Couldn't have done it without you - Without me,
you wouldn't have been in danger in the first place
If the detective had died, it would have been my fault
I know I promised
to help you end your curse,
but we need to dissolve our unholy alliance
The risk is too great
I'll put it on
Ladies and gentlemen, Axara!
- Previosly on Lucifer - Mama's gone?
Yes I mean, she says
good-bye forever She loves you very much
I'm missing time
It's like someone else
was living my life
The one man I've cared about
I still gave him up
That's how much I care about our friendship
Go to
Hell
In the surveillance van,
when I asked you to stay in LA,
we did have a moment there
Which is why I had to tell you that I'm not
relationship material
You're terrified of letting someone get close to you
'cause you know they'll eventually leave you
- You'll outlive them - You got to have faith,
because life can surprise you
Now, if my brother, the Devil, can have that
Maybe I can, too
So, what brings you here?
Work
What you working on?
A case
Well, you want to take a break and buy me a drink?
Not really, no
Got to admit
Watching these women trying to get your attention
Best part of my night
I don't know what I'm gonna do
when you finally say yes to one of them
Never gonna say yes
Oh, yeah? 'Cause somebody already stole your heart?
It's just not in the cards for me
We got to go, Detective
Um duty calls
All right
Two more bodies were just found in Griffith Park holding hands
Looks like the Broken Hearts Killer strikes again
Stop calling him that
Why? What's the problem?
Because you never know
when something stupid like that's gonna stick
Come on That'll never stick
Wow Last night was so
- That was quite the concert - Yes!
I can't remember the last time
I went to a show that was so, uh
- Loud - So loud! I still can't hear anything
They totally boned
Miss Lopez, please don't be vulgar
The detective doesn't bone
Seriously, do you not see the epic fireworks?
There's more chemistry over there than in my lab
And they just went to the Axara concert
It's a natural aphrodisiac
Well, if you're a pimply millennial, perhaps,
but the detective is a grown woman
with sophisticated tastes
Trust me, she's not so easily won over
Oh, my God
You are totally freaking out right now
What?
About this coming between you and Chloe
Don't be preposterous
I'm not freaking out about anything
It's okay Okay, I-I get it
You're afraid that
they're gonna start spending all their time together
You know, joining each other at crime scenes,
bantering over dead bodies
And where does that leave you, right?
I assure you, Miss Lopez, that is the least of my worries
The chemistry in there is just a
a flash in the pan
- Exactly - Mm
A completely hot flash in the pan
Lucifer, what you and Chloe have is on a total other level
Exactly Nothing is changing
Nope Nope
Anyhow, I just
I wanted to say thank you for coming
I just I had a really great time
So when can we do it again?
Um uh
a con a concert, or?
I was thinking something quieter
Maybe dinner?
I know a pretty good Italian place if you're into that
Uh, I mean, I love Italian,
but, uh,
weren't you saying that you didn't want to?
Hey, Chloe, I just wanted to, uh
I'm sorry
I didn't mean to interrupt
- My bad - No, no You're good
We were just, um
Just
What's up?
Well, uh, we have a case Double murder
Some couple found in a convertible
at a lookout off Griffith Park
Super creepy scene, by the sounds of it
Mm-hmm Okay, I'll be right there
Espinoza, could I get a copy of that file?
Sure thing
What would I like?
Well
sometimes the answer to that is not so simple, is it?
I mean, I would like to know what my father's next test is
I feel pretty confident that I passed the last one,
but what's next?
And what am I supposed to do in between?
Or is that, in itself, a test?
Okay
How about a large mocha with extra whip?
Sure Sure
- Okay - Okay
Large Americano for Charlotte
Mom? Mom?!
I can't believe it's you
Uh, Lucifer said that you were gone,
that-that he used the Flaming Sword
and sent you into another universe
What are you doing back here?
I'm sorry Do I know you?
Uh
no
No, you don't
I, um I'm sorry
I thought you were someone else
No, wait You know Lucifer,
so you do know me
What did you mean, a "Flaming Sword"?
I'm really sorry, but I have to go
For the record, Detective, I'd like you to note
that I haven't once asked you about your evening with Pierce
I realize it's none of my business
You're right It's not
But Miss Lopez thinks you boned
What?
Her words, not mine
I, uh, simply thought you should know
We just went to a concert, you know?
It's not a big deal
Right That's what Dr Linda said, too
Well, for having this not be your business,
you're certainly talking to a lot of people about it
I know I just wish people would stop prying
But regardless, I've come to the conclusion
that no matter what happens with you and Pierce,
you and I are partners, Detective,
and nothing can come between that
Prepare yourselves, people
This is a different kind of case
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
Lieutenant, what brings you here?
I had a gut feeling about this case
I wanted to see if I was right
As much as we appreciate your digestive feelings, Lieutenant,
the detective and I have this utterly under control,
- so, if you don't mind - I don't mind at all
Ella, what do we have?
Meet Robbie Matthews and Rachel White
Looks like they were drugged unconscious,
and then someone literally smashed their chests in
Do we know how they were drugged?
Uh, best guess, maybe the killer used some form of anesthetic
Liquid or aerosol
And then crushed their ribs, their sternum
And finally, their hearts
Well, it's not hard to figure out what the desire was here
Well, the killer was clearly trying to send a message
That he couldn't stand this couple's relationship
So, what?
We think maybe she had a jealous stalker?
Or an angry ex We need to talk to anyone
who had a problem with this relationship
See, we've got this, Lieutenant
No need to mess with success
Which one of them was married?
Well, no weddings rings, so, neither of them, obviously
But good on you for participating
Has anyone checked their chest cavities yet?
What? Why would we do that?
In the 50s, there was a guy named Clark Hoffman
He was known for making his victims
swallow their wedding rings
Right, the Broken Hearts Killer
By the time they caught him,
he'd killed seven cheating couples in LA
His crime scenes were about as gruesome as this
Wow, you really know a lot about this
The cop who solved the case
was an old mentor of mine
And didn't Hoffman die a few days ago in prison?
Making him a particularly useless addition
to this conversation
Unless his death inspired a copycat
Or maybe they're using this as an MO to throw us off
Thank you
- I hope that's all it is - All righty,
guess we'll get out the old chest spreader
and go fishing for some wedding rings
Or, according to their social media profile,
Rachel was single, and Robbie was married
We need to talk to the spouse ASAP
Yep Don't worry
Nothing's changing
- Nothing at all - Hmm
Okay, Monkey, you grab the backpack,
I'll grab the brownies,
and we'll get you to school
Maze, are you home?
Hey
Daddy
- there's a man in my bed - What?
And he smells bad
I see you found the band
Go wait in the car
Seriously, what were you thinking
letting a drunken rocker sleep in Trixie's bed?
I was thinking he was too drunk
to make it up the stairs to Chloe's bed
What's the big deal?
The big deal, Maze,
is that you live with a nine-year-old
It's not okay
Ooh did I make Dan mad?
Why are you
Are you going through something lately?
Other than the band, no
Fine
Whatever Clean up
I don't want to have to tell Chloe about this
She has enough on her plate right now
You know, there are some things
I could tell Chloe, too
Like what?
Like
remember when we had a guy killed?
Yeah
That was fun
Seems we both have things we'd rather Chloe not know
Look, I don't know what's going on with you right now,
but whatever it is figure it out
Emma Mathews just got brought in
And Emma Matthews is
The victim's wife
Right Yes, of course
Well, mustn't keep the murderous lady waiting
Mind if I join?
You sure? You don't have to
I know I want to
Great The more the merrier
Uh I know what you're doing
I'm getting ready to question a suspect
And I hate to break it to you, Cain,
but there's only room for one immortal
in the detective's life,
- and that position's already been filled - By you
The detective and I are a team A package deal, if you will
Sadly, there's just no room for a third
And I don't understand why
you're trying to spend time with her anyway
What happened to the whole wanting to die thing?
I had a change of heart
I'm sorry if I upset you
I didn't think you two were a thing
We're not a thing
We're partners
Well, if that's all it is, then you've got nothing
to worry about, do you?
Wait
Right
Yeah
Fine, fine
I prefer standing anyway
Emma,
four months ago, your husband reported that
you slashed his tires Then two months ago,
neighbors saw you throwing rocks through his window
And then just last month,
you were seen threatening him with a bat
Can you explain that?
Look, I'm not proud of what happened
But I was upset
I just found out Robbie was cheating on me
Well, completely understandable
I mean, what else are you supposed to do
when some parasite inserts himself into your relationship?
So is that why you did this?
What?
Is this for real?
I admit I hated Rachel,
but I would never hurt Robbie
I-I may have gone a little nuts
when I learned he was cheating, but
after the courts forced me into therapy,
we started talking
We chose to divorce amicably
Oh, God
I can't believe he's dead
This is preposterous
Do you really expect us to believe
that you were okay with someone tearing you two apart?
- It's the truth - Does the name
Clark Hoffman mean anything to you?
Who?
I know we're gonna check out her alibi,
but my gut tells me to believe her
Oh, please Just 'cause she spouted some drivel
about conscious uncoupling?
Because she has no idea who the Broken Hearts Killer is
and she has no motive to go after Robbie
Well, she's obviously lying,
about her relationships and the murders
Please tell me I'm not the only one who sees that
- Detective? - I think we can't take
- Emma's word at face value - Mm-hmm
We don't have to Another couple
was just found dead holding hands
This time at a cheap motel
The Safari Inn
This isn't just a lovers' quarrel
No, you're right
The copycat's just getting started
Lieutenant, we need you on this case
And I normally love threesomes
Meet Mary Lee and Dennis Horn
Just like our first lovers, they were drugged unconscious
before the killer took something really big and really hard
and literally
- Bludgeoned their hearts - Mm-hmm
And then moved them here and staged this whole scene
And just like the other victims, one of them's married
She's got a tan line on her ring finger
We actually ended up finding
a wedding ring inside the first victim,
so good bet we'll probably find one here, too
Any other evidence?
More like lack thereof
Place was wiped clean,
just like the first crime scene
I mean, this killer, you guys,
whoever he Or she is,
total pro
Well, Emma's alibi checks out
There's no obvious connection between the couples
I just wonder how the killer's picking his targets
Well, Lieutenant,
as our resident Broken Hearts expert,
wouldn't you say it's time to enlighten us with your wisdom?
No one knew how the original killer chose his victims
I guess we just got lucky we caught him when we did
"We"?
The LAPD
We don't have time for luck We got to get back
to the station, figure out a connection
between these victims
Yes, I couldn't agree more, Detective
After all, the sooner we finish this case,
the sooner things can all go back to normal
Oof
Gnarly
You're burning my table
Hmm?
Oh, I'm sorry
Um
You don't ever take a moment to stop, do you?
No rest for the wicked,
so no rest for me, either
I've got you figured out, you know
You do, huh?
You could work anywhere
Your office, your home,
but you choose to work in this bar
Why?
I like a stiff drink?
Because you don't actually want to be alone
Then why do I sit by myself?
Maybe you feel like you don't deserve the company
Well, look who's a detective now
So, what are you spending all these
lonesome hours on, anyway?
I'm working on trying to find the guy
who kills cheating couples
The Broken Hearts Killer?
That's what they call him
Six crime scenes, not one shred of evidence
It's like I'm looking for clues that don't exist
It never ceases to amaze me,
the lengths people will go to
when they want to make something just right
What do you mean?
Like when people come into the bar
for a special occasion,
like a birthday or a proposal
Sometimes they'll come in here days ahead of time
just to make sure everything's perfect
Maybe it's the same for
whoever this Broken Hearts guy is
All right, Lieutenant, what did you want to show us?
- I may have a lead - Ah, did you find it during AV Club?
We already know the killer disabled
the hotel's surveillance cameras
On the day of the murders, yes,
but then I started thinking what if the killer
scoped out the location a week before?
And I found this
- Wait, is that - Our guy? Maybe
The car's registered to a Neil Berger, former schoolteacher
Well, that's it, a chap snapping photos?
How do we know he's not scrapbooking?
I put an APB out on him, and
We just got a hit
He's been spotted in front of the original killer's house
Let's go
We-Well, that's
actually quite promising
Hi
Listen, I know we're not exactly speaking right now,
but there's something that I need to tell you
Okay
Now, don't freak out, but, uh,
Charlotte Richards is back
Oh
But you have absolutely nothing to worry about, Linda
She's not, uh
You know, she's not Mom anymore
Wow
It's really kind of you
to come all the way over here to tell me that
I mean, especially when you must be dealing with
such a shock yourself
You knew, didn't you?
I may have run into Charlotte
a few times I don't know,
maybe here
You're treating her, Linda?
You didn't think,
just once,
that maybe I had the right to know that she was alive?
I assumed you knew
Well, maybe you can help me
For the last time, man,
please, please quit taking pictures of my house!
Your house?
You're lucky you get to live here, okay?
This place should be a freakin' landmark by now!
Do you know who lived here? A great artist, man
- Who are you?! - Seriously, last warning, dude
Next time, I'm calling the cops
Call the cops They'll be on my side
Oh, whatever
- Neil Berger? - Yeah
Wow Sorry you had to witness that
Um, bah
Okay, who's ready?
Ready for what?
For the wonder that is the Broken Hearts Tour
Duh You guys are my 3:00, right?
Uh-huh
All right, all right Let's get some ponchos on you
When I ran into Charlotte, I-I-I may have mentioned
a few things that I shouldn't have
But by the time I realized that she wasn't Mom
it was too late
Oh, no
You know, she was just staring at me
with these these lost eyes,
searching for answers
What are you asking me, Amenadiel?
I think that maybe she deserves to know the truth
I understand that
you miss your mom
and that you didn't get to say good-bye
But Charlotte is a woman who has literally
been to Hell and back
She's fragile
When I found out the truth, it nearly broke me
And I was stable
So what are you saying?
I'm saying if you really want to help Charlotte
you'll stay away
Originally built in 1909,
Hoffman's iconic Craftsman home
is just blocks away from what I like to call
"The Last Heartbreak"
The scene of the final murder,
and where the killer was ultimately
apprehended by police
Why are we wasting our time
with these ridiculous shenanigans?
Let's just grab this miscreant and be done with it
Because, unfortunately, we don't have
enough evidence to arrest him
Serial killers love talking about themselves
The more Neil talks, the more likely
he'll incriminate himself
I may as well be speaking to myself
Uh, I'm listening
Um, excuse me, uh, Neil, is it?
Yeah Well, I was wondering what you thought about
this new copycat killer who surfaced
Ask me, it was only a matter of time before someone picked up
where the original killer left off You know, someone special
Someone who knew there was a need for what he did
Right The original killer, he was an auteur
But this new guy, he's just
Sort of a cheap copy
Whoa
Hold on a second
This new guy is not the original,
okay, but he is a damn sweet cover
He is efficient, he is precise
I mean, he gets the little details right,
down to the interlocking fingers
Detective Decker, LAPD
That information wasn't public yet, was it?
No, it wasn't
Finally, this bloody charade is over,
and things can all go back to normal
I'll meet you back at the precinct
Ow
You're burning my table
Can I help you?
Kay?
Kay Kay, how is this possible?
Is this a prank?
Did someone put you up to this?
Look, I get it
I look just like my grandmother,
but this is taking things too far
Your grandmother, of course
I'm sorry, I knew her back in the day
The resemblance is incredible
You knew her back in the day?
How old were you, like, two?
I'm older than I look
Well, Mr Older Than You Look, I'm Maddie
Hi Pierce
I used to come in here a lot,
back when I was just a detective
That's what we do here
Cheap drinks, good cooking and cops
That's actually how my grandparents met
Gramps was a cop,
and he met Nana when she was waiting tables
- "Raids" White is your grandfather? - Yep
Cops are always coming in here
and geeking out over him
Well, yeah Kay married the cop
who solved the Broken Hearts Killer case
Well, he made the arrest, but he never really solved it
He caught the guy red-handed,
staging bodies in the Chavez Ravine
True, but he never revealed how he chose his victims
It drove Gramps crazy, so he kept at it
even after he retired
He would sit in that booth right there
with his old files when Nana worked
Where is Ray these days?
Forest Lawn Cemetery
Uh, Gramps passed about six years ago
And her?
Followed a little after
- I'm sorry - Don't be
They lived a long, happy life together,
and went peacefully, a few months apart
That sounds nice
All right, case closed, I assume
And not a particularly interesting one, in retrospect
Let's find something that's more challenging, you know?
More "us"
This case isn't over We have to get a confession out of Neil
Oh, so you and Pierce can do your dynamic duo thing again?
No It's you and me this time, no Pierce
Oh No Pierce, but we're still following his lead in absentia
We are following the case
Let's go solve this
So Neil, from your tour,
I saw that you like to tell a good story,
so tell me one now: how'd you do it?
Yeah
Uh, well, it was early
And, uh, we met at a bar
And then, I, uh, I gave him a sign
And he came over, at which point, I think I said, "Hey,"
and then, he was all like
- "Hey," and then - Right Can you fast-forward
to the part where you smashed the couples' chests in?
Wait a minute
You-you think I'm the copycat?
You fit the killer's psychological profile to a T,
you know things about the case that no one else could know
Oh, my God
This is gonna be so amazing for the tour
Now I'm actually part of the investigation
Oh, geez, I owe McMillan now
Mc McMillan?
Yeah Yeah, yeah Officer McMillan over in Vice
He's helped me out throughout the years
You know, he would slip me, uh,
copies of stuff for the tour
And then, when these new killings started happening,
well, I bought some photos off of him,
and it was the best 400 bucks I've ever spent
Ha! So Pierce doesn't know everything, after all
Thank you
Hey, Dan
If you're looking for Twisted Ferret,
they've got a gig in Bakersfield
They'll be back
Because this gig is still the best gig in town
The school called
Apparently, Trixie gave pot brownies
to Ms Benson for Teacher Appreciation Day
Well, did she appreciate them?
No, she didn't, Maze
She didn't appreciate being rushed to the hospital
when she couldn't feel her legs anymore
The woman's 70 years old What the hell were you thinking?
Hey, not my fault the old hag can't handle the good stuff
It's not a joke, Maze!
Our one red line is our daughter,
and things like this cannot happen
Or what, Douche?
If you want to live in the same home as my kid,
you can't keep pulling stunts like this
Fine
I'll move out
Since none of you want me here anyway
That's not what I'm saying
No
No, you would all love me to be something I'm not
Well, I am not a babysitter
I am not a roommate
And I am sick of your Goody Two-shoes ex-wife,
and that stupid little brat of yours anyway
Maze
Classy
So Neil isn't our killer
No, he's just an obsessed tour guide
who legally obtained crime scene photos
- So we don't have any suspects - Yeah, and our killer
could be trying to find his next victim
We need a lead
Hold on
You said your grandfather kept copies of all his files
Do you still have them?
Somewhere in the back, yeah
My mom didn't have the heart to throw them out
You mind if I take a look?
Sure
Chloe, meet me at The Adams
I may have something
Yeah I'm on my way
Ah I know that look
Either there are new sandwiches in the vending machine,
or you have a lead
Actually, Pierce has a lead
Oh, for goodness' sake
He wants us to meet him Why?
So we can watch him pontificate
while leading us down another blind alley?
What is your problem today?
My problem, Detective, is that we don't need a third party
interfering with our partnership
You know what? Maybe it's best
if I meet Pierce alone
We don't have time to make this about you
There is a serial killer on the loose
Uh Detective
To wrapping up your latest case
Sayonara, Broken Hearts Killer
Well, Ray was actually the one to catch him,
but I'm happy to drink to that anyway
Now, maybe you can take me on a real date,
instead of just pie and drinks here
Let me guess, you already have your next case
No, not this time
Um
I'm transferring
Out of state
Transferring?
Why?
It's just time
I don't understand
This is what I do I move forward and I never look back
But I thought we you and I were
I deal with death every day,
and someday, you're gonna die, too, and I just
You have these walls up,
and I thought it was part of your whole tough guy act,
but now I see what it is: you're scared
But you know what the sad truth is?
If you don't learn to open up,
nobody will ever love you
I know
Pierce, look at this
Hey
Pierce
Are you okay?
Yeah, sorry Um
What were you saying?
Your mentor,
look at all this stuff that he found, like,
look these call logs
They prove that the original killer's victims
all had spouses that called into the Dear Dottie radio show
That was a radio show about love and relationship advice
Yeah
Yeah You really know your history
A-Anyway,
it's the only connection that was found between the victims
But that show went off the air years ago
I'm not sure how it's gonna help us now
Well, if the original killer listened to the radio show
to find his victims, then maybe
the copycat's doing the same thing
So the question is what radio show would that be now?
Oh, my God Chance's Chocolates?
I'm obsessed
It's a radio show that sets up cheating couples
See, Chance brings someone on who thinks
their spouse is cheating, and then,
he calls the cheater pretending to be a candy shop
giving away free chocolates as a promotion,
and asks who they should send it to
- How thrilling - Right?
And then, the person either names their partner
and "Aw, happy ending," or they name someone else,
and expose their dirty,
cheating ways
Oh, it's so juicy
So it turns out, both couples
had a significant other that appeared on the show
So we're assuming
that our killer listens to this juvenile program?
We've narrowed our suspects down to anyone
who doesn't have satellite radio, and Ms Lopez
Actually, the addresses are beeped out
Probably for reasons like this
Okay, so the killer has to be somebody that works on the show
Someone with access to this info?
Right So we need to make ourselves the target,
and flush the killer out
Great idea Decker and I will do it
We'll give out my home address
and lure the killer there
Sure
- That could work - Oh, man
You guys are totally gonna be the cheating lovers
Marvelous Well, since that's been sorted,
I assume my services are no longer needed
Uh, actually,
there is one more piece
of the sting we'll need
And we are here with our jilted lover, Lucifer
Now, first off,
what is up with that name? "Lucifer"? I-I
You think maybe
that is part of the reason that's driving a wedge
between you and your old lady?
Well, first off, I am not a "jilted lover"
No, no No one ever wants to believe that, do they?
But you wouldn't be here if you probably didn't think
something was going on, right?
And we're gonna find out exactly what that is
when we come back
You're doing great, by the way
You're late!
Yeah, sorry I'm late Traffic was just awful
Stop
I ordered a pastrami
Is this pastrami? No, it is not pastrami!
Now get out of here!
And we are back with our guest Lucifer,
who is now gonna tell us all about his girl Chloe
Uh, right Well, um, she's my partner
At work
Oh, so it's a workplace thing, huh?
When did things change?
Well, she's been spending quite a bit of time with our new boss
Cheating on you with the boss?
Oh, that's low
Well, it's quite a bit more complex
than your obnoxious braying's making it out to be
Well, let's find out, shall we?
Let's get Chloe on the line
Uh, yes?
Uh, hello, uh, Chloe?
Uh, this is, uh, Pop Sugar
We are a new Swiss chocolate shop in Los Feliz,
and we are, uh, running a big promotion
Yeah, we are going to send, uh, a free box of chocolates
to, uh, your special someone,
if you have a special someone somewhere?
Oh, wow
Wow, yeah, that's awesome Um
and-and actually, it's perfect timing
Um, as we're having, um, a date night tonight
Oh! Wonderful
All we need, then, is his name and address
Yeah, his name is Marcus, and he lives at
Okay, Chloe, that is good
Listen, I'm just curious,
because we're all such romantics here,
what is it about, uh, t-this, uh, guy
that gives you the goose bumps?
Uh
um
well, he's, um
he's
he's very handsome
Yeah, but isn't there anything, uh, more than just looks?
Um, well, he's very brave,
and we both care about the same sorts of things,
like, well, doing what's right,
and, uh, and helping other people
I think he's a good person
Sounds like a hell of a guy
Uh, and we'll make sure to get that package to him
uh, before the end of the night
Okay, thanks
And there you have it, everyone
Another cheater exposed
Sometimes, chocolate can be dark,
but you know what?
Isn't better to always know the truth?
Where the hell did he go?
Welcome to my humble abode
Um
I like rocks
You have a rock collection?
Well, the thing about rocks is they're old
They never change
I've taken one from all the places I've visited
You've been a lot of places, huh?
Well, gather no moss and all that
I know I don't have a lot of things,
but what I love about this place is the killer view
Oh, my God
This is beautiful
Decker, listen
I know that our, uh, opportunity for a second date
was interrupted earlier
Hopefully this will make up for it
Hey, you guys all set?
Hey, Dan Yeah We're all set here
Coast is clear on my end
Ah, excellent Daniel You're here
Hey, pal I didn't know you were coming in for this one
I wasn't, but, um, I wanted to ask you something
Okay
How did you move on from the detective
when I showed up and replaced you?
And please, don't say improv
- You didn't replace me - Well, true, true
I suppose that would imply we're on the same level
Look, I get it All right?
I get how you feel with this whole Pierce and Chloe thing
- Mm - And, yes,
I admit, I did feel a little jealous when you showed up
Well, justifiably so
But then I realized you had nothing to do
with why my marriage ended
You and I are different people
We each have our own relationship with Chloe
Once I came to terms with that, I was fine
I hope you don't mind
I asked Lopez what your favorite dish was
No, it's, um, it's great
Is something wrong?
Um
um, Marcus, maybe we shouldn't do this
Are we too visible?
No
- Is the plan too obvious? - No, no, no
I mean you and me
You know, we work together and things could get weird
That's all
Look, you asked me out first, Decker
I, uh I did
and you turned me down
And I I was disappointed, but, you know, I got it
And you're the one who said you're, you know,
"not relationship material"
You're a good man and I really like you,
but I, uh, I-I need somebody who can let me in
and I just don't know if that's you
Hello, shadowy figure
Here to spoil the date?
God! God!
LAPD You're under arrest
I know my rights, okay?
Fair use, I want a lawyer
Pastrami boy?
- You're the killer? - Killer? What?
What are you talking about? Dude, I'm here for the show
- What show? - The show, the show
I-I-I try to film an angry ex busting in on their spouse
Like you and then I put it up on my Web site
as a bootleg after show Hey!
Hey, look, I'm trying to be a producer, man
The only reason I'm interning
is so I can get access to those tapes
and I post those tapes raw and unedited on my Web site
Unedited?
Without the addresses censored out?
Well, yeah, I mean, that's what unedited means
I'm showing life at its most raw
Ow
The killer could be listening to those tapes
Could be anyone
Maybe I should've waited until after dinner
to say all that
No, you're right
I do have walls up
I've had them up for a long, long time
When I feel like someone's
getting past them, I run
But with you, Chloe, I don't want those walls up anymore
I don't want to run anymore
You deserve someone who's gonna let you in
and I want to do that if you'll give me the chance
That's
Chloe?
You all right?
Chloe!
Chloe
You shouldn't have hurt him
Too bad
If you'd started with him, I would've let you swing
You you're the you're the guy from the radio
Yes, and you're the chap
who bought the original killer's house
How remarkably method of you
Don't-don't-don't you get it?
I-I-I-I did this for you
I-I these-these two, they-they-they betrayed you
I didn't ask for this
But you deserve it
I found Hoffman's journals
hidden in the attic
He understood how hard it is to lose someone you care about
We wanted to show the world
that you-you can't just leave people
You don't get to decide who someone wants to be with
And neither do I
Does this mean you're-you're not, you're not gonna
Detective
Oh, my God Are they okay?
They're fine They're fine
Come on Wakey-wakey, Detective
Come on, pal
Lieutenant Pierce
I've got a wake-up for Charlotte
You are following me
No, this-this is, this is just where I come to read the paper
I know when people are lying to me
Honestly, this is just, um, all it's really
all a big misunderstanding
So all the crazy stuff you said earlier
is a misunderstanding?
Please, I just
You don't understand what it's like
not remembering what you did,
not knowing who you were
All I want is the truth
How do we know each other?
You were my mom
I know
I know
Please, have a seat
There is, uh, there is so much to explain
Olga? Wait, I'm sorry
I thought that Maze was gonna be here watching Trixie
No Maze
She said mean thing to me and then she go
What do you mean, "she go"?
She take her knives and she move out
Oh
Thank you, Olga
I know Thank you, though
Olga, did you forget something?
Well, that's a new one
Never been mistaken for an Olga before
What are you doing here?
I, um
I wanted to explain
- Look, I know that I've been acting - Insecure
Childish Possessive
Well, I was going to say strangely, but
never mind
The truth is that perhaps I was slightly insecure
about Pierce moving in on our partnership
Oh, Lucifer, that's not what's happening
No, I know,
because I've realized that there's room in your life
for all sorts of relationships,
even if one of them is with with him
- I know - Just
please, be careful
Okay
Do you want to stay? I can make some coffee
- and we can - Ah, I can't, unfortunately
There's a bachelorette party at Lux and well
Okay, another time
Yes
Okay, well have fun
Dinner sounds great
How about tomorrow?
- That's perfect - Good I'll pick you up at 7:00?
- Yeah - I'll see you then, Chloe
Someone special, I assume?
Yes, she is
And for the first time of my life I'm gonna go for it
Good for you
You have to risk the broken heart if you wonna get something
out of this life, right?
That's not my heart of risking
She's the key to finally getting what I've always wanted

- Previously on Lucifer - There's only room for one
immortal in the detective's life, and that position's
- already been filled - By you?
The detective and I are a team There's just no room for a third
- You're a good man - You deserve someone
who's gonna let you in,
and I want to do that if you'll give me the chance
Mom! Lucifer said that you were gone
Do I know you? You know Lucifer
You do know me
And I am sick
of your Goody Two-shoes ex-wife
and that stupid little brat of yours
Charlotte Richards is back
I think that maybe she deserves to know the truth
She's not so easily won over
You are totally freaking out right now
- What? - About this coming between you and Chloe
Don't be preposterous
Bloody hell!
Easy, Maze! Gah
Could have taken my eye out with that spatula
What on earth are you looking for?
And why are we meeting here, anyway?
- I heard you moved out - I did
I forgot my knife
Must have left it here somewhere
Oh, no,
not one of your hell-forged blades that is a loss
Not a blade A knife
Forged in I don't know, China
Ah Right, priceless
I can't find it anywhere
Green tea coconut water
Worth the trip, at least
You can't find this stuff in Hell
What do you mean, Hell?
I am so done, Lucifer
I am done with this apartment,
all humans
Earth, in general
I want out Now
I want to go home
You
you want me to fly you down to Hell?
For good? That's a bit rash, isn't it?
No, it's not And I've made up my mind, so
get your wings out
- No biggie - Wrong
Big biggie Huge biggie
I don't know if you remember, Maze, but last time
I took someone on a celestial Uber ride,
the detective almost died
Seriously?
You're saying no because you're afraid of your daddy?
No, I just don't want anyone to get hurt
Look, you-you clearly need to blow off some steam, don't you?
Take your mind off Ameninda?
No Lindadiel?
Whatever That whole fiasco
How about a nice weekend in Catalina?
You went to Hell for Pierce,
a guy you don't even like,
and you won't do the same for me?
No
I swear to you, Lucifer,
you are gonna regret this
Are you threatening me, Mazikeen?
Oh, hey Hey, guys
What happened?
Don't worry, Detective
Maze was just leaving Weren't you?
Oh
Wait, wait, hold on Maze, Maze, um
you know, I've been trying to explain to Trixie
that there must be some reason why you hurt her feelings
You know, some misunderstanding
Or at least, I hope
No
I just forgot some of my stuff That's it
Maze
Look, I never asked you to move out
Can't you see that you're doing this to yourself?
So now this is my fault?
Maze, come on
Demons Am I right?
Lucifer, name-calling isn't gonna help
Um, maybe you should go talk to her
You know? Like now
Well, I'd rather not, Detective
It seems like she needs space Miles of it
Well, now's not the best time
for you to
Hey
Lucifer
Hello, Lieutenant
What, uh what are you doing here?
Uh
I mean, I suppose I knew you two were becoming friendly
I just didn't expect to see you here
On a weekend
Wearing open-toe, non-work-related Birkis
We were at the beach
Yeah
To a beach murder
There was a murder at the beach
New case I-I was gonna tell you
But I didn't because I know how much you
hate
sand
Right
Body's in the ice chest, is it? I'm sure Ms Lopez will have
something to say about that
Hmm
Well, then, um
best of luck with your beach murder
Do you want to stay, or?
Beach murder?
I'm sorry I-I-I panicked
'Cause he's a coworker, and, you know, you're a coworker
Maybe we should talk about some work
life boundaries Besides, I didn't know
if you wanted everybody to know that we were dating
I don't care who knows
You don't?
No If you want to take it slow, that's okay,
but from where I stand, I'm all in
So, I was getting coffee, minding my own business,
and a guy grabs my arm
Really? What kind of guy?
A tall, serious black man
Bald
Bald, like, in a in a very sexy way?
Yes You know him?
Uh, no No
Just, um, painting a picture
I can I can see it all now
Well, he called me Mom
Said some really strange things
Sounds like a real nut bar
It's a good thing you're not gonna see him again
That's the thing
He came back
- He did? - Then he claimed
that he could fill in what happened in my memory gap
What he said then was truly bizarre
Yeah, well, he should have left well enough alone
Whoever he is
Maybe you should just forget about it,
keep moving forward, like you've been doing
You have to hear how crazy it was
He said Lucifer was his brother
Which I guess is possible if one of them were adopted
And raised with a different accent
- Yeah, it's - Then he said
I was his stepmom But he's a grown man
I mean, his father would have to be ancient
Oh, right I
I mean, as if I would go running around marrying old men
and then forgetting all about it
Would I?
Charlotte, I don't think this man,
whoever he is
has your best interests at heart
That's the thing
He seemed to really care about me
At least who I was then
This man wasn't lying
At least he believed
he was telling the truth
Which means
I should dig a little deeper into his story Right?
Right
She's being really self-destructive
I mean, she's losing all of her friends
Maze is definitely spiraling out of control
I'm worried about her
She gets like this sometimes
Maze just needs to blow off some steam, that's all
I told her so myself, and I'm quite sure she'll see sense
Thanks
Hey, Ella What do we have?
Mid-30s, male, multiple stab wounds
No ID, so I'm gonna run his prints through IBIS
Right Detective, do you think
- this might be related to your beach murder? - Ugh
I hate beach murders
So mean It's, like, just let people swim
Mm
Um, there was no beach murder
Ah So what was Pierce doing at your house, then?
We had a date
Right
Right I thought as much
Bully for you, Detective
Uh, did I mention the Vic was male? And, uh,
would you look at those earlobes?
So big Huge Huge earlobes
Which tells me absolutely nothing But I can keep going
And the gunsho Ooh, look! Oh, wait, looky there
Oh Security camera Okay
I'll see if there's, uh, footage of the crime
Oh, let it out, buddy Even though Pierce and Decker
are totally hot together, I know change is rough
Ms Lopez, please Enough
- Thank you - Lucifer
okay, you and Chloe
have this undefined something or other, okay,
that I never really understood
It's-it's on a a whole other plane
Even though Pierce and Decker, I mean,
whoo-ee, what gorgeous babies those two would have, or die trying
But I'm sorry this is rough for you
No, I'm fine I'm fine
I'm more than fine, actually
I mean, those two dating
was practically my idea, so
Can we?
Uh, yeah, so
Guys
We got something
Yeah
Oh, no
That isn't
You told her to blow off some steam?
Well, I was really hoping she'd choose Catalina
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
There's no sign of Maze at any of the usual spots
And she's not answering my calls
Most definitely the actions of an innocent woman
Well, let's not jump to conclusions
It's not like the video shows her
actually stabbing our Vic
No Merely plucking
her knife out of his chest
Do you really think she did this?
I mean, yes, Maze is rash
Or nuclear, more like
There's got to be another explanation
There is It's about me
Maze asked me to take her home, and I said no,
at which point she flew into a rage
and threatened to make me sorry
So she's clearly acting out
But if she thinks she can manipulate me
into changing my mind, then she's sorely mistaken
So you didn't give her a ride home one night
I mean, call me crazy, but that doesn't make someone kill
Hey
Hey there, Lieutenant
Um any updates?
Mm-hmm Our Vic is an ex-con
named Mike Biltz
Hmm An active bounty of Mazikeen Smith
- Hmm - Well, Maze bounties
a lot of people, you know
She's a overachiever, that Maze
She's had a prior run-in with him
It says she brought him in once before
So she knows him It doesn't mean anything
Or one very obvious thing Guilty
Chloe, is this case too personal for you?
Maybe your roommate isn't who you think she is
- Ex-roommate I'm just saying - All right,
well, I'll need you to stay impartial
Copy that I'll keep it completely professional
Where as I, on the other hand,
will keep things entirely personal
I will not rest until we track down that manipulative demon
In fact, I'm gonna go and look for Maze again now
All right Great I'm gonna check out a lead
on our Vic's last place of employment some winery
called Monte De Oro I'll go with you
Okay
Uh, no need, Lieutenant
Actually, on second thought,
I think I should make 100% certain
of Maze's guilt before I find and punish her
Come on, partner
Okay
Hmm We'll take my car, shall we?
So romantic, the California coastline, isn't it?
- Yeah Yeah, it really is - Mm
Speaking of
That beach date that you went on with Pierce,
was it a date date?
Um, it was just a regular date
Ah
Well, you're free to spend your
your spare time with whomever you choose
I mean, I'm not one for gorilla-sized ham hands
or stale alcohol breath or, yeah, just the general blokes,
but I suppose there's no accounting for taste, is there?
No No, there's not
No also, I-I'm surprised
that you'd date someone so on in years
Huh? What are you talking about?
Oh, believe me, Pierce is, uh,
well, he's much older than he looks
And we all know that dating older men has its downsides:
performance, stamina, you know, the important bits
Okay, Lucifer
Well, I just hate to see you unsatisfied, that's all
Lucifer, I'm not discussing this with you
- Okay, okay - Okay?
Besides, Pierce and I, we're not even sleeping to
You know, we're not
We're not, and never mind, and it's none of your business
So, how far are we? Are we there?
Uh, we're nearly there
Okay
Thank you for talking with us, Mrs Channing
Please, call me Margo
Tragic news
We want to help any way we can
Great Um, well, what can you tell us about Mike?
Well, Zack would know better
He's the winery foreman and Mike's supervisor
- Okay - He was a good worker
Quiet Never gave us any trouble
Mm-hmm And did you all know he had a criminal record
and that he was currently out on bail?
No, I wasn't
It's always the quiet ones, isn't it?
The truth is,
if we looked too closely at all our workers,
there'd be no one left to tend the grapes
Way I saw it, Mike was a good guy
He deserved better
And did you notice anything strange in the last few weeks?
Uh, any fights
that he got in or money troubles? Anything like that?
Well, there was something the other day
Someone came looking for him
Ah, was it a a hot woman, perhaps?
Angry? Leather? Lots of knives?
Or someone completely different?
- Like a dude? Like a fat, happy dude? - No
What he said
A pretty woman in black leather came looking for Mike
Right Well, Morningstar, one, Decker, nil
- Not that I'm counting - Anyhow, carry on
Uh, Mike was out at the time,
so she hung around his trailer, then took off
When I told him, he kind of freaked out about it
Then I forgot all about it
Uh, could we get a look at that trailer?
Oh Oh, this is lovely, isn't it?
Aha!
Her favorite beverage
Well, surely this is evidence that Maze is guilty
And well hydrated
Well, let's just wait and see what the lab has to say
I'm sure lots of people drink green tea coconut water
Right
I told you not to talk to Charlotte,
and you literally did the exact opposite of what I said
Why bother asking for my advice at all?
I couldn't help it, Linda, all right?
I'm sorry
She's not your mother anymore
She's a human woman in pain
who isn't ready to hear what you have to say
Well, I disagree
She's in pain because she doesn't know the full story
Whether or not she's my mother, Linda, I owe her the truth
At least some of the truth
I didn't go into the celestial details
And she can tell you're holding back
And now she has more questions
I really thought we decided
we weren't gonna do this
You mean you decided
You decided, Linda
Just like how you decided that we were over
Point taken
But Amenadiel, please, ask yourself
are you doing this
because you think it's what's best for Charlotte,
or what's best for you?
Oh, my God
You guys are so adorable
I can't even stand it
Looks like you caught us, Lopez
Uh, hey Did you get anything back on the coconut water?
Uh, no, but they are rushing the order
Chloe
- Hey - Pierce
I, uh, looked into
other known associates of the victim
Surviving family members, etcetera
- So far, no leads - Okay
Oh
Here, have a seat
- Ah, lovely Thank you very much - Yeah
It's not like there's 20 other chairs
Ooh!
All warmed up for me
So, any news on our murderous friend?
Listen, guys, if Maze did this,
would any of you really be shocked?
- Yeah - I would
- No, not at all - There's no way
Let me settle it for you
I did it
What are you all waiting for?
I just said I did it
Maze, hold on
You have the right to remain silent
Anything you say
can and will be used against you
Don't have time for all of that
I'm the big, bad killer, so let's move it along
Agreed Let's book her
Lucifer, it's called due process
She doesn't have to do this
The evidence against her is circumstantial
Well, let me help you with that
Murder weapon should do it
Put it down Now
All yours
Come on, boys
You know you want to
- Stand up - Oh
Stand up
I know this looks bad
We have a video,
a murder weapon, and a full confession
I know It just
It doesn't feel like her
I thought you said you weren't gonna let your feelings
get in the way of this case
- And I'm not - Just like you're not letting
your feelings for Lucifer get between you and me?
W-What?
Is there something going on
between you and Lucifer?
No No
Lucifer and I, we-we're partners
We're friends
Do all your friends give you jewelry?
This?
Lucifer gave me this as a joke
It's a funny story, actually
He says it was the closest I ever came
to penetrating him
Which, see,
we've never actually had sex
- Oh - Never mind
It just It was funny at the time
Well, we're gonna book Maze
If you really believe she's innocent,
you're gonna have to bring in the real killer
I'll start by talking to her
More talking?
Less of a conversation,
really, more of a "j'accuse"
We just want to have a chat
As friends,
- because that's what we are - Are we?
Let's talk motive,
because I cannot think of a single reason
why you would want to kill that man
Who needs a reason?
I'm just evil
I mean, that's what you all think, right?
- No - Right
Look, I've told you already, Detective,
she is doing this to manipulate me
Well, newsflash, Mazikeen
I am not taking you home
Yeah, I heard you the first time, and I don't care
This way, I'll end up in women's prison
I heard it's hell on earth, so close enough
Right Well, maybe orange is the new Maze
Perhaps some time in the clink
might actually make you sorry for trying to control me
What are you talking about?
She could get life in prison
That's a mere time-out in her lifespan
All right, let's talk about the actual crime
Maze, tell me what happened
I stabbed a guy
See?
How many times?
Two or three
Or four?
You're not even close
The victim was stabbed ten times
Right, well,
I was mad,
so guess I forgot to count
Did you happen to follow the victim to a winery?
- Sure - Drink anything while you were there?
Wine
- Now do you believe me? - I believe you
- Yes I knew she didn't do it - Yes
You know what this means, Detective
We need to bust Maze out
Let's smuggle her something she can use to escape
What happened to "a mere time-out" in women's prison?
Well, we can't punish the innocent,
or even the usually guilty but innocent this one time
It's the principle of the matter
We have to find the real killer
It's the only way to keep Maze out of jail
I hear someone's
headed for jail? I'm ready to draw up
the arrest warrant for Mazikeen Smith
Hey, hang on I'll grab my paperwork
I'd love to chat with you, Lucifer
Well, I'm terribly busy, Charlotte I'm sorry
It's important
Maybe somewhere a little more private?
Look, I-I really am in a bit of a rush, Charlotte
Of course
I just wanted to mention I met your brother, Amenadiel
Oh, dearie me
I bet that was a snooze
So you confirm that he's your brother?
Well, yes, of course
Well, he had some interesting things to say,
things that you never mentioned
For starters, would've been nice
to know that you were my stepson before I kissed you that night
"Stepson"?
- Right - Yeah
That would've been far preferable, Mum
Mum
- my dear Charlotte - You said "Mum"
Did I?
So I was
I was your stepmom?
Well, not anymore
Look, it it's complicated, Charlotte,
and I am horribly crunched for time, so
Tell me what you know, and don't lie to me
Please, Lucifer I feel like I'm going crazy
Fine
Fine, I suppose you do deserve to know the truth
Okay, then
No sense dillydallying
I really am the Devil
My brother Amenadiel is a former angel
That time you thought you survived
being stabbed by your junior associate, you didn't
You died, and your soul went straight to Hell
Your empty body became a-a vessel
for my real mum, the goddess of all creation,
until her celestial light
started bursting out of your midsection
Naturally, I sent her to another universe
so she wouldn't destroy this one
Once she vacated your body,
you, Charlotte, came back to life
All right? There we are All caught up
You wanted the truth?
Well, there it is
Now, I really,
really must be going, because I have an innocent demon
in the clink, but
if you have any follow-up questions,
please, do feel free to
ask Amenadiel
Maze
How you holding up?
Never better
What do you want?
I'm here to support you
Okay, I-I will never, ever forget
how you helped my brother,
so if there's anything you need,
anything at all, I'm your girl
Even if I'm guilty?
Well, I don't think that you are
Even though there isn't
one shred of evidence that exonerates you
Like, nothing I mean, honestly,
I've never even seen someone look more guilty
But
I have faith in you anyway
Well, there is one thing that you could do for me
Yeah Name it
I could use a hug
Like you even need to ask
Bring it in!
Mm
Oh!
I was just on my way to find you guys
Got the lab results back from the green tea coconut water
No match on the DNA, unfortunately It was
- Demonic? - Inconclusive
But I did find a set of prints
They were yours
Well, if your prints are on that can,
that means someone must've broke into your house
and stolen it from your wheelie bins
What? Your trash
I assume you're the one who throws 'em out for her
And whoever stole the can
could've also stolen Maze's knife Which means
- someone's framing Maze - Someone's framing Maze
You guys, I'm really worried about her
She's hurting When I hugged her just now,
she hugged me back
She
she hugged you?
Excuse me
You supposed to be here, ma'am?
Ms Lopez! I've heard so much about you
Only been here a couple weeks, and everyone says
you're just an absolute ray of sunshine
Yeah, that's me
Rainbows, science, God
Oh, uh, uh, just need your old, uh, John Hancock
and your security PIN, uh, to sign out that file, you know?
Protocol
How 'bout a hug instead?
- A Lopez hug? - Mm-hmm
Oh, I've heard about those, too
Must-must be my lucky day Uh
Oh! Oh, okay
Um, getting kind of dizzy here
Um, okay
Pleasure to really meet you
That other Ella was mean
I can't believe Maze used me
She ruined hugging
Uh, I'll-I'll take that
Thank you Lovely
Go easy on Maze, Ms Lopez
What, like you did?
Uh, look, yes, I admit I was a bit miffed
But that's because I thought Maze was manipulating me
Now it's clear she didn't kill that fellow,
it's obvious someone is manipulating her
Which is a terrible feeling, by the way
We need to help her
Excuse me,
do you know what she was looking for in here?
Maze wanted us to lock her up
- Chloe - She's innocent
The lab results from the coconut water prove
that she's being framed
Then why did she turn herself in?
Because she needed something from this file
The booking sheet from the Vic's recent arrest
Why is the corner missing?
Because that's where the bail bondsman's name
and address was A guy named Barry Hill
He's the one who posted the Vic's bail
- What does she want with him? - Okay, in order
to frame Maze, someone had to convince her
to go to the crime scene, you know, make her think
that she was tracking a normal bounty
That's where she found Mike Biltz dead,
- with a knife in his chest - Yeah
And pulled it out
That's a pretty good frame job
And since Barry the bondsman hired Maze to find Mike,
he's probably the one who set her up
or he probably knows who
Wow
Not bad, Decker
Thanks
Are we okay?
Yeah Yeah, we're okay
Uh, look, we'll talk about it later But I have to go
Oh
Sorry Hate to interrupt the canoodling
Which I am so okay with
It doesn't fill me with mistrust at all
But duty calls, Detective
Can't have Maze taking justice into her own hands now, can we?
- Mm-mm - No
Okay
Hey! What's your problem?!
Hey! Which one of you mid-life crises is Barry Hill?
Get out of the lane, lady!
You're blocking the way of the two-time league champs here
You must be Barry
You're coming with me
Need to ask you a few questions
Oh, well, you know,
I'll give you everything you need
After I roll
So do me a favor, honey
Just stay there and look pretty, all right?
What gives?
7-10 split
Gonna be hard to pick that up with your face caved in
Now, just stay there and look pretty
Okay! Okay, okay!
I'll tell you everything you need to know! Ju-Just let me up!
Just let me up!
Lucifer told me everything
As in everything?
As in the whole freakin' enchilada
As in I was possessed by the goddess of all creation
But it's all good
Because she's in another universe
And you believed him?
No
Yes
I don't want to
I was hoping that you could help clear things up
with one simple question
What's my husband's name?
Um
God
Frey
Godfrey
- You're lying - Charlotte,
I don't know what you want me to say here
Um, the truth
But a truth that makes sense
Because right now, the only thing that feels real to me
is that I was in Hell
And that's insane!
I mean,
you can't actually be an angel
and Lucifer can't actually be the Devil
Because if I believed that, then
then it would mean that I'm insane
Easy, lady!
Okay, what's this all about?
Don't play dumb
You called me to bounty Mike Biltz
And funny thing when I found him: he was dead
Stabbed with one of my knives
Security camera was a nice touch though Made me smile
So why'd you set me up?
Okay, yeah Okay, someone-someone paid me
to call you, but I don't know nothin' about any kni
Who paid you?!
Some corporate guy called me I-I don't know who he was
He said he worked for some place called, um, Sebastian Corp
Sebastian Corp?
What's that?
Well, I didn't see that coming
Long-range round, large caliber
Barry here died from a sniper hit
Ah, it's definitely not Maze's style
She prefers her violence up close and personal, believe me
Guesstimating the bullet's
trajectory, I'd say the killer shot
from across the street
Well, an entire bowling team
saw "that crazy hottie"
leave this office right after the shooting
Which means she wasn't across the street when the shots
- were fired she was here - Yeah
She couldn't have taken those shots
But I'm still mad about the hug
Well, if Maze didn't kill the Big Lebowski here, who did?
Maybe somebody who framed her
was tying up loose ends
But who has beef with Maze?
- My money's on someone she bounty-hunted - Yeah
Someone she caught and brought to justice
Surely those miscreants have the biggest grudge
Well, time to interview Maze's ex-bounties
Oh Fun and games
Hello
Tell us how you know Mazikeen Smith
She hunted me down like a dog
She came from nowhere
S-So, what did she do to you?
She ate my goldfish
Then a rain of many sharp knives
And did she do that?
No, she did this
Oh, dear Would you like some Advil?
What?
- She - Sorry, Detective
Fish caught my tongue
He tried to tell her he already paid his parking tickets
You must have been upset that Maze caught you
Mm Perhaps you hated her
Hated her enough to frame her
No Maze is all right
After she got me, she bought me a beer
She taught me how to make a shiv
out of a toothbrush
And you better believe it came in handy
The nice thing about Maze
she doesn't judge
She's a nice lady
Lucifer's always gonna be in the way, isn't he?
All I know is that they have a real connection
They're a package deal now
It's like
Say you fall in love with a woman who has a cat
What are you gonna do?
You accept the cat
Because she's worth it
Lucifer's the cat
I'd just get rid of the cat
Come on
We have one more
Bloody hell Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
- Mm-hmm - Hello Do you hold a mortal grudge
against bounty hunter Mazikeen Smith?
Nah I should, but no
Maze changed my life
She scared me straight
Oh Really?
What, bank job? Mob hit?
No Winery gig
Way overpaid
Definitely fishy
Maze taught me if it's too good to be true, stay away
Uh, what winery?
Monte De Oro Winery
Gorgeous drive
Very romantic
Lucifer, Margo and Zack are behind this
We got to get to that winery
You really think that they framed Maze
- and killed those two people? - Yes
And I bet Maze knows why
- Thank you - Right Looks like we'll have to stop her
from actually killing someone this time Thank you
Found you
Lady, you framed the wrong demon
"Sebastian Corp"?
Really?
It took me a second after Barry mentioned it,
but then I remembered
Four months ago, I tracked down a bounty named Sebastian
Yeah, real dirt bag
Drove drunk, killed a girl,
and then fled the charges when his rich mommy
and fancy lawyers couldn't save him
Turns out that rich mommy
was you
So why'd ya do it, lady?
Sebastian put you up to this?
Prison not agreeing with Momma's little boy?
Sebastian is dead!
Killed in a prison fight,
the prison you put him in
I had you framed because I wanted you
to suffer like he did
My boy is dead because of you
You blame me?
Sure, why not?
Sebastian's a saint
You're the perfect mom
And I'm just the big, bad, evil demon
And what would someone truly evil do
to the one who framed her?
Best help money can buy
Yeah, I've always wanted to do that
Done that before
Maze, no!
Maze, stop!
Drop the knife This isn't you
Isn't it, though?
I destroy things, Chloe
It's what I do
Friendships,
relationships, apartment walls
And, apparently, I killed this lady's son
Maze, I know you didn't kill Mike Biltz,
and you didn't kill Barry
And her son isn't your fault, either
We're all responsible for our own choices
And right now,
you have to make one
Maze, you don't destroy everything
Trixie loves you
You're the best babysitter she has ever had
Other than the time you let that rock band spend the night,
and when you sent her to school with the pot brownies
But the point is,
no one's perfect
But what matters most
is that you're such a good friend
to Trixie, to me
And I don't know what you're going through, Maze
I wish you would talk to me, but, please,
please put down the knife
Let me help you
Help?
You're the reason he won't take me home
What?
You want a knife, Chloe?
Maze!
Brother, are you sure? I mean, the old you
would never have been okay with this
I don't think we have much of a choice
Charlotte
Do you have a minute?
Sure
Just getting ready to check myself into the loony bin
Charlotte, listen I owe you an apology
I shouldn't have told you what I did
Yes And, well, I suppose
that I didn't help things either
So we are here to make things right
Now, we can't undo what we've already done,
but maybe we can help you move forward
Last chance to change your mind, brother
Going once, going twice
Fair enough
You, um, you may want to sit down
Nah At this point, things can't get any crazier
You'd think
Okay
Oh, no, Luci
We've broken her
Charlotte
Are you okay?
It's it's real
Then that means I'm
I'm not crazy
Hey
Hey
I've, uh, I've been thinking a lot about what you said
About Lucifer, and, um
You know, I need you to know that
he he and I, we're
we're good partners,
and we're good friends
And I you know, I don't want to lose that
It wasn't a fair ask
No It's-it's
it's also unfair of me
to ask you to deal with this, you know?
You want to take me home?
I'll take you anywhere
It's okay You don't have to ride with me
I know I want to
I'm here What do you want?
To apologize
Look, I thought you were manipulating me,
but, well,
I'm a big enough devil to admit when I'm wrong
Anyway, killer caught
Demon exonerated
All good now?
No
Everything that happened
showed me exactly why I need to go back
I don't understand
It's all so
complicated here, Lucifer
I mean, caring about humans always goes wrong
Feelings suck
I am not the one who's supposed to be tortured
You're the one who does the torturing
Yes
So please, just
take me home
I can't And not
just 'cause of possible repercussions with Dad
I
I can't lose you,
Maze
Not you, too
Oh
What do you mean, "not me, too"?
The detective
- Right - I just saw her
ride off with Pierce
She looked so happy
That's what I want, I suppose, isn't it, her happiness?
I just wish I knew that Pierce's intentions were pure
Anyway, point is, you're right
Feelings and humans suck
So
at least we have each other
I'm always gonna be the consolation prize for you
You only care about me
when you don't have Chloe
- Maze, now hold on That's - No
No one puts me first
Least of all you
None of you deserve me
Leaving town?
What are you doing here?
You're angry the people you trust let you down
Hmm
Which is why we should work together for a change
Why would I do that?
I don't even like you
I don't like you either
But at least I won't pretend to be your friend,
like everyone else does
Like I said, why would I do anything for you?
Because
I can help us both get what we want

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
- Previously on Lucifer - God cursed Cain
because he killed his own brother
She's the key to finally getting
- what I've always wanted - Just wish I knew that
Pierce's intentions were pure
If you want to take it slow, that's okay,
but from where I stand, I'm all in
I told you not to talk to Charlotte
She's a human woman
who isn't ready to hear what you have to say
I was in Hell And that's insane
Charlotte, do you have a minute?
At this point, things can't get any crazier
I am done with Earth
in general I want to go home
Last time I took someone on a celestial Uber ride,
the detective almost died
You're afraid of your daddy?
You are gonna regret this
I can help us both get what we want
Where's my money?
I just don't have it I lost it
What do you mean you lost it? Where is it?
What do you want me to say?
9-1-1 What is your emergency?
- Hello? People are fighting in my house - Come on, Kevin
Kevin, stop
Oh
Good morning, Detective Decker
- Good morning, Lieutenant Pierce - Hey
Have you seen the evidence closet?
Uh no
Wow
This is a great closet
And, um
Oh, yeah
Get some, Decker
Look at that
It's always nice to start the day
nose to nose, isn't it?
Speaking of, you'll never guess
what happened to me last night, Detective
What's that?
I woke up alone
- And? - It's funny because
I usually don't, because I usually
have women over, or men, or both for sex
Okay
Will he be
coming with you from now on?
Because he is killing our banter
Absolutely not, no
Pierce and I only came
Drove together just this one time
One time
- Right - Apparently
the victim's from a well-connected family
The suits downtown want me to keep them in the loop
Don't worry, I won't interfere
with the investigation,
- or the, uh, dream team - Uh-uh
Now, if you'll excuse me
Okay Shall we?
Uh you have DNA on your shirt
What?
Oh um
Oh, weird
Hey, Ella, what's up?
You tell me what's up, player
So, dead guy?
There must be an ID
Right
Here lies Kevin Winstead
of the Winsteads
34 years old
The Winsteads?
The wealthy real estate family from New York
Oh So, what's he doing getting killed
in such a crappy neighborhood?
Apparently, he rented a room here
Not sure why he would, but Kevin
was notoriously the black sheep of the Winstead clan
Heroin addiction
Although
from the looks of these healed track marks,
it appears that Kevin might have gone clean recently
Not an easy thing to do
And, apparently, a waste of his time
What was the cause of death?
Gunshot wound to the chest
- Shot during a home invasion robbery? - Maybe
But the killer never got around to taking anything
Got interrupted by the house's owner
Oh, that poor boy
He seemed nice
- Why don't you tell me what happened - I was sleeping,
and I heard glass breaking,
so I went down to check it out
And then I heard arguing
Uh, what were they arguing about?
The voices were muffled, but I did hear someone say,
"Kevin, stop"
So, the intruder knew the victim
The former heroin addict had nefarious friends
- Shocking - Did you get
a good look at the guy?
He was wearing a mask
I would be dead for sure
if God hadn't sent that angel to protect me
So, there was someone else in the house
Not another person
An angel, who saved me
It-it flew in here,
and it just chased the evil man away
I'm sorry, sorry, it's just the only thing
my siblings would chase away are a good time
I have proof
The angel
he took one of my figurines
Hmm? Gabriel
Right
Try lending him some money
Your tune changes rather quickly
Mrs Hernandez, why don't we get you
checked out at the hospital?
- Thank you - Yes
All right, let's do a background check on Kevin
Let's see if he had issues with anybody
Keep an eye out for this angelic witness
Hey, maybe it was one of your brothers
Seriously, is it one of your brothers?
Preposterous
My Father doesn't send my siblings down
to intervene in petty robberies in Pacoima
He only sends them to harass me
Oh, and speaking of
Hello?
Right, I'm here
What's so dastardly important?
Okay, Luci, I think we made a mistake
revealing divinity to Charlotte Richards
We? It was your idea
But now I'm having second thoughts
What if she tells someone?
Oh, no, you're right
'Cause then that person might tell someone else,
who then might tell someone else, which could lead to
absolutely nothing happening 'cause no one will believe her
Okay, look, you might not care, Luci,
but the concept of divinity is too big
for humans to handle
We don't know what she's gonna do now that she knows
And I don't care
You're right
Oh, question, brother
You don't happen to know if any of our siblings
might be in town?
Not that I'm aware of
Ah
Why?
Oh, it's probably nothing
Just an old woman
in some unremarkable home said an angel
broke into her house
Saved her life
Stole one of her hideous figurines
All that trouble for one ordinary human?
Yeah
I mean, it would have to be one very bored
or deeply confused angel
Yea
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
I mean, there must be some sort of reasonable explanation
And you don't remember how the figurine
- got into your bedroom? - No
I mean, maybe it's a housewarming gift or
or a sex toy
Or a housewarming gift sex toy
I just
And it's identical to the one missing
- from that woman's house? - Yes
But it's coincidence, surely
You've been complaining about having weird dreams lately
Including one where you couldn't control your wings
I've also dreamt I was king of the centaur people
Doesn't mean I'm gonna start wearing horseshoes
There have been instances where people sleepwalk
when they're having difficulty dealing with painful situations
Or, inversely, not dealing with them
Is it possible you're not dealing with something,
and, thus, sleepflying?
That's absurd I mean, what in the world
- could I not be dealing with? - I don't know
Chloe and Pierce, maybe? Perhaps you're not as
okay with that relationship as you think
Look, I am not an idiot, Doctor
Clearly, I don't love them together,
But I'm also not a 16-year-old
crying in my bedroom with Adele on repeat
And I'm definitely not this angel
And, I know just how to prove it
This was nice
This was
Crap
Wow, not even remotely close
to what I thought you were gonna say
No, no, the time We got to go
What? Why?
Trixie's gonna be home any minute
And you don't want her to see me here
Look, you're pretty much the first person
that I've dated since Dan
I haven't introduced Trixie to anybody
And I just don't want to do that until I'm sure
And it's not that I'm not sure
I just, I-I want to be ready,
and I want to know You know?
Maybe I shouldn't have said all that
- Anyhow - What's the prob
Listen, fast or slow, whatever the speed,
I'm into this
If you haven't figured it out, Chloe,
I'm in
I like you
Sorry
Oh, it's Lucifer
- Of course it is - Got to go
Ah!
Good, you're here
We need to find the killer
Is this that super important thing
you said you needed to talk to me about?
Yes, because this case is of the utmost importance to me now
- Really? Why? - Because if,
in the miniscule realm of possibility,
that crazy old lady did, in fact, see an angel,
I need to prove that the angel wasn't me
I think I can help with that It wasn't you
Well, I'm sure you're probably right
And when the killer confirms as such,
I'll be one happy Devil
So, come on, chop-chop What do we got?
Okay, two days ago, Kevin checked out
of a high-end rehab facility Sunrise Sands
And according to this incident report,
he got into a pretty nasty fight with a fellow resident
right before he left A guy named Phil Goldstein
Yeah, come on I'm driving
I don't understand why humans waste so much time
resisting their desires
A rehabilitation center for drugs and sex
Mr Goldstein?
Detective Chloe Decker,
LAPD We'd like to ask you a few questions
about Kevin Winstead
The answer's yes he's a douchebag
Did you know that he was murdered?
No, but it's nice to get good news for a change
The admin office said that you were gone
for a few hours last night
during the time of Kevin's murder
So, would you like to tell us where you were?
I went for a drive We're not prisoners here
Can anyone confirm that?
If producing
nine legal shows taught me anything,
it's that I don't have to say jack without a lawyer
If you'll excuse me while I go take a crap
- What are you doing? - Actually,
Phil, I've had enough of your crap!
Now, I know that you killed Kevin Winstead,
and then an angel interrupted your escape
So, tell me, what did he look like?
- Lucifer - Man, what the hell
are you talking about, man?
Did he look like me?!
Lucifer, stop
I did not kill Kevin
But you guys did fight, right?
That is only 'cause Kevin took this rehab stuff so seriously
The rest of us? It's a smoke screen
Keep our wives and jobs at bay
But Kevin wouldn't shut up about
getting clean, getting his family back
He drove me nuts
So I punched him
Get his family back?
I His parents are dead, and he wasn't married
I don't know about any of that
Where were you last night?
Answer her
Uh, uh
Uh, with hookers
That's why I'm in here
I'm a sex addict
- Ah - It's court-ordered
Anyway, you know,
two steps forward,
one step back, right?
Hey, what was that about?
It's nothing
That was not nothing
Talk to me
Look, I just haven't been sleeping well
That's all but never mind that, what's next?
What's next is you take the afternoon off
Get some rest
What? I'd rather go and find the killer
It's not a suggestion, Lucifer
Look, I'm gonna spend the rest of the day
poring through Kevin's file,
trying to figure out who his family is
We probably won't know anything until tomorrow morning
Tomorrow?
Go home You're tired
Okay Fine But, only if I can borrow these
Well, I promise I'll bring them back
Please don't
Ew
Luci
Lucifer
Wake up
Ugh
No offense, brother, but on the list of things
I'd like to wake up to, your face falls somewhere
after a horse's head and Coldplay tickets
I just came to show you this
What?
"The Angel of San Bernardino"?
See, I thought that maybe one of our siblings
was in town
But, Luci,
it appears that, uh
I am the angel
"Witnesses say the unknown Samaritan
"appeared to have wings
Sort of flew in like" This is ludicrous
It-it can't be me
Can it?
Luci
Just look around
Look at your hands
I think it is you, and I think it's all my fault
In what possible way is this your fault?
Because I made you show your wings to Charlotte
Reveal divinity
And now, Father is punishing us for it
Look, Father making me do angelic deeds
is a divine kick in the nuts to me
Well, my punishment must be forthcoming
- What? - And who knows
in what form it will come
Don't be ridiculous You or I aren't being punished
for Charlotte Richards, same as I wasn't punished
for revealing myself to Linda
Okay, well, then, how do you explain all of this?
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?
It's just more manipulation
Quite possibly, Dad's master plan all along I mean,
first, he makes me look the part of an angel
And then, he forces me to act it in my sleep
I don't know, Luci
Well, if working with the detective
has taught me anything, it's that I need proof
Only the killer can say for certain if it was me
So I'm off to work
- Might have a shower and stuff first, huh? - Yeah
I'll get some takeout, because being with you is the dessert
It's a date
Can't wait to see you later
#Dyingofcuteness
How long have you been there?
Long enough to hear how totally adorbs that was
Sounds like things are going really well
They are But
But
There's a "but" in there
I think she's holding back
She hasn't said the magic words
What magic words?
You know
Those three little words
Rhymes with "my guv boo"
She hasn't said them, yeah
You and I, we're the same
The rock that people break themselves against,
and you know what happens to rocks like us?
When we fall, ooh, we fall really hard
Kind of a scary place, huh?
But don't worry, LT
When the time is right, she'll say them
And, when she finally does
Everything will change
I'm counting on it
Hmm
Your casserole tastes like roadkill
Oh, and you
Stop telling stories about your children,
'cause no one cares
Hmm, Sally
Oh, Charlotte
It's not the clothes that make you look fat
It's the fat
- Ugh - Yeah
Oof And you
You are pretty great, actually
Uh, thanks?
And you
You are coming with me
Okay
Mrs Bell, this is a copy
of your son's birth certificate
It says that Kevin Winstead is the father
Kevin and I dated years ago
We were going to get married
after I got pregnant with Jackson
But I called it off at the last minute
- Jackson, stop - Oh, no, no, no!
- No, no - No, no, no!
- Get off the floor - I got it
Yeah, and people choose to procreate
I'm afraid my son has Kevin's temper
But you are
the one with the assault charges
I did my share of drugs with Kevin
I'm not proud of who I was then
Right
The drugs made you wild
Which is why I stopped using
But Kevin liked getting high more than he loved me
Our relationship became toxic
So I left
And when was the last time
- you spoke to Kevin? - It's been years
'Cause it says here on the phone records
that he called here three months ago?
Every now and then, he would call, asking for money
For drugs So, whenever I would see
his name on the caller ID,
I would just hand the phone to Jeremy
And did Kevin mention having trouble with anyone?
A drug dealer, maybe?
Last time we spoke, he said
he owed somebody a lot of money
I didn't care to ask who
Right Well, I'm not saying this was a complete waste of time,
but it was
Mm So so then,
I said, "You can stick that brief
in the circular file under your robe"
Hint: it's his butt
Aren't you worried about the fallout?
I had a big revelation recently,
and it's completely changed my perspective on
well, everything
It's liberating
Another round
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no
No, thank you
- I should go - Relax
You only live once
Or
twice, in my case
Look, I would love to, but if I show up back to work
completely hammered, there's gonna be hell to pay
I got you covered
I'll put in a word with the big guy
With Pierce?
No, think bigger
The commissioner?
It's an anadrome for D-O-G
I love how weird you are
But I should go
Or, you could duck into that closet,
take off all your clothes
I'll go freshen up
Meet you in there
Then, do the same
That's really not a good idea
Come in
Oh
What are you doing in here?
Uh, I'm was
- I'm calling the police - No, no, no, no, no, no
Don't do that, don't do that, please
I am the police
If I could just, um
Right there
I don't understand Why is it taking so long
to find Kevin Winstead's drug contacts
on your computer thingy?
It's easier said than done, Lucifer
Well, the man is a degenerate
He must have been arrested a thousand times
Rich families like the Winsteads, they're all about appearances
And they've been covering Kevin's run-ins with the law
since he was a teenager
Look, getting a hit, it might take some time
So why don't you go home, get some sleep and
Look, I can't
Why?
Because if I am this Angel of San Bernardino,
and I go to sleep, then I might do it again
Okay, well, just don't sleep then
Hold on
That is an excellent plan, Detective
I'll just never sleep again
Ah
Oh!
Perfect Harder
Again
Oh!
Come on!
Ha, ha!
Put the first layer in
Another scavenger's coming
Hey, Bones, look at that
Mary, right?
Why do you care
about my relationship with my father, Booth?
Look, I'm glad you called
Um, but it's just gonna take some time
I'm still upset, and so is Trixie
I know
I'm fine to take it at whatever pace you need me to
Fast or slow
Whatever it takes
Wait, what did you say?
"Fast or slow" Why?
It just nothing
Reminds me of something someone else said
Well, if you go by someone else's pace,
it shows how much you really care
That's incredibly insightful
I learned it from sex
That's more you
All right, well, thanks, Maze
Ha
I got your text
Where have you been all week?
- Has it been a week? Huh - Yes
Um, hey, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine Fine Rough night, juice cleanse
So what have we got, Booth?
Booth?
Yes, the FBI agent on Bones
- The TV show? - Uh-huh
Watched all 12 seasons It's riveting stuff
It's like watching a documentary of us
Actually, you're clearly Booth
- I'm Bones, obviously - Obviously
Kevin's autopsy report Good
Now, I've been thinking,
perhaps there was a slight depression on the occipital,
or slight fractures to the femur?
Did you know there were 206 bones in a human body?
Each of them a clue, sometimes twice
And the coccyx is not what it sounds
No coccyx
What I did find was surveillance video
of Kevin getting arrested for possession a few months ago
Oh, goody
- Okay - Mm-hmm
So who's his doltish
- sparring partner? - Uh,
Matt Kessman, per the arrest report
- Kevin's dealer? - Uh, I guess so
I spoke to Kessman's roommate
He said he's "doing a job" at the Vido Hotel right now So if we hurry
Oh, so if we hurry, we could catch him in the act
Yes, use it as leverage, get him to talk about Kevin's murder
Onward, Boothy!
Excuse me, everyone
If I could have your attention, please
Oh, excuse me
In the ER
- Thank you - That's Matt Kessman
I fix people's hearts with a scalpel
Some say it's a miracle
The real miracle here
is how Sheila fixed Kirby's heart
Let's hear it for the happy couple, huh? Cheers
I find it strange that a heart surgeon
has roommates, and that he's slugging it out
in an alleyway with a junkie
Detective, I've seen that man before
What? Where?
He's the killer I'm certain of it
- What? - Yeah
Thank you
Stop what you're doing LAPD
Tell me, you murderous drug dealer
Was it me?
Uh, drug dealer? I'm a heart surgeon
Don't even try lying to me
I know you killed Kevin Winstead
And I know you killed that intern at the hospital
Yeah Burned her body
Only her cranium was left in the smoldering, smoldering ashes
Lucifer
Lucifer
Are you talking about an episode of Bones?
Wha?
Oh, yes
Oh, yes, no, I suppose I am, actually
Yes, episode 306
"The Intern in the Incinerator"
Yes, of course You were quite good
- Thank you Thank you - Yeah
Yeah, that wasn't an easy role
I thought you were a heart surgeon
- Um - This is all my fault
I don't have many friends
Any friends
So I hired Matt
to be my best man
Make it look like I know fancy people
Can I go back to my wedding now?
- Uh - Yeah, go ahead
You were arrested at the park for fighting with Kevin
So why? Did he owe you money? What?
We were fighting because he wouldn't do any drugs with me
Because that's the job I was hired to do
So I-I don't understand So Kevin was your drug dealer?
I'm an actor Times are tough
I was hired to be Kevin's friend
Just like the groom
But instead of giving best man speeches,
I was supposed to keep him nodding out
Eh, partying
Who hired you to carry out this ridiculous charade?
No idea I-I got the job through the agency
that sets it all up
They're called Masquerade, Inc
Breaking and entering will get you five years
You'd have to catch me first
So, you ready for me to kill you yet?
No And you can stop asking me
I'll let you know when the brand is finally gone,
but don't worry, I think it's soon
Well, I did my part
So what are we thinking?
- Pain or no pain? - No pain
I've had enough painful death in my time
Let's keep this last one quick and clean
No pain it is
Not for you anyhow
What?
Decker's the one who's gonna suffer
I got to admit, getting her to fall for you, and then,
poof, vanishing ruthless
And that's saying something coming from a demon
Respect
I don't care who I have to hurt,
as long as it allows me to finally die
"No family? No friends? No problem"
And for a fee, they'll send actors
to pose as family or friends
at public functions for the sake of appearances
- That's clever - Yeah, well, it's creepy
At least now we know that whoever hired
that exceptionally talented actor from Bones
may well be our killer Hmm?
So, um It says, says here
the Masquerade office is in Hollywood I'm driving
Lucifer
I won't be able to get a warrant until tomorrow morning
No No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It-it is imperative that we go now
It's imperative that you sleep
You clearly
I can't sleep!
Detective, I can't sleep
Lucifer
- I've had it - What you won't understand, really
- Hmm? - It's my wings They're back
My Father, he's manipulating me
He's making me do things that I would never do
What? Like flying through the night,
helping people like some rogue angel?
- Yes! Yes, exactly! - Uh-huh
That is the only plausible explanation
Either that or Linda's right, and I'm suppressing
pent-up feelings about you and Pierce,
which is obviously absurd
You hate that I'm with him
I couldn't care less that you're with that insolent dullard
We both know that's not true,
but what I want to know is why it bothers you so much
Because, Detective, I happen to know him better than you,
and I know that you can't trust him
Care to elaborate on that?
I Yeah
Fine, I will, because you deserve to know the truth
Yes, okay
Pierce isn't Pierce
He's Cain from the Bible
And he's immortal He's been around for eons
And all he cares about is ridding himself
of that stupid curse that my Father put on him
- Because he killed his brother - Stop Stop!
- You're tired, and you're not thinking clearly - No
No, I'm it's not because I'm tired, Detective!
And
But since you brought it up,
let me tell you what I think about Marcus
He is a good man
who treats me right
And I'm happy, Lucifer
And all I know is how I feel when I'm around him,
and, you know, I l
I
We're done here
Seven carats
of pure bliss
Don't you deserve a little indulgence?
I'll take it
Hey
You got a second?
For you, Amenadiel, always
Don't go too far
Dan called me He's worried about you
Well, all is good In fact, it's better than good
It's perfect
Yeah, what about that Spartan lifestyle?
What can I say? Things change
And why is that?
Because when you know
a pair of angels that can
zip you up to Heaven when the time comes,
worrying is a waste of time
That's not how it works, Charlotte
- What do you mean? - Okay, look
Neither I nor Lucifer have the power to get anyone into Heaven
I don't have my wings,
and Lucifer, well,
he is, uh, most unwelcome
So the only thing that matters,
Charlotte, truly, is who you are
It's okay
Nothing's changed
No, don't you see? That's the problem
The second I thought I had a free pass,
an excuse not to be good,
I relapsed into my old ways,
into who I really am
There's no hope for me
Amenadiel, I can't change
I'm going to Hell
- Mommy - Hmm?
Did you know if you're ever mean to me,
I can just go on this site and order a new mommy?
Oh, yeah? How you gonna pay for that?
Your credit card
I've gotten pretty good at your signature, you know
I don't doubt that All right, come on
Let's go get some pizza and ice cream
on the way home
He seems nice
He is nice You know, Monkey,
since Daddy,
I haven't really dated anyone well, seriously
And, uh
Marcus and I,
we've been spending a lot of time together
And the truth is I like him, a lot
And it's just so important to me that you're okay with that
Is he the reason you've been so happy lately?
I think so
Does he like chocolate cake?
You know what, I don't know
Let's ask him
All right
Oh, my God
What is it, Mommy?
That's Jeremy Bell
The husband we interviewed
Hello?
Anyone there?
Trouble sleeping?
Mr Morningstar, what are you doing here?
Shh It's probably best not to wake your family
Even though
they're not your family
I just came from Masquerade
where a most cooperative employee
helped me connect the dots
So, you used to be an actor
We're in LA, everybody used to be an actor
Mm-hmm, but not everyone gets such a cushy gig, do they?
Your so-called wife
worried she'd no longer fit in with the classes
after she broke it off with her deadbeat baby daddy,
hired you to play husband and father
Murdering to keep the gig?
That seems a tad method, don't you think?
Murder?
Th-That's crazy
All right, look, you need to leave
or I'm gonna call the police
Oh, please Spare me the theatrics
because I am in no mood
to hear the half-baked recitation of innocence
by a, well, mediocre actor
Was it mediocre acting
that got Mary to actually fall in love with me?
And Kevin's reappearance just put all that in jeopardy
Yeah, I wasn't about to let that loser
weasel his way back in here
Just like I'm not gonna let you mess it up, either
Too bad you're trespassing
What the hell?
Most kind of you to admit your guilt
The trying to kill me part, less so
Aah!
Now, tell me what I really want to know
- Am I the angel? - What angel?!
Did I stop you from killing that old woman?
What happened the night you killed Kevin?!
Okay I'll tell you
After I shot him, I ran out
I bumped into that old lady
But there was nobody else there
She fell into some kind of religious trance so I bolted!
She saw an angel!
- Was it me?! - No! I
It was a-a shadow from-from those figurines
With the figurines, the angel figurines Did you plant
- the figurine in my bedroom?! - No, no
I-I touched one of them
So I took it, but it had my prints on it
I destroyed it right after I swear
Then how
I was only trying to protect my family
It was never your family to protect,
you pathetic imposter
You stole it
from Kevin Winstead
And then you kept him distracted
by hiring someone to keep the party going
Driving him to self-destruction,
stoking the very fires of his own weakness
to keep him out of the way
How could I be so blind?
Jeremy Bell? LAPD
It's all my fault
I killed Kevin Winstead
I am a pathetic imposter
What are you doing?
I need to find it, Maze
Find what?
Your self-respect?
The-the angel figurine It's here somewhere
I-I need to find it so that I can
convince the detective that Pierce
isn't who she thinks he is
What? I don't understand Explain
I figured it out, haven't I?
Pierce has been gaslighting me
He's been tricking me into thinking
I've been doing good deeds in my sleep
Why would he do that?
Because
to keep me away from the detective
so he can pursue her
He must be back to thinking that she's the key to lifting
his bloody curse
I mean, I tried to warn her,
but she wouldn't listen, would she?
And why wouldn't she listen?
Because the detective always needs proof
And what better proof than that trinket that he used
to-to-to deceive me?
Wait
If you want Chloe to believe you,
you have to do it right
Take it to Ellen Have her do her lab thingy
Yes, yes, you're right
First, back up Tell me everything
Start at the beginning
And don't leave a single thing out
It's just
so hard to put everything together in my mind, Maze
I mean, you-you wouldn't understand
Thank you
That's very kind of you
Which is not like you at all
Why are you even here?
You're helping him Aren't you?
"Helping him"?
This was my idea
After Pierce told me
about that old lady who thought she saw an angel,
that's when it all came together
I planted the figurine by your bed
My neck is still jacked from wearing those fake wings
to save that dumb family
in San Bernardino
You came this close the other night to waking up
after I took those handcuffs off
Thankfully, handcuffs in bed, I got that
Why would you do this to me, Mazikeen?
Because I know the only thing
that matters to you more than Chloe
You
Easiest way to spin you out
Tap into those daddy issues
"I can't get rid of my wings
Daddy's controlling me"
Wah, wah, wah
You're stalling me
Aren't you?
I need to get to the detective!
Hi
What do you have?
You're lucky you're cute
because I hate surprises
Come on Let me see
To celebrate solving a murder
Mm, my second favorite kind of six-pack
Thank you
And this
I'm more of a key lime pie guy myself,
but every proper bribe requires self-sacrifice
Trixie is gonna love this
- It's her favorite - Hmm
She's at a birthday party right now
Oh, birthday party
Maybe she's already had enough cake for the evening
Well, then maybe we can all share it together
tomorrow morning for breakfast
You mean I don't have to sneak out of the house in the morning
like a teenager?
- Mm-hmm - Are you sure?
Oh, I'm sure
Yeah I-I'm done walking on eggshells
I'm done worrying about how this affects everybody else
because the way that I feel about you is
just don't get a big head
All right? We're both adults
and it's not that big a deal
But anyhow, here it goes Um
I really
like spending time with you
And I know why
Because, Pierce, I l
Stop
I can't do this
What? Wait, no
Marcus, don't freak out
I mean, I know that this is scary,
but sometimes you-you just
have to take a leap of faith You know?
Hold on
Did something happen?
Did is it something I did or said?
Because, look, we can take this slow
I just thought that
You're just making this too hard
What?
It's not worth it
I'm not worth it?
- I have to go - What?
Why?!
Why did you hurt her? Why?!
For the first time, I had it
It was right there in my grasp
The one thing I always wanted
It was so close
I just had to have her say the words
But I couldn't
I couldn't do that to her
I couldn't
hurt her like that
Well, you hurt her plenty
And now?
I'm gonna hurt you
Get up Come on
You do what you have to do, Lucifer
I deserve it
Your mark
it's gone

- Previously on Lucifer - Is it possible
you're not dealing with something? Chloe and Pierce?
Perhaps you're not as okay with
that relationship as you think
Decker's the one who's gonna suffer
Getting her to fall for you and then vanishing?
Ruthless
I don't care who I have to hurt,
as long as it allows me to finally die
Neither I nor Lucifer have the power
to get anyone into Heaven
There's no hope for me
I'm going to Hell
And I am sick
of that stupid little brat of yours
Pierce, I lo
Stop
I can't do this
What?
Why?
Why did you hurt her?
Why?!
I couldn't hurt her like that
Your mark It's gone
Just like that it's gone?
I don't understand How?
How the hell
did you finally get rid of your bloody mark?!
I don't know
I guess the plan worked
What plan?
The plan to get Chloe to fall for me
And why would you have a plan for that?
'Cause I finally figured out what makes us vulnerable
Us?
It's Chloe's love
Think about it
She loves you, you bleed
Now she loves me, so I can die
Well, congratulations,
'cause you've just come to the most absurd
conclusion I think I've ever heard
Is it?
I tried to stop her from saying the words
I didn't want to hurt her
I guess I was too late
She already loved me
Well, allow me to disabuse you
of your misguided notions
Regardless of the detective's possible affections,
I think the reason that your mark is gone
is glaringly obvious,
isn't it?
The moment you chose to pull the ripcord
on your dubious plan,
Dad chose to screw with you
By giving you exactly what you wanted
I mean, come on, really It's God 101, isn't it?
I really wouldn't be so sure
Well, you know what? Who cares
why your mark is gone
The point is that you,
my mortally challenged friend, can now die
So just say the magic word
and I'll be I'll be happy to help you on your way
Yeah? We'll go old school, shall we?
Come on!
Let's rock and roll!
Stop
I got it
Are you sure?
'Cause really, really, I don't mind
I've got it
Fine
Suit yourself
- I guess this is good-bye - Yeah
But, on the bright side,
see you never
Hey, Ella, do we have, uh
the-the forensics on the Duckworth case?
Dope shades, missy!
Thanks
Yeah, I only wear mine inside when I'm like, super hungover
or, you know, for some reason I've been crying
Right
Oh, no
What happened?
It's
Pierce and I broke up
What?
- Yeah - Why?
You were so great together
Uh, yeah I I don't know
I guess he just, he freaked out and he ran
I-I'm guessing
he's terrified of intimacy I
I'm just trying not to take it personally,
'cause it's not like this is the first time this has happened,
so I just
wonder if it's something I'm doing
No way
That is some bull to the crap, right there
Okay, anyhow
I'm gonna walk into Pierce's office
and I'm gonna give that studly, big-armed man
a serious what for
Hey
Please do not say anything
All right? It's just gonna make things more complicated
Fine
Okay, I-I won't interfere
How could you do this to her?
You made her so happy!
If you must know,
I was trying to protect her
I broke things off
because I didn't want to hurt Chloe
I know you're my boss, so don't take this the wrong way,
but do you know how stupid that sounds?
If you really cared about her,
then what are you protecting her from?
I guess nothing anymore
I can actually be with her
I can grow old with her
Uh, maybe
I mean, that's a little
cart before the horse, don't ya think?
No, you're right, Lopez I totally screwed this up
Yeah You did
- I need to win her back - Mm-hmm
How am I gonna do that?
I have faith
- Good morning! - Morning
Detective, uh, as someone who goes to therapy,
I understand you must have many
feelings following last night's debacle
So, if you feel the need to discuss
No, it's okay I really don't want to talk about it
Excellent I mean, you know,
whatever works for you works for me
After all, if all goes as it should, we'll probably
never be hearing from that lying lieutenant ever
again
Shouldn't you be, uh, I don't know,
having tea with Hitler by now?
Change of plans I don't want to die anymore
I want to win Chloe back
I beg your pardon?
No time to explain
Okay, I know you probably hate me right now,
but please, just hear me out
You were right, about last night I got scared
Things got very real between us and I
I couldn't handle it Okay?
And I'm not used to feeling this way
And I realize that now and that's why
I promise it'll never happen again, because
because I love you
What?
I love you, Chloe
Wh-What do you expect me to say to that?
Well, that you love me, too
Look, Marcus, as much as I appreciate
hearing you say those words
that's what they are: they're just words
I can't trust them anymore
Our victim is Reina Markova,
29, prima ballerina for the LA West Ballet
four years and running
Cleaning staff found her when they came in this morning
Any witnesses?
Uh, no She's known for taking rehearsals alone
Especially when she's two days away
from a big premiere like Giselle
Hmm Hey, Ella
Any idea of the time of death?
Looks like she was killed roughly ten hours ago
Oh, what a coincidence
She's been dead almost as long
as your dreadful relationship to Pierce
They broke up?
Actually, he broke up with her
- Okay - What about cause of death?
Right
Well, according to
the ligature marks on her throat,
she was strangled
using the ties from this
She was killed with her own shoe?
Not her shoe Different size
But why leave the murder weapon behind?
Maybe whoever did this freaked out and ran?
- We've seen it before - Oh, yes, we have,
from the lowest form of scum on earth like Pierce
Well, come on
I mean, we're all thinking it, aren't we?
Anyway, time to get the slipper back to the lab
Any other questions, here's my prelim
Uh I'm gonna join her, 'cause
because this is awkward
Oh, and, uh, personally,
I'm with you, buddy
Screw that guy
So, we're searching
for a murderous Cinderella
Yes, someone timelessly evil
Almost like a cretinous lieutenant named
Enough, Lucifer
This murder has nothing to do with Pierce
Well, not literally, perhaps
I know you want me to hate him
To tell you he's terrible
But the truth is, our relationship
is none of your business
- Former relationship, you mean? - Yes
- Yes - No, no
- No? - I-I don't, I don't know
Point being, you need to back off
Whether I decide
to take Pierce back or not, it just,
it has nothing to do with you
Or maybe it still does
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
Great news!
The detective still makes me bleed
Which means there's hope
Uh, hope for
Well, for the detective, of course!
Hope that she hasn't fully succumbed
to that intolerable knob, Pierce
Even if he has lost his mark
Pierce lost his what now?
Allow me to catch you up
So, the lieutenant has a ridiculous theory
that, shockingly, may hold water
He believes that the detective's affections
are what make me vulnerable
And now that she cares for him
Well, long story short, old ham hands isn't cursed anymore
He's mortal
So, your vulnerability is proof
that Chloe cared for you
but now she cares for Pierce,
- so now he's vulnerable, too - Close
She cares for Pierce and me
As proven by my bleeding
Yet, for some inexplicable reason,
she's on the fence between the two of us
And how does that make you feel?
Well, it makes me feel
like I
like I need to tip the scales in my favor
Show her
which side the grass is greener on
And why do you want to tip Chloe to your side?
Because, as her partner,
it's my duty to save her from making a terrible mistake
Uh-huh
Pierce has clearly blinded her
with his charming oaf routine
So I need to open her eyes
Show her that I'm better than him in every possible way
And what if Chloe does choose you?
Well, then, things can finally go back to the way they were,
before Pierce, obviously
Uh
Why do I feel like I should've stopped him this time?
What the hell is this?
It's pretty self-explanatory
- The plan is off - Why?
We were so close to getting happily-sexed Decker
to fall for you
Yeah, and I messed it up, okay? I broke up with her
You broke up with her?
What happened to getting rid of your mark?
Doesn't matter
I'm done with grand plans and manipulations
I don't want to use Chloe anymore
What about what I want?
Because if we don't get Chloe to love you,
then we can't lift your curse
And if we can't lift your curse,
then I can't kill you and hang it on Lucifer
Framing Lucifer for murder
is the only way to blow up his life on Earth
Keep your voice down
What don't you get?
My side of the plan doesn't work without yours
And I need this
to get back to Hell
I'm sorry Like I said, the plan's off
Says you
Detective
Pardon my tardiness,
but I come bearing gifts
What is this?
Well, I know how you like your seasonal beverages,
so I got you a "Luck o' the Irish" Latte
and oh! To be sure, to be sure,
little something extra
Oh, y-you got me a lemon bar
Mm, well, they're your favorites, aren't they?
- Mm - Look, Detective,
I know that you're going through a difficult time right now,
and what you need
is someone who knows you
I know It's just
- Um - It's just what?
Ooh, lemon bars My favorite Mmm
Oh, man, these are amazing Who made 'em?
Uh, Pierce did
Would you believe that hunk bakes?
On second thought, who needs the empty calories?
Hmm
Hmm, looks like someone
is trying to crawl their way out of the doghouse
Mm-hmm
- Is it working? - Yes, is it?
Let's just focus on the case
Ella, what do you have?
Uh, so I got a lead off the murder weapon
No match on the DNA, but I did find a signature of sorts
The ballet shoe had traces
of olive oil, Evian and beeswax
So our killer's a bumblebee with expensive taste?
Or a ballerina
Dancers all have their own unique way
of prepping their shoes
And, according to her social media,
guess who uses those exact ingredients?
Reina's former understudy
and LA West Ballet's new prima ballerina,
Amber Fontaine
So either she took out her competition
or the killer somehow got one of her shoes?
No, no, no, definitely looks like a Black Swanto me
And bras and up Ladies, arms out
Sorry to interrupt
We'd like to speak
- with Amber Fontaine - For what?
We're extremely busy here
Yes, us, too
Solving the crime of a brutally murdered ballerina
But Amber didn't have anything to do with that
And we only got two days
- to get this show up and running - Easy, easy, Gwen
They're just doing their jobs
I'm sorry
We're just all pretty emotional right now
Yes, clearly some more than others
We know it was your shoe
that was used to strangle Reina
That's crazy
The killer must've stolen them out of my locker
I mean, Reina's locker
Look, respect for going full Tonya Harding,
but if you're gonna kill someone,
you should get your story straight first
No, Reina's locker was mine for, like, a week
when she left the company for her new gig
But when she came back, I had to return it
I-I must've left my pointe shoes in there
- Where were you last night? - Home
Sleeping like a baby You can ask my roommate
Now that Reina's dead,
I'm back to being tied in knots
Yes, murder can do that
No, as much as I thought that I wanted
her spot, to be able to dance with a legend like Miguel,
I-I wasn't ready
I was happy to keep learning from Reina
I thought it was our gain and their loss
Whose loss exactly?
You know, America's Next Prima Ballerina
The TV show Reina was gonna host
You know, I'm inclined to believe our young ingenue
If there's nothing she and Reina were competing for,
it makes her motive far less compelling
Yeah, we need to look into this TV show,
see why she turned it down
Well, it certainly wouldn't be art over commerce
No one has that kind of passion
Are those from
Marcus Yeah
Bastard
Luci, what is so urgent? Why'd you call me here?
Because enough is enough It's time
We need to get rid of Pierce
What exactly do you mean by
"get rid of Pierce"?
Well, what do you think I mean?
Yeah, we're not gonna kill him, Luci
I know, angels can't kill humans,
yadda yadda yadda
Spare me the lecture Besides, killing Pierce
isn't the answer anyway
because, inexplicable as it is,
the detective actually cares for the man,
and breaking her heart isn't the goal
I got to admit, I'm a little fuzzy on that one myself
What is the goal?
For the detective to realize she needs to pick me
over that blithering clod, Pierce, which
gah, shouldn't even be an issue, but
- I'm in - You are?
You are my brother and my test
Whatever needs to be done
Well, I have to admit,
I didn't expect that to be quite so easy,
but I'm not one to look a gift-angel in the mouth,
I'll take it
So what's the plan?
We need to make the detective realize
that Pierce isn't the man she thinks he is
We need to prove to her
that he is a two-faced, loathsome biblical liar
I mean, how hard can that be?
He is the man behind the whole Sinnerman thing, after all
Um what?
Oh, I'm sorry Didn't I tell you?
Fun fact: Pierce equals criminal mastermind
Anyway
You run with that, and I'll keep working on the detective
Read my lips:
Dance is pain
You want to feel sorry for yourselves?
Then go back to Kansas or wherever you're from
That is Myles Druker
Only one of the most amazing choreographers in the world
Choreographer with a bum leg?
Is this one of those, "those who can't, teach" scenarios?
He was a dancer who lost his leg in a car crash
But he never believed in playing the victim
Instead,
he turned his tragedy into an inspirational story
for all of us to follow
He's also the creator of America's Next Prima Ballerina,
the show that Reina was gonna host,
until she reneged on her deal and it cost him a fortune
Right Well, I don't see why
he wouldn't take such a loss in stride
- You see what I did there? - Mm-hmm
In stride?
You must be aware that Reina Markova
was killed last night
Yeah, I heard Big whoop
Well, for a potential cold-blooded killer,
you're being quite obvious
I mean, I just don't think Reina was much of a professional
Then why'd you hire her?
Let's just say I was pressured
into our collaboration
By whom?
By none of your business
Look, I'm a very busy man,
so unless you're gonna charge me with anything, we're done here
Well, actually, no
I just have one more question
Uh, take note, Detective
Here's something I can do that other people,
rhymes with Shmierce, cannot
Tell me,
what is it that you truly desire?
- I wish - Yeah
That car crash never happened
Why? 'Cause it crushed your leg?
No
Because it didn't crush my leg
Oh!
Right, well
Care to explain?
Everyone believes the accident ruined my career
Well, the truth is, it made it
I built my brand on the notion
that I could overcome anything
I walk around with a prosthetic every day
covering my real leg
Polypropylene
Oh So is that why Reina left the show?
She found out you were a fraud?
No, she quit because I accused her of blackmailing me
I was sent an e-mail
with a video that exposed me
You know, with two working legs
Said that if I gave Reina a job, the video would disappear
So I did
But she didn't send it?
Apparently not,
even though it was sent from her e-mail address,
because when I confronted her, she went ballistic
Said that she didn't need any handouts and quit right there
But if she didn't blackmail you, then who did?
Beats me
Right Well, you better not be pulling our legs
What are you doing here, Charlotte?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm a terrible person that's
that's led a terrible life, so I'm
I'm preparing myself for damnation
In a three-star hotel?
It's what I deserve
Well, it's time to sober up
I need your help with a legal matter
Don't you want to ask someone less damned?
I don't think so
I need to find a way to prove
that Lieutenant Pierce is the criminal mastermind
also known as the Sinnerman
Say again?
Lieutenant Pierce has been leading a double life
for quite some time now
I need to prove it,
and then I need get him out of the picture
so that Lucifer can be with Chloe
I'm gonna need a little bit more information
A very long time ago,
God tasked me with blessing a couple with a miracle child
Now, that child became Chloe Decker,
who, it appears,
was placed on this Earth
to cross paths with Lucifer
Now, since Lucifer is my test,
bringing those two together must be my final task
At which point,
hopefully I'll be restored in my Father's eyes
Okay, let me see if I understand this correctly
I help you,
I help enact God's will?
In a way, yes
And could that
put me in His good graces as well?
Maybe
Good enough
I'm in
And I think I know how to get started
Well, I'd say that was rather impressive, wouldn't you?
I exposed a fraud of a man and got us a lead
It's like the whole world is pointing towards,
well, me, today
Yes, Lucifer,
very impressive
Unfortunately, until cyber traces
this blackmail e-mail,
we have nothing to do tonight
Oh, nonsense, nonsense The night's still young
Why don't we, um, I don't know,
- go for a drive? - For a drive?
What are we, 80? Why would we go for a dri
Ta-da!
I mean, it's not flowers, but
it does go zero to 60 in, well fast
You
- You got me a car? - Mm-hmm
Wait, do you think this is some sort of competition?
Of course If it isn't painfully obvious,
anything Pierce can do, I can do better
It's not about stuff, Lucifer
Thanks anyhow
Good morning
Good morning?
Last I checked, didn't you move out?
It's mea culpa time
I came to earn my way back
into the house
Really? And how do you plan on doing that?
Well, I tried to think of something nice,
but that's not really my strong suit
But then I heard you and Pierce broke up
So, I figured he hurt you
Maybe I just hurt him back?
Thanks, but-but no
I mean, at least not yet
Ah
Men are so fricking confusing
Yeah, they're dumb Really dumb
Mm-hmm
What happened?
Well
one minute, things with Marcus are great
- Mm-hmm - And then the next,
he ends things, and, uh
And now he's doing all of these
really, really sweet things to win me back
And it does seem really nice,
but I just don't know if I can trust it
I don't know, ho
How do you know if you can trust people?
It's simple I can't
People will always let you down
You know what I do trust? Pain
And I admit,
Pierce is in a whole lot of it
What? How do you know that?
Well, I may have already gone to his house to kick his ass
before it occurred to me I should probably
have asked for permission
- Maze - But I
I stopped myself So there's that
Oh, Pierce was putting on a brave face,
but dude was hurting
Hey, Mom, what's for break
Hey
It's gonna take a little time
Hey, Dan, what's up?
Cyber came back
Turns out the blackmail e-mail Myles got
pinged to an apartment registered
to a William Sterling
Chairman of the board of LA West Ballet,
well-known surgeon, married, two children
Why would he be trying to get Reina a new job?
Uh, maybe he was trying to get the company some press
Who knows?
Uh, what's the address?
- Lucifer - Detective
Good morning Please,
- come in - What are you doing here?
Well I realized that you were right
It's not about the stuff that I can give you,
it's about actions
So, I decided to get a jump on the case
and take a few things off your plate
Which, I might add, is the opposite of Pierce,
whose job it is to put things on your plate
- Uh-huh Where's Sterling? - Not here
Which is convenient, as it's given me time
to learn a few things about our, well,
slightly deranged suspect
Lucifer, did you break in here?
Detective
I'm disappointed you'd think so little of me
Would you believe it if I told you
an attractive neighbor with a key simply let me in?
Unfortunately, yes
Excellent Then, on with the tour
So, I have come to the conclusion
that we are inside the lair of a creepy stalker,
evidenced by photos
of Sterling with Reina
Clearly photoshopped
Uh, some of her
undergarments lying around
Don't want to know how he got those
And, um for the grand finale
a shrine dedicated to Reina's old costumes
Probably liked the smell of her old sweat disgusting
Lucifer, I think
Sterling is a lovesick obsessive
who wanted to see Reina's star rise?
Yes, me too But clearly his gift
of a shiny new job wasn't met kindly,
and so he
Aha!
Ha, I caught you, you sicko!
What did I say, Detective?
Actions, not stuff
Lucifer, let him go He's not a stalker
He and Reina were having an affair
Isn't that right, Mr Sterling?
Uh
I never met anyone quite like her
She was the love of my life
You mean, the love of your Tuesday afternoons
and occasional Saturday mornings, don't you?
You are married, with offspring,
are you not?
You don't always get to pick who you fall in love with
Is that why you blackmailed Myles Druker,
to show Reina how much you cared?
I don't know what you're talking about
There's a blackmail video that was sent from Reina's e-mail
It was pinged from this physical address,
and that's why Myles hired her
And when she found out, she quit
Did she confront you? Rebuff you?
'Cause it can be quite daunting
when somebody doesn't appreciate your gifts
Perhaps you,
oh, I don't know, lost your temper
Uh, that's absurd I didn't care
who Reina worked with
I certainly wouldn't hurt her over it
But if you didn't send the e-mail,
- then who did? - Mm
I don't know
Maybe someone snuck onto her computer
- Is that her computer? - Yeah
Who else knows about this place?
No one, I thought
Guess I was wrong
Okay, well, we're gonna need to
take the computer into evidence
I cannot believe
how well this is working out
I mean, finding Pierce with a known fence?
Who knew the LAPD could be so helpful?
Well, the LAPD didn't help with this
I called in a favor, had Pierce's phone hacked
Charlotte!
If I wanted to break the law,
I wouldn't have gone to a DA
And if I hadn't cut corners, we wouldn't be here
as quickly or efficiently or as Well, hell, who cares?
We're working for God now Right?
Well
can't argue with results
Okay, I think we got what we need
Uh, not exactly
I'm afraid all that you have are a few photos of an envelope
If we want to expose Pierce,
we have to find out what's inside
Aw, crap He's on the move
Well, maybe we
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need to borrow your bike
Don't worry, it's for God
Who are you?
Why are you following me?
I said, who are you?
Ms Richards
Why are you
Following you?
Well, it seems I let my better judgment
get away from me
I don't understand
It's complicated
See
when I heard that you and Chloe broke up,
I started thinking about you
I know how hard it is
to be stuck in a dark place
Sometimes, all it takes is the right person
to get you out
After all
we both have needs
Another time
Hell, I'd be the luckiest guy in the world,
but I'm in love with Chloe
Sorry
I know we knew what was on this video,
yet somehow actually seeing Myles' fake-fake leg
- So much grosser - Great
The man's an embarrassment
to both dance and prosthetics
Well, we're just lucky that cyber could retrieve this
from Reina's computer
Dan, is there any way to tell who made this from the footage?
Nothing, no voice Not even a measly cough
Whoever did this was pretty damn careful
Yeah, we're still waiting for DNA results
from the computer's keyboard,
but if the killer wore gloves, I mean, we're out of luck
It's Pierce
Well, someone needs to hit "ignore"
We'll get it
Hey, Pierce, what's up?
Chloe, hi
Listen, I realize that lemon bars and flowers
aren't gonna cut it
I think I figured out a way to prove to you
you can trust me
Can you meet me at my place for dinner tonight? 8-00?
Eh, I don't know
Chloe, please
Listen, if you don't want to see me after,
I promise I will never bother you again
Just just come over
You gotta eat, right?
Okay Yeah, I can do dinner
Great I'll see you then
- Detective - Hmm?
I couldn't help but overhear a part of your call
and I understand that you're torn,
but before you make a decision
about Pierce I'd like the chance
to express some thoughts to you, as well
Okay Go ahead
Right, well, I
Actually, can we do this in private?
My place, one hour?
Uh okay
Lovely
Detective
Thank you for coming
I thought you were having me over to tell me something?
Well, all shall be explained in due time
But please, take a seat
Now, I hope you like
chateaubriand
Um
Lucifer, what is all this?
This is to help you
make an appropriate decision about your future
and, dare I say,
our future
Now, we've been through a lot, Detective
But now the two of us are alone in front of this beautiful meal
in this romantic setting, I can finally
ask you the question I brought you here to answer
and I hope, well, I hope you can answer honestly
Isn't this better than anything Pierce could do?
You did all of this to to show up Pierce?
It's impressive I know
Detective
Those aren't tears of joy, are they?
Why are you doing this to me?
To prove to you that you shouldn't be with Pierce
Why do you care who I'm with?
'Cause he he doesn't deserve you
Then who does deserve me?
Someone
someone better
You can't have it both ways, Lucifer
Detective, I
Hey, Dan What's up?
We got a lead
So, DNA on the computer came back negative
So, we decided we had to watch the creepy leg video again
But that's when we saw it,
hidden in the window's reflection
It looked like one of those Magic Eye pictures
- You know the ones where it looks like - G-Guys, what did you see?
- Oh Yeah - Oh, right Yes
We are sending over the enhanced image as we speak
Recognize that costume?
Okay, we know Miguel is behind the video,
but what I don't understand is why
Why would he risk everything
just to get rid of Reina?
Well, isn't it obvious?
He wanted to be with her
There
Why did you do it?!
Why did you have to take Reina away from me?
Answer me Why did you kill Reina?
Drop the weapon!
You had no right! You had no right!
Wait!
Don't you see?
He didn't want to kill Reina
Lucifer, get back
He tried everything to simply
get her out of the way
All those times you came to pick her up
She was your friend
How could you hurt her?
I thought he cared for her
Yes But she was also an obstacle
to being with the woman Miguel loved Amber
But why kill Reina?
Because she found out I was trying to blackmail Myles
She was gonna get me fired
And then he wouldn't even be able
to work in the same company as Amber
Why didn't you just tell Amber how you feel?
Tell her the truth?
Because
I was afraid
Afraid she wouldn't love you back
But I do
I-I do have feelings for you, Miguel
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry
To think
you could've had everything you wanted
All you needed to do was tell Amber how you felt,
but you blew it
And so did I
It's got to be around here somewhere
Oh, I got it
It's empty?
I don't understand
Was he on to us?
I mean did he destroy what's inside?
Maybe he just took it with him
I'm sorry, Charlotte
We did everything that we could
We're just too late
Don't be ridiculous
If I believed in "too late" I wouldn't be doing any of this
No, we are not giving up
After all, you don't quit when you're doing God's work
I'm so sorry
Ever since you left my office, I've been struggling
between my role as your therapist
and my concern for you as a friend
Friendship won
But too late, it seems
Well, I royally screwed up this time, Linda
Turns out
I'm just as bad as our killer
Oh, God You killed Pierce?
No
No
But I did try everything to get that lovesick, former immortal
out of the picture when really all I should've done
was told the detective how I felt
how I really feel
Then why don't you?
I can't
What are you so afraid of?
At first it was your devil face
What now?
You don't want Chloe to see that you have wings?
Who cares?
- I do! I care! - Why?!
Because she doesn't have a choice, does she?
Neither do I!
It's all part of His master plan to toy with us,
to make us dance for His bloody amusement
That's an excuse
Don't you see?
You're doing the same thing as Him now
By not telling Chloe the truth,
you're taking her choice away
No
No
No, it's different
You know, the truth is
no one really knows what your dad's responsible for
We're all just guessing
Even you
But you know the one thing He can't control?
What you do in this moment right now
So I ask you,
the Devil
what do you truly desire?
I want her to choose me
Then tell her
Yes
Yes
I'm sorry for just stopping by,
but when you didn't make dinner
No, I, i-it's I'm sorry
This case has, you know, been
It's okay
I can say what I need to say here now
Okay
For days I've been thinking about how I screwed up
Tried to figure out how to make things better
When you find that person who gives life meaning,
Chloe, nothing else matters
Okay, well
I know you don't trust me I know I've made mistakes
I've made an eternity's worth of mistakes
But please, let me spend the rest of my days
making it up to you
What? What are you doing?
Chloe Decker, will you marry me?
Yes

Previously on Lucifer
What do you desire?
I want her to choose me
I never told you what I want I want you
So you thought I wouldn't find out your mark is fake
Maybe not tonight, but I am coming for you
Neither I nor Lucifer have the power
to get anyone into Heaven
I'm going to Hell
Well, I was hoping that you might be able
to help me out again
Any chance to get in His good graces, I'm in
I know you're not trying to freak Chloe out,
but you're getting in her head
- Let's elope - I can't marry you
I'm sorry, Marcus
- Oh, no ring - No ring
Hey
You know, I'm really glad that you told me how you felt
Oh, I don't know
All that unresolved sexual tension?
It was kind of fun
They're gonna burn the house down
if we don't get out there
I made the batter, Dan
Oh, yeah?
Well, sweet, because the waffle king has arrived
Step aside, my lady
Good morning, Micah
Thanks for your help
Hey
Are you okay?
Is it the same nightmare?
Except this time, you were in it
So
are you going to tell Chloe now?
Tell her what?
Uh, everything
What we talked about in your penthouse
before she got engaged?
When you said, "I want her to choose me"
Right Yes
No, no No need
She broke it off with Pierce, so I win
Yes, I know that they broke up,
but just because she didn't choose Pierce
doesn't mean she chose you
And just because she un-chose Pierce
doesn't not mean she didn't choose me
Point is,
no need to rock the boat
I mean, we all know how the detective gets
when you push her
Plus, you know, she's on the rebound
- Those are excuses - I think
it's best if everyone involved just goes back to normal
Easier said than done, Lucifer
Yes, you may be right
Maybe I should do normal
rather than just say it
Huh? Help speed things along a little
Ah Another nugget
Thank you, Doctor
Yep
Back to normal
Is that really Forest Clay's wife?
Chloe
Before you say anything,
I just really want to apologize for
the event that should not be named
- The what? - The bachelorette party
from hell I-I got caught up
- I acted selfish Just - Ella, it's fine
- And - Is that someone playing piano?
I think so
At a crime scene?
You look familiar Have we met?
What?
Then you ask if I like to play cop
And I say, "No, I like to play in general,"
Detective, except you were on the other side of the piano
That's right, yes That's what we said when we first met
- Yeah - What are you doing?
I'm reminding us both of a life less complicated
You know, before all that
Lieutenant-shaped nonsense
So we can go back to normal
For example, I'm sure you remember this little ditty
Come on, take the top line, Detective
Don't be shy
Lucifer For once,
I agree with you, and I would love nothing more
than for things to go back to normal
Oh
As long as it means we can get back to work
Yes, absolutely
A mystery waits to be solved
Onwards, Detective
Oh, anyway,
I just really want to apologize
for ruining your engagement, Chloe
You know, I-I made it about me
when I should have been listening to your needs
You know, what I need is to move on
Agreed There's no point dwelling in the past,
so let's all move on
by moving even further back, shall we?
I mean, they're not breast implants,
- but in a pinch - Oh, oh, oh
No, no, no No, no, no Whoa, whoa!
- Whoa oh! - Oh!
No, no, no Please stop Please stop that
- Thank you - Why? What, they're not evidence, are they?
'Cause I wouldn't be the carefree rogue of yore
if they weren't
Not evidence
- Just priceless historical artifacts - Ooh
Okay, this baby right here is from the World Series
Everyone remembers Gibson's home run,
but Clay
pitched a shutout in Game 2 that was like, boom!
Take that, bitches
Hmm
Wait, do you not know who Forest "King" Clay is?
- No idea - Cy Young Award
World Series MVP
Beloved American legend?
Is that lock broken?
Ella, you think this might be a home invasion?
Yeah, I know I thought that, too, but unis said
that it didn't look like anything was taken
Was Devon home alone?
No Forest was here, too,
but medics took him to the hospital for a head injury
Apparently the killer knocked him unconscious
Boom!
Take that, bitches
Lucifer, what are you doing?
Oh, right You're smoking pot
because you smoked evidence that one time
next to that suspect's car
Oh, you remember Yes
And the time at the teen rehab center
Is it taking you back? It's taking me, well, somewhere
Can you
Guys
I've got a casing
Oh, well, that is perfect, Detective
My shenanigans leading to a break in the case?
That is quintessential Deckerstar
And the eye roll Now you're getting it
We did it, Charlotte
We split up Pierce and Chloe
Yay
Sorry
Truth is, I don't feel any different
And if Hell is definitely based
on your own guilt, then I'm still screwed
Look, we did a good thing
And it's important to celebrate the tiny victories
- along the way - Right
But how will I know when it's enough,
Amenadiel?
How will you know?
Well, we're very different, Charlotte
I'm an angel
I'll know when my wings are back
What about until then?
Aren't you just as mortal as I am?
Well, I su I suppose you're right
If I were to die right now, I'm
I'm not even sure that I would go to Heaven
If that's the case,
then there's definitely no hope for me
That's where faith comes in, Charlotte
Hope in the face of hopelessness
But faith?
Angel or not, what I'm hearing
is that you're pretty much as clueless as I am
Maybe we're not so different, after all
My God, it's Forest Clay
Who's that?
Ah, it's just some famous athlete
whose wife was killed
That's Forest Clay
Oh, I didn't have you pegged
as a sports fan
No, from my nightmares
My Hell loop
If his wife is dead, he did it
He's the killer

I was in the kitchen,
eating leftovers
I saw a reflection on the fridge,
and I thought it was Devon
But when I turned around, all I saw was
a gun, a-a mask before I was hit in the head
I woke up on the kitchen floor,
and I ran to Devon
But she was, uh
There was so much blood
I-I
I couldn't stop the bleeding
You don't have to do this right now
No, I
I want to
Did you see anything that could help identify him?
No
I don't understand who would do this to Devon
It was him Forest killed her
- Why do you believe that? - 13 years ago,
I was an associate at Wheeler Law
I'd only been there for a few months when my boss,
Ben Sr, shows at my place in the middle of the night
He handed me a duffel bag
Told me simply
to incinerate it
He said it was for an important client:
Forest Clay
Well, what was in the bag?
I don't know
He told me not to open it or to ask any questions
And honestly, I didn't want to
Here's the thing, though
There was dried blood on the outside of that bag
I'm certain of it
Yes, but it's quite a leap to thinking
Forest killed someone then or now, Charlotte
After years of working at that firm, I know
how they operate
Deep down,
I know what I helped cover up was murder
I believe her
Really?
- Mm - Why?
Well, which quintessential response would you like?
The obscure enigmatic one
or the blunt nonsensical one?
How about the truth
Well, when Charlotte had her mini-death, she went to Hell
Forest haunted her Hell loop
and now is haunting her nightmares
Which, sidebar,
Dan is also a part of,
so things are heating up there
Oh, well, that sure is nonsense
Oh, don't worry The detective won't believe me
See? It's classic us
Look, I know it sounds far-fetched,
and what Lucifer just said is flat-out insane
- Eh - Anyway,
if Forest killed someone 13 years ago,
the odds that he killed again are not unrealistic
Please, just look into it
I will do what I always do,
which is investigate everyone involved
But until I get a new lead,
I will start with Forest
Textbook, Detective
Very good
Brother, what are you doing here?
Personally, I'm avoiding the, uh, boring forensic part
of the case, like I normally do
But you don't day drink
Something Charlotte said made me think
Oh
Maybe celestial beings and humans
Luci, maybe they aren't that different
What, are we talking in bed?
'Cause we all know my skills are preternatural
But I suppose you, on the other hand
I'm talking about the rules of Heaven and Hell, Luci
It's all based on humans' subconscious,
what they think they deserve
What if that applies to us as well?
Right That's enough for you, drunky
No, listen
When I first lost my wings,
I thought Dad was punishing me
And then I thought that you were somehow my test,
that in helping God's most wayward soul, that I would
somehow find redemption
But, Luci, I've just been guessing
Dad never told me any of those things
Since when does Dad ever tell us anything?
That's exactly my point, brother
What if He wants us to judge ourselves?
So my wings, your wings,
your Devil face
Brother, what if
we're the ones who control all of it?
Brother,
that is absolutely absurd
Dad holds the reins End of story
Because if we do have control,
why don't you just pop your wings out right now?
Hmm? Excuse me
We might need some room here Go on Be an angel
Listen, I'm not sure
I-I still haven't figured that part out
Well, I'd stop trying if I were you It's exhausting
No, actually, on second thoughts,
ponder needlessly, 'cause it's what you normally do, isn't it?
No financial scandals,
no personal accusations
The only nefarious thing Forest ever did was steal a base
This guy's as squeaky clean as they come
Well, someone is
a dirty little liar
I was checking out Forest's medical report,
and something didn't add up
He said that the killer knocked him out with a gun, right?
Yeah
Well, bam!
Or should I say,
no bam?
- Hmm? - If a cut
is caused by a blunt object,
there's a presence of tissue bridging within the wound
Plus, there'd be pretty major bruising
if it was caused by something that knocked him unconscious
- But there was neither - So what caused the wound?
That right there, my friend, is an incised cut
caused by something sharp
Bottom line, Mr Clay's nose
is as long as a Dodger Dog
He lying
Maybe Charlotte is onto something
Careful, Mr Clay
Physical activity may not be wise after, you know,
being hit on the head
Detective, hi
What's this about?
Well, Forensics looked through your medical report
You weren't hit with a gun
Well, maybe I didn't see it right
It happened so fast Maybe it was
Maybe I should just jump to the old chestnut
where you tell me what you desire
I just don't want anyone to find out
What, that you killed your wife?
No, no, no I Th-That I wasn't even there
Ah
The night of Devon's murder
I was with someone else
Ooh A mistress
What was her name?
Mia Hytner
I bartend at the West Hills Country Club
Okay And is that how you met Forest?
Yes He came in a lot, even though he hardly ever drinks
- Ugh - Anyways,
before I knew it, we were
Hitting a home run?
Digging into the dugout?
Slamming it out of the park?
So you confirm that you
and Forest were having an affair
and that he was at your apartment
the night that Devon Clay was murdered?
- Yes - And how did he hurt
- his head? - Things can get a little
wild
in bed with us sometimes
That night, Forest fell
onto the nightstand,
and he shattered the lamp
That would explain the sharp cut that Ella described
Yes And furniture-breaking sex
doesn't exactly fit with Forest's saintly image
- And explain why he lied about it - Mm
Try not to judge Forest
too harshly
He wasn't the first
to cheat on his marriage
He would never tell you this,
but Devon had been having an affair with her CEO for years
Was she, now?
- Thank you - Thank you
Only one way to sneak up on a demon
Let her think she's sneaking up on you
You see, I knew
it was only a matter of time before you found my new digs
Killing me
won't send you home
Keep talking
The only way you can get to Hell
is if Lucifer flies you down
And the only way he'll do that
is if we destroy his life on Earth
That's why framing Lucifer for your murder
was the perfect plan
Until you weaseled your way out of it
Well, I have a new plan Or, rather,
same plan, different victim
Who's the new sacrificial lamb?
God's favorite son
You want me to kill Amenadiel?
Not exactly
I want you to bring him to me
Alive but weakened
Throw me a soft pitch
I'll kill him
You want your mark back
Exactly
There's no better way to piss off God
than killing his favorite son I get what I want
Then we frame Lucifer, and you get what you want
- It's a win-win - Why do you need my help
if you're the one who has to do the killing?
Well, Amenadiel's angelic powers might be gone,
but he still managed to kill me nine times when we fought
Now that I'm mortal
there's no do-overs
I mean, come on, you're a demon
He's an angel This is what you do
Unless your time on Earth changed you more than I thought
and you're not the merciless badass you used to be
Nothing's changed
I'm in
Devon was the heart and soul of King Clay
I can't tell you how hard it's been
Emphasis on the "hard"
- Excuse me? - We have reason to believe
that you were having an affair with Devon Clay
That's crazy
Look, I get it
Being with a married woman,
knowing she could never leave her husband
because of some stupid company,
his giant face staring down
at you all day I mean, it can be torture
working side by side with somebody that you have feelings for
Especially if you have to deny those feelings, squash 'em
You know, it can be unbearable
Yeah
It sounds awful
But that was not the situation with me and Devon
We were just putting in a lot of hours at the office
We have to hit the shelves before the knockoffs do
Corporate espionage is a real thing
Actually caught a spy casing this place just the other day
Really? Did you press charges?
Unfortunately, no He ran off
- when security approached him - Did it occur to you
that he might be stalking Devon and not your sneakers?
No, God Do you think
I think I'm gonna need to see all of your security footage
Yeah Right this way
Dr Canaan
Pleasure
My office is right this way
I really hope you understand just how grave
the incident was You're in experienced hands
The firm handles cases like this all the time
Really?
Oh, yeah
How many cases of misdiagnosed chlamydia are there?
You'd be surprised?
I'm not going anywhere
- Get out of my way - Excuse me one moment
Not until I talk to Wheeler!
- Ben! - Charlotte, what-what's going on?
When I left this firm,
you asked me why
The truth?
It's because I found out
that there are real consequences to what you're doing here,
what we did here
You tell yourself
that you're defending the innocent,
upholding some oath, but you're pretending
All of you
Everything you conceal, every lie you tell,
it adds up
You're just as guilty
as the criminals that you represent
Hell is real
And, trust me, all of you are going
You need help, Charlotte
And so do I
Where the hell is security?
Thank God
I don't think God's on your side, Ben
It may be too late for us,
but at least I'm trying to fix things
Maybe you can try, too
Oh
My apologies for the interruption, Dr Canaan
Shall we continue?
Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't think this is the firm for me
Old password still good?
Sure is
Got him
Four separate times, as a matter of fact
But our facial recognition software's coming up with squat
because of his hat and sunglasses
Average height,
average build, no visible scars or tattoos
I mean, even his shoes are so boring
Mm, no wonder he's stealing sneaker secrets
I'll go back over the footage tonight Maybe we missed something
You Dan Espinoza?
How dare you
Hey, hey Actually, uh, that's for me
Whew
- Ah Well, this is like old times, isn't it? - Thanks
Let me guess, human head or bomb?
Wager, anyone?
Funny
No This is
for
Charlotte
Ta-da!
It's a waffle maker
See,
I-I make waffles
And hers uh, iron is really old
I'm, like, the waffle king?
- Is it weird? - Very But I'm glad
to see you're back to your normal douchey ways, Daniel
Well, it's between that and
this
That's pretty
- It's a waffle - Oh
- That's better, right? - It's still weird,
but yes, women tend to prefer jewelry
over household appliances
Not really sure Lucifer's
the authority on what women want
This is amazing See this?
These are nondisclosure agreements
Forest Clay and
14 different women
Spanning two decades The last, Mia Hytner,
barely a week ago
Question: How does this prove that Forest is the killer, though?
Well, 300, 400 grand a pop I mean, no one spends
that kind of money unless they're trying to cover up
something really bad
Wait
Joanne Foles
June 22, 2005 That's right around the time
I got rid of the duffel bag I remember
"24-year-old found strangled in a motel"
No way the timing is coincidence
Forest killed that woman, and the proof of it
- was in that duffel bag - Yeah,
but not even one mention of Forest here
Yeah, you're right
I may know that Forest did it,
but I still can't prove it because of what I did
Hey, at least
we have the victim's name now Maybe that's gonna lead us
to some other proof
Tiny victories, remember?
- Hey - Dan
I can come back
No, no I should get going
Thank you
Hi
Maze
What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Everything
It's all ruined
I have no one, Amenadiel
And I don't know how that happened
Maze, I don't know what you've been going through,
but it is never too late
to fix things
You can always
be forgiven that is in your hands
And, um
well, for what it's worth,
I will always be here for you
Hello
Hi, Lucifer!
Oh, perfect you're exactly where you need to be
Who is up for a classic game night, hmm?
Well, actually, it's a school night for her,
and I was just about to go over
- the King Clay security footage - Remember, all work
and no play makes the detective a shoe
- Lucifer? - Hmm?
This is this is a little weird
Well, if by "weird," you mean you're transported
to a simpler, happier time, then agreed
Uh, no, no, no, I'm afraid that won't do you landed
on the little question mark last time, so come on, do over
Mom's right, this is weird We can't play
the exact same game as we did before, Lucifer
It's not fun
Isn't it?
Sorry, but
I should finish my book report
Yes, and I should get back to work
But don't you want to paint a unicorn on my cheek?
Well, hold on, wait
- Um - There we go
- Okay What? - Come here Come here
Lucifer!
What are you doing?
Here we go
Wait
Lucifer, stop
You liked this before, didn't you?
Yes I did
It
it meant a lot to me, actually,
which is why I don't understand why you're doing this
Are you making fun of us?
No No, I'm trying to remind us of how great we are together,
to help us get back to normal
Right
Well, uh, you know, I thought I wanted that, too,
but
maybe we can't
Or at least maybe I can't
Look
right now,
normal, it just hurts
Detective
I-I think you should go
Hey, I got something
- You do? - Yeah
Okay, I cross-referenced
the times the suspect went to King Clay
with Devon's schedule
Two of the four days, Devon wasn't even there
But guess who was
- Forest Clay? - All four times
the skulker was there Right on Forest's heels
So what if Forest was the intended target all along?
What if, what if Devon just got shot by mistake?
Wow
That is a great theory
- Yeah - Uh, are you okay?
Yeah
Yeah
Well, I I couldn't sleep last night,
so I stayed up all night working, and, you know,
I drank a lot of caffeine Like, a lot
Was it because of Pierce?
No
No I I don't think any of this
is really about Pierce
I think if I'm honest with myself
all of this is about Lucifer
Lucifer's the the reason
that I said yes to Pierce, and
he's also the reason that I said no
Wow, again
I'm just so sorry that I got wrapped up
in the whole idea of beautiful "Pecker" babies
that I forgot to check in with you
Like like, really check in with you
- Ella, it's okay - Tell me
what I can do for you right now
Uh, you can help me focus on work
- You got it - Okay
So, if Forest was the killer's actual target,
what's the motive?
I think I know
That's AJ Agholor
In 2005, he went to jail
for the murder of Joanne Foles
But AJ didn't do it
Forest did AJ's motive was revenge
How did you figure all of this out?
This is a list of women that Forest paid off for the last 20 years
And look
Joanne signed a $300,000 NDA on June 22
She was killed on June 25,
- the same night I got the bag - Charlotte,
this could all be a bunch of coincidences,
especially to a jury full of Forest Clay fans
Yes, but a lot of coincidences is a pattern
And here's the kicker
AJ got out of prison just three weeks ago
Motive and opportunity
It all fits
All right We got to find this guy
Where's Amenadiel?
I decided you were wrong
Killing Amenadiel won't get your mark back
God isn't a drive-thru
You can't just order what you want
No
You chickened out Gone soft, like I thought
Know what? I'll do it myself
Where do you think you're going?
How's that for soft?
We found this in your car, AJ
It matches the casing that was found next to Devon Clay's body
Now, I don't think you meant to kill Devon
I don't I think that you were following Forest for weeks,
you broke into his house when you knew he'd be home alone,
only he wasn't
Devon surprised you You panicked,
and you shot her
You've been in prison for 13 years
for a crime you didn't commit
It's understandable that you would want revenge
Yeah But not for me
For Joanie
We were gonna get married She broke it off
- For Forest? - Yeah
Only she didn't tell me that was his name back then
She was too scared
Scared?
He used to hurt her
She said she was gonna leave him
Then one night, she calls me crying, screaming
Next thing I knew, I'm going down for murder
- When did you find out that it was Forest? - When I got out of jail,
I went to go see Joanie's mom
She told me that's who Joanie was dating when she died
Did she, or you, have any proof?
Mm-mm
Damn
More hearsay
Ah, Charlotte
Who's that?
He killed Devon Clay
Long story
So the detective caught the bad guy
Without me
All right, thank you
Yeah, he's not the real bad guy
Thank you
I know you're gonna say there's still no proof
No, I wanted to say thank you
Thank you for helping me solve this case
And I might have an idea of how to solve yours
Okay Time out Time out
Geez I won't go after Amenadiel
You won't?
You're probably right it wouldn't work anyway
I had to kill you before, but now I just want to
Okay, you could kill me, sure, but Linda would die, too
- You're full of it - Maybe I knew
you weren't gonna follow through,
so I needed a fail-safe
Liar!
Call her Tell her to look out her window
Now I'm
really gonna kill you
Hey, get me a beer, will ya?
Hello, Forest
Charlotte Richards, what are you doing here?
Oh, I just stopped by to tell you
that I know about everything
Everyone, actually
Stephanie, Diane, Jaylyn
about every woman that you abused
and then paid off
Most recently, Mia, of course
She told me how you actually got
that cut on your head
I told her how you were getting rough again
How you started to strangle me
I tried to get you to stop, but you wouldn't
So I pushed you
And you hit your head against the lamp
How much do you want?
Money?
Well, a pattern
of domestic abuse going back decades is pretty bad
But murder?
Whew, let's see, carry the one
Yeah, all of it
Murder? What are you talking about?
Joanne Foles Ring a bell?
You can stop pretending, Forest
Cat's out of the bag
Or rather, the bloody duffel bag
Yeah, you remember giving that to Ben Sr, right?
Well, see, hmm,
he gave it to his young
and hungry first-year associate: me
And here's the thing, I kept it
I thought it might come in handy someday
I'll get my check book
Turns out I'm a pretty smart lady
Not that smart
Knock, knock It's Lucifer
Come to save the day
Everybody stay calm
Just get back and I mean it
I mean it!
Forest, let her go
Hey, I didn't mean to kill Joanie
It was an accident
I'm sick I need your help
Thanks for your help
I am not gonna help you this time
Hands up
Let her go, Forest
Was that enough of a confession, Detective?
Yes We recorded everything
It's over, Forest
Let her go
Turn around
Wow
It's a good place to celebrate
Yes, it is
I have been coming here ever since I realized
that this may be the closest
to Heaven that I'll ever get
Hmm
Me, too
You know, I've been telling myself
that I've been doing God's work
But, uh, if I'm honest
I think I've been doing it all for myself
To get my Father to give me my wings back
But you know something, Charlotte? I think, uh
I think I'm the one who took my wings away
Great We're both broken
Yeah
Well, I guess angels really are just as flawed as humans,
or at least I am
Hey, at least we have each other
Tiny victories, right?
Tiny?
Uh, may I point out
that you just stopped a serial abuser?
A murderer
Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact
that he hurt a lot of women
No
But because of you
he will never hurt anyone ever again
And I'm pretty sure that you didn't do that
just for yourself, did you?
Maybe not
Well done, Detective
And, uh, point taken
What do you mean?
Well, you put away not one, but two bad guys today
All without my help
So it's become very clear that you
well, you don't need me
That's okay, Detective,
because with that realization
came another
Hmm
If you don't need me,
then we've been working together
all this time because you want to
Because you choose to
You did choose me
You were right
I've been trying to go back to the way things were
You know, playing our greatest hits,
because I've been avoiding dealing
with things in the present like
how I feel about you
I was afraid
Afraid
that you'd want me 'cause you've only seen certain sides of me
That if you saw all of me
knew all of me,
you would run away
Lucifer
- Detective, it's true - No
The other side of me is it's bad
It's monstrous, even
But you wanted the truth, and you deserve the truth
Right now, I can't show it to you,
so I'm just gonna have to tell you
Detective
Chloe
I am the Devil
No, you're not
Not to me
Oh Oh
Let me turn this off
Right
Oh
Oh, it's
I'm so sorry I have to take this
Of course, no
Yeah
Detective, what's wrong?
Hey, just hold on, Charlotte
I'm, uh, I'm gonna get help
I already survived death once
I think twice is asking too too much
No You're gonna be okay
Why did you do that?
Why did you jump in front of me like that?
It wasn't for myself, that's for damn sure
Will you s-stay with me?
Yes
Yes, I promise
Let's go home

Previously on Lucifer
I'm really glad that you told me how you felt
The one man I've cared about, I still gave him up
That's how much I care about our friendship
Go to hell
Chloe Decker, will you marry me?
Lucifer's the reason
that I said yes to Pierce
He's also the reason that I said no
Okay, you could kill me, sure
But Linda would die, too
I was afraid
that if you saw all of me, you would run away
Chloe, I am the Devil
No, you're not
Not to me
I have been coming here ever since I realized that
this may be the closest
to Heaven that I'll ever get
Let's go home
I'll never get to see her again
I know
I still can't believe it
Well, at least you'll get to see her, Detective
Eventually In Heaven
But I well, sadly, she's gone somewhere
I simply can't follow
You know I'm here for you, right?
And I you, Detective
How's poor Daniel?
Hmm, about as good as you could expect
He's throwing himself into work,
but so far we've come up empty
No witnesses
No security cameras up here
Hey, Ella
You have anything?
Uh, no, nothing yet
I'm trying, I-I really am,
but there's, uh, no DNA,
no fingerprints
Uh, bullets are nine millimeter
Pretty common, so that's not helpful
Who would do something like this?
Okay, everyone, I know this is hard
But time is of the essence Lopez, I want you
to expand the search area
Decker, build a suspect list
Espinoza
go home
- I need to be here, Lieutenant - Dan
you need to grieve
I will grieve
when it's done
We're gonna find who did this
I'm on it, Lieutenant
Uh, Lucifer, hold back a second
Have you spoken to Amenadiel?
- Why? - Well, I know
he and Charlotte were close He might know something
I can talk to him myself if you have an idea where he is
Well, I think I know exactly where he is
You do?
Yes
I'm-I'm not following
Well, it appears
that my brother got his wings back
How is that possible?
Amenadiel had a crazy theory
Or so I thought
That everything that's happened to us,
him losing his wings, me gaining mine,
even my lost Devil face
- And you believe that? - Well, I didn't
But I'm fairly certain he's up in Heaven now
and took dear Charlotte with him,
so perhaps there's something to it
You think Amenadiel's gone forever?
Well, who knows if he'll ever return,
now he's finally home in the Silver City
Okay No Amenadiel Great
Excuse me?
It's one less thing to juggle
as we try to track down this killer
Right
Oh, wow
The Sinnerman himself returns
You know, the boys will be thrilled
Everyone's ready to get back to business
I'm not back
I just need something taken care of
Any luck so far?
Well, I went through the list
I found the perfect favor to cash in
Should do just the trick
Good work
You okay, boss?
I've never seen you scared
You're right, you haven't
Because I've never been scared of dying before
Of losing everything
But that doesn't make me weak, it makes me more dangerous
Yeah Sure
Okay, boss
Uh
What do you want us to do with the woman back at your place?
I may still need her
Keep her alive
For now
Don't worry
My best men are on her
Linda
Wouldn't worry about your friend, sweetie
You got bigger problems
She doesn't seem that scary
My nose!
She broke my damn nose!
I hope Maze is okay
- Why is that? - Well, I had to book another sitter,
'cause I couldn't get a hold of her
She's Maze
I'm sure she's fine
- Yeah - This is astounding
Who knew Charlotte was prosecuting so many cases?
I know, and she wasn't afraid
to go after the most dangerous criminals
That's our Charlotte
Yeah
Guys
There's something you need to know
Now, it's gonna sound completely crazy,
but I need you to hear me out, okay?
Of course
What is it?
Try not to react
If anyone realizes what we know,
our lives are in danger
Okay Okay What's up, Dan?
I figured out who killed Charlotte
- What? - It was Pierce
What are you talking about, Daniel?
Why would he do that?
Charlotte was investigating him
She was? Why?
Well, that's the craziest part
Pierce
Pierce is The Sinnerman
Dan, listen, uh
I can't imagine what you're going through right now
- But this does sound a little - Insane?
Completely nuts? No, I get it
I know what it sounds like, Chloe, but do you believe me
Daniel's right
- Excuse me? - Pierce is indeed The Sinnerman
I mean, I don't know if he killed Charlotte,
but he certainly seemed mightily relieved Amenadiel was gone
Wait, you knew?
Yes He told me months ago
- What? - You knew?
You freakin' knew?
- Daniel, Daniel! - You
Daniel, like you said
Please, be careful,
people are watching
Okay?
Good? Yes?
This cannot be true Can it?
I mean if you knew this, why wouldn't you say something?
I mean, I almost married him
I mean, I almost married him
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen
No, you said he's immortal,
and that is something completely different
Is it? If I'd told you he was The Sinnerman as well,
- would you have believed me? - I don't know, maybe!
Maybe, because that's something that actually exists,
and not some metaphor that you've made up
I haven't made up anything, Detective,
I always tell you the truth, no matter what
Okay, ignoring
all the craziness, do you believe me, Chloe?
I-I
I don't see anything in here that proves it
Pierce wants to talk to everyone
Charlotte Richards was one of us
She fought tooth and nail
to make sure that our arrests stuck
To make sure that the bad guys stayed off the streets
And now
Pierce doesn't get emotional
Now she's gone
I don't like this He's lying
But we will find whoever did this
We need to get justice for Charlotte
If it's the last thing that we do
He did it, didn't he?
He killed Charlotte
It appears so, Detective
And now he's overseeing the whole damn investigation
How do we take him down?
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - -- <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> --
How do we approach this?
You buy me five minutes in interrogation with that dick,
- and I swear to you, I will break him - Dan
You're gonna need to get a hold of your anger
I know it's not easy
It's the only way that we can bring him down
Can you do that?
Yeah
I can
- I have no choice - Yeah, she's right
Pierce is more formidable than either of you realize
We are talking about the world's first killer, after all
And you No more of your metaphors
- They're not metaphors - We need to focus on Pierce
But when this is all done, you and I are gonna talk
about everything that you've been keeping from me
Very well
Great
What's our first move?
Well, Pierce still needs to cover his tracks,
so if I were him, I'd be looking for a fall guy
This was just found at the crime scene
I totally missed the little bugger
in the first couple of canvasses
I mean, thank God Pierce held off
on releasing the scene until we did a third sweep
We may have never found it
Oh, I guarantee you wouldn't have
Did you find any DNA on it?
Yeah and we got a match
A guy named Steve Chamberlain
That's one of the men that Charlotte was gonna prosecute
A hedge fund manager that was using a charity
to embezzle money
Sounds exactly like the kind of dirtbag
- who would do something this terrible - Hey, Ella,
there's something that I need you to
There's something that you should do
Okay, so if they found this,
at the scene, there's probably more evidence,
so have the team do another sweep
- You got it - We have a lead?
Yeah
Uh, DNA at the scene points to one of the criminals
that Charlotte was gonna prosecute
That's great
Well, keep me posted
Let me know if there's anything you need
Yeah, will do
Espinoza
Uh, yeah, Lieutenant?
Thought I told you to go home
Yes, sir, you did
Well, if I were you, I would still be here, too
If there's anything you need
I need to catch the bastard that killed Charlotte
Good luck
The improv's paying off
Admirable work, Daniel
For whatever good it does
If we don't arrest Pierce's fall guy,
he's gonna know we're onto him
But if we do, then we lose the time that we need
to prove that Pierce is really the one who did it
Maybe not
Think Pierce has gone back to his Sinnerman network?
It makes sense Pierce needs to move quickly,
and there are thousands of people in Los Angeles
that owe him a favor
Well, maybe one of them is in Chamberlain's orbit
If we can figure out who owes Pierce the favor,
maybe we can get him to flip on him
It's a long shot, but
Yeah, but it's the best one we got so far, so
Yeah
I told you not to park under that tree
You need to clean this crap
LAPD
Want to ask you some questions about Charlotte Richards
Yeah, sure
Can we take this inside?
Nosy neighbors and all that
Not sure why you came all this way
I'm not answering any questions without my lawyer
We're not here about the embezzling case
Charlotte Richards was murdered
What?
Yeah And your DNA was found at the scene of the crime
I didn't murder her
- We know - You got to listen to me
I You do?
You see, we think you're being framed
And we'd like your help in trying
to find out who framed you
Is this some weird reverse psychology?
What's your angle?
Never mind I'm calling my lawyer
If you do that, we can't help you
Sorry, but this good cop, bad cop, sad cop thing
isn't working on me
Besides, a cigarette butt is pretty flimsy evidence
He's right A good frame job would need more
Like the murder weapon
- Where would you hide it? - Nowhere,
because I didn't murder her
If you did, where would you hide the gun?
- In my desk - What, that one?
I don't yes That one
You know, it's not gonna be there, because I'm not a
murderer W-Whoa That is not mine
For the last time, we know
Someone planted this gun here
We need to know who had access
to this area in the last 12 hours
- Oh, no - What?
Had a few friends over today, have you?
Oh, just a hundred or so
I think we made a real breakthrough today, Simon
Thanks
A-And I know you're right, Linda
Not everyone's out to get me
Yeah Okay Good
- Are you here to kill her? - No, no!
That's exactly what someone trying to kill her would say
No No, I
Maze, he's a patient
See you next week?
What the hell happened?!
Are you okay?
Yes! I'm fine
Good
All right, we need to figure out
who would get a favor from The Sinnerman
Well, you did bring along your own master of favors
I could suss out who needed one the most
Dude, we don't have time to go person to person
Pierce is gonna start wondering where we are soon
Yeah, you're right
We need to narrow down the list fast
You know everybody here
I mean, who would have a dark secret
that they would want erased?
Uh, everyone
What? It's a charity event
Ah, charity is the perfect way
for criminals to launder their images
Donate a thousand dollars to distract
from the million you just filched
He's not wrong
That guy Sweatshop abuse
Him? Insider trading
Her? Stole the idea for a company from her own sister
So it could be anyone
Everyone here is guilty
Which means The Sinnerman's not very good at what he does
Should've left it to the professionals, namely moi
- Y-You're right - Well, thank you
No, I mean he is good at what he does
If somebody made a deal with The Sinnerman,
he's gonna make their skeletons vanish
And no one would know about their crimes at all
Which means we're not looking for a criminal
We're looking for somebody as clean as can be
Dan
Dan
Who hired you to frame your boss?
What? What are you talking about?
- Dan - You are innocent
And that's a bad thing?
You're the only one who has access to Chamberlain's office
and the only one with no dirty laundry
Now, the woman I loved is dead, so if you don't start talking
Daniel, Daniel! Daniel, Daniel
I understand your anger,
but perhaps a lighter touch
might help reveal the truth faster
I mean, after all, this young man did ask for a favor
from The Sinnerman,
so you must've wanted something very badly, didn't you?
Yeah Tell me
What is it you desired?
I wished I never sneezed
You interrupted me for a stupid parlor trick?
Dan, it's not a trick
I-I don't know what it is, but it works
Calm down
What happened when you sneezed?
I
I took my eyes off the road for a second
And this
this motorcycle pulled in front of me
at just the wrong time
So you killed a biker
and then found somebody who could make it all disappear
I heard about a guy who gave out favors,
so I called him
And the next morning I
it was like it never happened
But it did happen
No matter how much time has passed,
every time I look in the mirror, all I see is
A monster
And then this morning
he called in his favor
How'd he contact you? Would you recognize him?
I never saw anybody
A burner phone showed up
at my doorstep this morning
and everything after was handled through dead drops
All right We're gonna need that phone
Okay
We're running out of time
Okay, so then we buy more We bring Chamberlain in
We let him lawyer up so he doesn't talk
And then what? Pierce works with the pros
There's a good chance there's no evidence on the burner phone
Well, perhaps it's time we asked for some help
Hey I got your text What's up?
I need something from you
Of course you do
I do, too, actually
That's not what I meant I
Hey Hey
You have been through so much
Okay?
You need to go home
You need to take care of you
We got the guy
That's just it I need you
What's up?
I need you to do me a favor
Something you can't tell anyone about
Lopez, you want to come in or what?
Uh
Hey, boss
What is it?
Dan gave something to me
Asked me to examine it,
but told me not to tell anyone
What is it?
A phone?
That's it?
Yeah I mean, he honestly, he sounded
kind of crazy
He was going on and on
about some frame job or something
Huh Well, what all did he say?
Uh, not much more than that
He-he claimed that "people might be listening"
I know, it sounds insane
I-I know he's not in a great place
I told him he should just go home and get some sleep
I'm-I'm really worried about him
It's okay I'm glad you came to me with this, Ella
But I don't want Dan to get into any trouble
He's not in any trouble I promise
Okay
Yeah, it's me
One of my officers is on to you
I don't need excuses
I just need you to take care of it
Hello, Pierce
It's time for a reckoning
What are you talking about?
I know you killed Charlotte
So, why'd you do it, Piercy?
Why kill Charlotte?
I don't know what this is about, Lucifer
We caught the murderer I don't know why you think
The detective isn't here, which means
I'm invulnerable and you're not, so
sit
down
Or I'll make you
Lucifer
For every lie, I will break a body part
I didn't mean to kill Charlotte
It was an accident
I was trying to kill Amenadiel
And that's supposed to spare your life, is it?
You wanted by brother dead instead?
It's the truth
But why?
God took my mark away
I thought killing his favorite son might bring it back
Did you, now?
You know, when I first landed in Hell
I'd just led a rebellion against dear old Dad
I failed
Everyone hated me for it
Myself included, I've come to realize
I felt like a monster
And then, when I looked at my reflection,
there was my Devil face
Your Father's punishment
So I thought, but
after speaking with a sneezy, murderous driver today,
I realized I felt like a monster
before I became one
I think I gave myself that face
You actually believe Amenadiel's theory?
And what about your wings?
Well, I'd just saved Mum, hadn't I?
And I'd decided to tell the detective the truth
I felt better about myself than I had in
well ever
Maybe so much so that, deep down,
I felt like I wasn't a monster anymore
What does any of this have to do with me?
My curse was lifted when Chloe fell in love with me
Yeah You see
I don't think that's what happened
You were willing to sacrifice
the one thing you wanted to protect someone else
For the first time in your miserable life, Cain,
you were selfless
And maybe, deep down,
you felt that you finally deserved
the mortality that you so desperately desired
You fell in love with the detective, Pierce,
not the other way around
She never loved you
Oh, go ahead, hit me
Yeah, be good to see you break your hand
You think you're not vulnerable because Chloe's not here
But guess what, you're still very vulnerable
Oh, please, do go on I like this desperate you
You do have a weakness
Mm
You want to be good
What?
- Help! Help, I'm being attacked! - What on earth are you doing?
- Let go of me - Lucifer's trying to kill me!
No, no What? No No, no, no, no
Let go of me Let go of me!
Leave me alone! I don't want to hurt you!
It's not me that you want!
Get off! Oh
Get off of me!
So you just let him go
You were supposed to keep Pierce distracted,
not confront him in the middle of the precinct
I overestimated my abilities
and underestimated his
It's not his fault I mean,
I wish I'd had a chance to give Pierce a piece of my mind
Thank you, Ms Lopez
When Dan asked me to give Pierce that phone,
and told me the whole crazy theory,
I got to be honest, I had a really hard time believing it
Yeah, well, the fact that you do, Ella, it means a lot
Hey, we're OG
Okay, you ask me to take a leap of faith,
I'm already jumping
But, you guys, when I handed him that phone,
that look in his eyes
I just wanted to tear his damn throat out right there
Okay, so now what?
We have no idea where Pierce is going,
who's still loyal to him
Hell, we can't even go back to the precinct
to run this guy's fingerprints
to figure out who the hell he is
Pierce has completely reinvented himself before
He'll do it again
Disappear forever
Which means our window is tight
- What are you doing? - I'm calling him
- Chloe - Hey
I-I just heard that Lucifer attacked you?
Wha-What's going on?
What did Lucifer tell you?
That you're an immortal
That, uh, you're Cain from the Bible
Just a bunch of, uh, uh, crazy stuff
It's all true
Hey Marcus
are you okay?
I'm fine
It's good to hear your voice
Yeah, you, too
Where are you? I'm worried about you
Lucifer's next to you, isn't he?
Espinoza, too?
What? No
You're a good liar, but I know you, Chloe
Yeah
Yeah, they're here
Ella, too,
and the guy you sent to kill Dan
Chloe, I can explain
You know what, I don't believe a word you say
Was anything that happened between us real, any of it?
I did love you
I still love you
Life was a curse until I met you
Since then, I've done whatever it takes
to stay alive for you
All right, well, I want you to do something then
I want you to turn yourself in
It's not happening
Okay, we've got your guy here,
and he is gonna crack
He's not gonna say anything
He knows I can get to his sister
Chloe, you need to know
No, I want you to know
One way or another, Pierce, I am going to find you
I doubt that
It's okay It's okay
How are you feeling?
I'm fine
Maze, you need to rest
No, I can't stay here
Pierce is right
Being on Earth
around all these humans
all these emotions, makes me weak
You look like you fought ten people
and ran a mile to get here
12 people
Four miles
My point is
you did that for me
To save me
Emotions
emotions are hard
But that's why they make you strong
And this is
This is the strongest I've ever seen you
Linda, I'm
You don't have to say anything
Your actions speak plenty
Ah
That's the thing
Actions are easy for me
That's why I need to say it
I'm sorry
Me, too
But I got to ask
Is somebody really trying to kill me?
Don't worry
You're safe
Everything's gonna be fine
I miss Charlotte
So do I, Ms Lopez
I can't believe she's really gone
And that Pierce would do what he did
I know,
God works in mysterious ways,
and bad things happen for a reason
But this many bad things,
I just
I'm having a hard time finding any reason
Why would He do all this?
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I don't actually think
it's my Father's fault
See, all this time I thought it was Him
pulling the strings
I've started to realize that
we are the responsible parties
It's quite devious of Him, if you think about it
We've no one to blame but ourselves
Screw that
I blame Pierce
And, Big Guy?
You and I are on rocky ground
We know about your sister
Yeah? Then you know why I'm not talking
If you cooperate, we can protect her
You can protect her?
I'm tied to a chair in a penthouse
above a nightclub
You, him,
you can't protect anyone
Where's your safe house?
The walk-in closet?
That's what I thought
Chloe, can I have a second alone with him, please?
Can I leave you alone with him?
Okay
Oh, God, listen, save whatever threats you think
A corrupt cop
What?
A corrupt cop
That's what Pierce called me
when we first met
And it pissed me off when he said it
Well, you know what?
He was right
I have stolen evidence
I've had someone killed
And I never regretted it for a split second
So if you're wondering,
would I kill the guy who tried to murder me in my sleep?
With the gun
that killed the woman I love?
What do you think the answer is?
My s my sister,
Kelsey, she's
all I care about The only thing
So, if you can prove to me
that you can really and I mean really protect her
I'll tell you whatever you want to know
I just
I'll tell you whatever you want to know
His sister's address
Once we can prove she's safe,
he promised he'd give us everything we need
Okay, Lucifer and I will go get her
You guys, stay here, keep an eye on him
Right, the sister's loft should be right up here
All right
Detective
This is all my fault
What? No, no, no, you can't blame yourself for Pierce
No, you were right
You tried to warn me about him,
and I didn't listen to you
But although, who could believe anything you say?
Angels, demons, immortal men
Detective, I always tell you the truth
No
You tell me your truth
And I know
that all of these metaphors, they're real for you
But I think
I think humoring them
has just encouraged you, and that's on me, but I'm done
Detective
No more metaphors
No more "devil" talk
I've told you before,
you may think that that's what you are,
but I don't see you that way
Lately, I'm not sure I do, either
All right, well, first things first
- Right - Yeah
Come on
Okay
Hello?
Kelsey, are you here?
Your brother sent us
Are you sure?
- Okay All right, thanks - What's going on?
I called in a favor to Detroit PD
Had them run that dude's prints on the DL
Uh-huh And?
He's an only child
There is no sister
So that means that they're walking into a trap
Something doesn't feel right
I wouldn't do that, Chloe
You don't have to do this, Pierce
Yes, I do
And normally, I would just skip town and reinvent myself
But this time, I can't
Not before I kill Lucifer
What?
- Why? - Because I know
that he'll never stop hunting me
And I can't afford to spend
the rest of my days looking over my shoulder
But you don't have to die, Chloe
Step away from him
Detective, for once, I agree with this imbecile
Step aside
No
Detective
Chloe
I believed everything you said,
Marcus
That you loved me
That you did all of this for me
Which is why I know
that you won't shoot
You made me realize that life is worth living
And I will do anything to stay alive
And if you get in the way of that
Okay
I believe you
I don't want to die
I can't
Not without stopping you
No! No! Detective!
What? No, no, no, no, no, no
This this can't happen
This
Finish it Finish it!
No!
What happened?
You're safe
That's all that matters
We need to find Pierce
I guess it's just you and me now
Dan?
Hey, Chloe, uh, it's a trap
Dan, I-I know
I know
We had to find out the hard way
Pierce, he tried to kill us
What? Are you okay?
Yeah, I am Is she okay?
I-I don't know how,
but I am
Or maybe I do know
Maybe I've been avoiding the biggest truth this whole
I have to go
Chloe, don't go in there without backup
There's no point
The detective's a safe distance away now
Ah, that's good
I came prepared
As I recall
this can kill you pretty well
A fair fight it is, then, Cain
Someone's been working out
I promised you
that I would find a way to kill you
I am a Devil of my word
Is Chloe okay?
She's fine
No thanks to you
Now that I know I'm dying,
I don't know what I was so afraid of
I'm going to Heaven
You really believe that
I told you, Lucifer, I don't regret anything I've done
Yes, but that was before you killed Charlotte Richards
No
No, that was an accident
Well, you pulled the trigger
You ended her life
You chose to kill her
Oh
Deep down,
you know you're a monster
And that you belong in Hell,
where you will torture yourself with that truth for eternity
'Cause no matter what you tell yourself,
you can't outrun what you've done
What you truly are
And neither can you
Lucifer
Lucifer
It's all true
Detective?
It's all true

["Shine on Me" by Dan Auerbach playing]
CHLOE: Police! Stop!
[bystanders shouting]
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
[rapid gunfire]
MALE VOICE: Once upon a time,
there was a world,
just like ours, but with one small change
that changed everything
No!
Why the hell did you do that? Why'd you go after him?
Damn it, Bonnie You should've let him get away
[weakly]: Not on my watch
[chokes, coughs]
DIRECTOR: Cut!
WOMAN: Here you go, Chloe
DIRECTOR: Where's that stunt guy? Get him over here
Can I get a coffee?Damn it
Damn it We didn't get it, did we? Here
You okay?
Yeah, I just choked on the stupid blood capsule
Hey, nice work Thanks
Did all the squibs go off?
Yeah, it was sick You killed it
This sequence is gonna be amazing
You know, you're gonna win one of those stunt awards for this
Well, especially after you get the car chase
Not sure about that
What, are you worried about me?
All I got to do is get up to the top, do that burnout,
and then Debi's gonna take over
N-No, it's-it's not you I'm just kind of
not going to be here for it
Wait, what? Why?
I can't really talk about it here,
but trust me, it's a good thing
Actually, me and some friends are going out
to celebrate tonight Why don't you come?
I'll fill you in on everything
Well, I-- you may be off the hook, but I got to drive this
$6 million James Dean Porsche tomorrow
Come on
One drink
[sighs]
[drink being poured] 
Forgive me, Father 
for not offering you a drink 
I have an aversion to the cloth  Daddy issues 
Long story 
I understand, and I do apologize  for the intrusion, Mr Morningstar 
Please allow me to explain myself 
Excellent course of action 
You see, I'm not a normal priest 
[laughing] Was there ever such a thing? 
I mean I'm not a normal priest in the sense 
that I don't have my own congregation 
I am a 
I'm an investigator 
For the Vatican 
Vatican investigator? 
Sounds like a soon-to-be-canceled  TV show 
I assure you, it's a very real job 
I've spent the last 40 years traveling the globe in pursuit of the demonic 
I know the divine is real 
And I also know that evil walks the earth 
And that you, Mr Morningstar-- 
Oh, brother, here we go 
Are not it 
Not quite what I was expecting 
So if I'm not the devil, then why are you here? 
And what does any of this have to do with the Detective? 
Because Miss Decker believes that you are 
I see 
About a month ago, she came to Rome with a most outlandish tale 
The devil himself is hiding in plain sight, 
masquerading as a nightclub owner in Los Angeles, 
and that he'd revealed himself to her 
Well 
this is wonderful news 
Wonderful? How so? 
Well, as my therapist would say-- I know, so LA 
But she'd say that talking about your issues 
was the first step in dealing with them, 
so if the Detective did have issues with me 
sounds like they've been dealt with 
Now, if that's everything, Father, you can be on your merry way 
I just felt that it was my duty  to warn you 
Because the reason that she came to Rome was to, well 
send the devil back to hell 
[laughs] 
The Detective would never do that 
Chloe is a good person with a good heart 
Finally, something we can agree on 
But whatever she went through, whatever drove her to Rome 
it shook her to her very core 
She's the reason that I'm here 
You need to be careful, Mr Morningstar 
God knows what she has planned for you 
[humming quietly] 
[Ella] What are you so cheery about, Decker? 
What? 
-I'm not cheery -Wait, why aren't you cheery? 
I've been nursing a bad one all day 
Ha! What? Too much Romulan ale? 
Too much tequila 
I went a little nutso on all the margeritas yesterday 
Yesterday, Sunday Did you swap out the sacramental wine? 
I skipped church yesterday 
And the week before, you said 
Listen, Ella, I sort of wanted to check in with you, 
-to see-- -You know, it's just 
me and the big guy are on a bit of a break 
I completely understand  I mean, more than you'll ever know 
In fact 
recently 
I got clarity on a very similar issue 
And 
I think it's why I've been feeling so positive lately 
-[bang] -[man's voice] Enough! 
Stop calling me! 
Jeez 
Hang on 
Is everything okay? 
[phone buzzes] 
-Everything's fine -[phone buzzes] 
Well, are you going to answer that? 
Absolutely not 
Dan, it could be important 
Be my guest 
Okay 
Dan's phone 
[gurgling roar on phone] 
What the hell is that? 
I'll show you what that was 
Yeah 
That's my phone number 
Lucifer's been posting these all over the precinct 
It's not funny, Chloe 
I swear he only exists to 
torture me 
Look, I know you and Lucifer have had your issues lately, 
but maybe this is his way of-- 
Know what? I'm sick and tired of everybody making excuses for him 
I wish you could just see a little bit of what I see, Chloe 
He's 
he's a bad guy 
He's 
he's trying to be better 
He in his own way 
[Dan] Whatever 
[ambient pop playing in the background] 
Brother 
You look like I feel 
No, I'm pretty sure that my issues are much bigger than yours Trust me 
I think we all know nothing is bigger than mine 
-The strangest thing just happened-- -Linda's pregnant 
We'll call it a tie [chuckles] 
Are you sure it's yours? 
Lucy, Linda's not like that 
You of all people should know 
Relax, brother, I just meant 
a celestial impregnating a human-- 
How is it even possible? 
And, if it is, how has this not already happened to you? 
[Lucifer] True 
Mm 
Maybe there's another explanation 
You think Linda's an angel in disguise, don't you? 
I've been wondering the same thing Maybe she's not even human 
Or, maybe, when you lost your wings, you became as mortal as it gets 
Maybe you became more human than you realized 
Oh 
Probably makes more sense 
[Lucifer laughs] 
I bet you regret coming back now, eh, brother? 
Absolutely not Quite the opposite in fact 
Oh, come on, you don't have to sell me You can join the Navy for all I care 
Lucy, I am happy to be here 
Don't you see? I'm going to be a father 
Well, if you're so happy, then what are you doing hiding out in my bar? 
Because I have absolutely no idea what to do 
I mean 
where do I even begin? 
Wrong tree, I'm afraid 
But you are here on Earth, so, if it's any consolation, 
you couldn't do worse than our father 
-How do you know that? -Because ours was literally never there 
-Hey, where've you been? -What do you mean? 
Well, I sent you that text about rescheduling our date 
Oh, yes, right Definitely, no, I'd like that 
Okay, great Good 
Is everything okay? 
Yes, just feeling a little parched and my flask has apparently disappeared 
You know, I've been thinking 
Maybe it's best if you don't drink so much 
You know, at least while we're working 
Ah 
I see what this is about 
-You do? -Yes 
And you needn't worry, Detective 
Unbelievable as it may seem, being the actual devil does have its downsides 
I can't get drunk on normal, human amounts of alcohol 
I only drink because I like the taste 
Well, I'm but people don't know that [laughs] 
What do I care what other people think? 
I'm just saying showing people that you can change is-- 
Ah, here it is! 
[laughs] 
Wrong pocket 
Shall we? 
[camera shutter clicks] 
Hey, Ella Are you feeling better today? 
[Ella sighs] Well, better than this poor girl 
Susan Ochoa, 29 A bona fide rocket scientist at Brody Aerospace 
Neighbor saw the door open, body on the floor, called it in 
-I'm assuming that's the murder weapon -Yep 
A good old knife in the back 
Bit on the nose 
So no forced entry 
two glasses, 
someone brought flowers 
She knew her attacker 
It's always the ones you least suspect, the ones you trust the most, 
that hurt you 
[Ella] They wait until your guard is down and then wham! 
In my case, it was tequila 
Riveting 
Any witnesses? 
None, but the victim's friend might know more 
Oscar 
Do you know anyone who would have wanted to hurt Susan, Mr Rivas? 
No Everybody liked Susan 
Who did she trust the most? 
To be honest, I don't know much  about Susan's life here 
I just came from El Salvador She was supposed to pick me up from the airport 
When she didn't show, I came here and 
I saw all of this 
-And how do you know her? -[Oscar] We were in a gang 
Los Xs 
A gang member turned rocket scientist Gosh, and I thought I had range 
When I left the life, I wanted to pay it forward 
So I helped people like Susan get out and get clean 
She was a drug addict? 
Don't judge her A lot of us were 
Oh, I'm not judging I love drugs 
In fact, do you think she might have any lying around? [giggles] 
Do you know if Susan still had any connection to Los Xs? 
No, she made a clean break 
She moved here, went to school, made an amazing life for herself 
Promise me you will punish the son of a bitch that did this 
Oh 
with pleasure 
Okay Thank you, Mr Rivas We'll be in touch if we need anything 
You take him Let's get in touch with next of kin and head back to the precinct 
I meant what I said earlier 
What do you mean? 
That I don't care what people think about me 
So if you want to talk to anyone about, you know, me being the devil [laughs] 
That is if you haven't already, then, just know that it is totally fine with me 
Okay I don't think that's necessary 
Right So you haven't told anyone about me? 
No 
No, not a soul 
{\an8}[female] She's a monster 
{\an8}Demanding, complains all the time 
{\an8}It's like nothing is ever good enough 
{\an8}And how old is Brooklyn now? 
{\an8}Three You know, sometimes I catch her looking at me like she knows she's won 
{\an8}It can't be all bad 
{\an8}-Can it? -Don't you get it? 
{\an8}She's a sociopath 
{\an8}Children are all sociopaths 
{\an8}[door opens] 
{\an8}[Lucifer sighs] Time's up 
{\an8}Apologies, I've more pressing matters to discuss with the doctor 
{\an8}I'm in the middle of my session here 
{\an8}Well, the doctor is with child She needs her rest 
{\an8}How dare you burden her with your petty concerns, now? 
{\an8}Run along Come on, shoo! 
{\an8}-[patient squeaks] -Shoo 
{\an8}-[patient squeaks] -[door bangs] 
{\an8}So 
{\an8}I hear congratulations are in order 
{\an8}Some people claim to find the life-long burden fulfilling 
I'd rather not talk about the pregnancy at work, if you don't mind 
{\an8}Lips sealed So, about me 
{\an8}What do you do when someone has betrayed you? 
{\an8}Normally I'd go straight to punishment, fire, brimstone, 
{\an8}public humiliation via YouTube 
{\an8}But in this case, the subject happens to be none other 
{\an8}than the Detective 
Wait, Chloe? 
What did she do? 
{\an8}I caught her in a lie 
{\an8}A most heinous transgression 
Oh, and she may be plotting to send me back to hell 
{\an8}Okay, that's a very serious accusation 
-How do you know this? -A complete stranger told me 
Have you talked to Chloe about this? 
{\an8}Well, she's lied once What's to stop her from lying again? 
{\an8}I just need you to tell me how to deal with her 
{\an8}Cautiously, Lucifer 
{\an8}There may be a very reasonable explanation for Chloe's behavior 
Like a spouse who suspects their partner's been cheating, 
{\an8}an accusation of betrayal is a bell that can't be un-rung 
Translation, doctor? 
Feel her out a bit 
{\an8}Susan survived Los Xs and then made it as an engineer at Brody Aerospace 
I think I've got myself a new hero 
I find it pretty pathetic 
That's a little dark, don't you think? 
{\an8}I mean, it's great that a former criminal got clean 
{\an8}and figured out her life, but for what? 
Dan, it's about the journey, not the destination 
{\an8}[Dan laughs] She did all that work 
{\an8}turned her life around, just to get shot and killed for no reason at all 
You mean stabbed 
{\an8}Yeah, yeah I didn't-- 
{\an8}I know what you meant 
I really miss Charlotte too 
And, hey, if you ever 
{\an8}need to talk, seriously, or you just need a hug or 
{\an8}-Sometimes, there's comfort-- -No, no, don't, don't 
{\an8}Don't start, Ella, with the whole "it's all part of his grand plan, 
{\an8}mysterious ways" crap right now, okay, I just-- 
{\an8}I wasn't going to say any of that 
{\an8}I Honestly 
{\an8}I'm not sure if that's what I believe anymore 
{\an8}Right Could have fooled me 
{\an8}Fair enough 
{\an8}Look, I'm sorry, Ella, I didn't-- 
{\an8}No, no, you're right Practice what you preach 
{\an8}And right now 
{\an8}I'm not sure what I'm preaching 
{\an8}What's in the file? 
{\an8}Ah flowers found at the crime scene 
Bismarck hyacinths 
Rare, only found in five flower markets, 
one of which sold the bouquet the night of the murder 
Do we know who bought them? 
Well, receipts track to the credit card of tech genius-cum-billionaire, 
owner of Brody Aerospace, Anders Brody 
Susan Ochoa's boss 
-Erm, I'll tell Chloe -Okay 
A bit self-aggrandizing, don't you think? 
Maybe he's compensating for something 
Cue relentless onslaught of small penis jokes in three, two, one 
-You know, because he's compensating -For his guilt, I mean 
[Chloe] Well, I thought 
okay, well, never mind 
So you think that he's hosting charity regattas because he's feeling guilty? 
Yes 
For doing bad things, like betraying a beloved and totally innocent coworker 
You know,  maybe you and Anders are similar 
Rich, famous At the very least, notorious 
No, no, you're supposed to be Brody in this metaphor 
Have you ever considered donating any of your vast fortune to charity? 
[scoffs] 
I've put many a nubile law student through college, thank you very much, 
several of which were named Charity, so 
[Chloe] Ah, hard to believe  a guy so dedicated to saving the world 
would murder his own employee 
Well, sometimes betrayal come from the ones we expect the least, 
doesn't it, Detective? 
[Lucifer shouts] You! 
Anders Brody 
You killed her, didn't you? 
Killed? Who? 
-[bottle splashes] -Susan Ochoa 
You went round to her place and murdered her in cold blood 
[Anders scoffs] 
Are you out of your mind? Who are you? 
LAPD We're here investigating the murder of your employee Susan Ochoa 
Look 
I don't even know who that is, so 
-I certainly didn't kill her -[Chloe] What happened? 
You go over to her place, try and put the moves on her? 
She wasn't into it, you couldn't take it and killed her? 
I don't know her 
We know about the flowers 
They tracked back to you 
[Lucifer] Don't think so! 
[Chloe] Lucifer, what are you doing? 
-[rope whips] -[Anders groans] 
-[grunts] -[rope whips] 
-[engine starts] -[grunts] 
Susan invited you into her home 
[Anders groans] 
her life, and you betrayed her 
Do something! He's going to kill me! 
Lucifer, there may be a less violent way of getting him to talk 
Okay Alright, alright, alright 
I betrayed Susan 
[Anders gasps] 
But it's not what you think 
Please 
-[Lucifer] Fine -[snap] 
-[Anders gasps] -[thud] 
[Anders coughs] 
Thank you for your honesty I like honesty 
Now, if you wouldn't mind sharing with us 
a sympathetic and logical explanation for your betrayal 
Not another word without my lawyers 
[Anders pants] 
Is it true that human spawn erupt from their mothers' bodies 
in a ceremony of blood and pain? 
What? No 
[sighs] In hell 
torture via birth was a favorite 
If half of what we did is accurate 
your sex holes are never going back to normal 
Okay, Maze, erm 
That's enough, thank you 
And the birth is many, many 
many months from now 
[Maze] Yeah, but I have questions, Linda 
Things I don't want to know, things I need to know 
And there will be plenty of time to have all of your questions answered 
by someone else 
But it's just too soon to be dealing with all of this 
And, besides, I have a client that should be arriving any minute 
Whatever You're lying 
This is your lunch hour, 
where you eat your lunch and ogle hot guys on Tinder 
Of course, pretty soon, 
you'll be using this hour attached to one of those milking devices 
Oh-wah, oh-wah 
[laughs] We used to use those too 
In fact, we hooked this guy up to it once It was-- 
Okay, goodbye, Maze 
Okay 
[door clicks] 
[sighs] 
That must have been such a relief for him to come clean 
Who knows? Maybe next time we try to get him to confess in a less violent way 
Where's the fun in that? 
At the very least, next time maybe we 
try and get him to confess more specifically 
"I betrayed her,"  can mean a lot of things 
You're right You're right 
Maybe we should brainstorm a list of betrayals You start, Detective 
[phone rings] 
Oh 
Hey, Ella What's up? 
Anders Brody didn't kill Susan Ochoa 
[Chloe] <span style="style2">What? How do you know that?  
Because, while Brody's been in custody, the real killer just struck again 
[Ella] Victim's name is David Ramirez 
27, apprentice mechanic,  lived in the back of the shop 
-[Chloe] Is this what I think it is? -[Ella] Yep 
Tattoos that were removed and their designs look like 
[Dan] Los X's gang tats 
Apparently Ramirez grew up in foster homes, 
he got mixed up with the wrong crowd, got arrested a bunch of times, 
but, four years ago, 
he goes to night school, gets his mechanic certification 
and he's been clean ever since 
[slaps file] Damn it 
-What's wrong? -He's just 
[hits desk] 
Just trying to clean up his life, you know, like 
Susan Ochoa 
Okay, let's focus on the things we can control, 
like stopping the killer from striking again 
We know that all the victims were linked by their former gang, 
so maybe it's someone from their past But what's the motive? 
Retribution maybe 
Well, then let's talk to the former crew, see if anyone knows anything 
Los Xs aren't dumb corner boys anymore They're a major drug operation 
Which means they have lawyers, 
and without air-tight warrants or full SWAT backup 
they'll stonewall us 
You're absolutely right, so I'll call a judge, 
get a warrant  That might take a couple of days 
But Dan, I know what this is about, okay? 
There's nothing we can do until we get a warrant 
Okay 
Has anyone seen Lucifer? 
[door opens] 
[Lucifer] I'll take it from here 
-No, don't touch me! -I'll take it from here 
Relax, your neck is fine It's your guilt I want to get a grip on 
You said you betrayed Susan, so if you didn't kill her, what did you do? 
Look, I think it's best if you just speak with my-- 
You went to Susan's that evening for a reason, so tell me 
What did you desire? 
I wanted 
Mm? 
I wanted 
forgiveness 
Forgiveness? Why? 
One day I came upon Susan 
as she was talking to some at-risk youth group 
about her past, her struggles with addiction 
I had no idea and I panicked 
Imagine the PR crisis 
Head of Safety Protocols, a drug addict 
So I demoted her, took her off the NASA project 
You punished her for her former life 
But then I went through her file 
and I found that Susan was a model employee 
and she'd passed every single drug test, including the one last week 
-It wasn't right, what I did to her -So you went over to apologize 
But when I got there, it was too late 
[sighs] 
She was dead 
I was wrong 
Oh 
[Anders] Never said that before 
[Anders sighs] 
It feels good, man 
It feels real good 
I'm sure it does 
Anyway 
you're free to go 
Thanks 
Were you just hugging Anders Brody? 
Whatever it takes to get answers, Detective 
Huh! 
That's very evolved of you 
Mm 
Well, we're still waiting on warrants 
and we can't do anything on the case until tomorrow, 
so our night's free 
Go on 
Well, I thought that maybe we could meet up later 
And, er 
You know, not exactly a date, but 
maybe something better 
Well, it sounds like you have something very particular in mind 
See you next week  
Amenadiel 
What are you doing here? 
I brought you some things 
Stuff that could help you out during this time 
That's so nice of you, but I don't need anything 
Linda, listen, I want to be here for you, alright? 
So I figured that this would be a good way for us to start 
Now 
let's do this 
This one's good, because this Dr Spock 
he seems to know the most about babies 
This one shows the baby 
that all animals poop 
I'm not really sure why the baby would need to know that 
This one is good 
{\an8}because it tells you what to do when a baby is crying 
{\an8}Although maybe you don't need this one 
{\an8}I overheard at least three people crying in here today 
-and you handled it like a pro-- -It's too soon 
Honestly 
It's very kind of you and I appreciate the gesture, I really do 
but I 
I told you you were the father because you deserved to know 
Not to pressure you into helping out 
The truth is I'm used to doing things on my own 
I don't see why raising a baby should be any different 
I just wanted to help 
You don't need to worry about me 
And you, I 
I would love to talk, but, 
unfortunately, I have a ton of paperwork to do before my next client, so 
Right 
I'll get out of your way 
I like that one 
[Maze] Really? Not the one I would have chosen, 
but you are the closest person to a baby I know 
Okay, so at what age did your parents teach you to hunt? 
[Dan] What's going on? Maze, you know she's not allowed to play with knives 
Relax, Dan, these knives aren't for Trixie 
They're for a baby 
Okay, new rule 
No more knife play of any kind with my kid You got it? 
-Fine -Trixie, it's time to go 
Grab your stuff 
So who pissed in your Cheerios? 
You're even grumpier than usual 
It's the case, okay? I feel powerless 
Any second now, another person could get killed 
and we're just we're sitting on our asses 
-Why? -Because we've got to wait for a judge 
to give us a stupid warrant 
Says who? 
Mr Morningstar, thank you for reaching out 
Are you okay? 
Did Detective Decker Did she do something? 
No 
And she never will 
I'm just here to tell you that you're wrong about the Detective 
If she's planning anything, it's an apology 
I certainly hope that that's the case 
Oh, ye of little faith, Father 
Have you noticed her carrying a vial? 
A what? 
[Father] A vial It's a 
An ornate thing It's about the size of a plum 
I got word from a colleague of mine in Rome that she'd met with a priest 
who was hell-bent on banishing the devil from Earth 
And you all get paid to do this? I'm genuinely asking 
Supposedly, this priest has uncovered a ceremony that would, and bear with me 
trap the devil in hell for all eternity 
He shared the details of this ceremony with Chloe 
[giggles] 
A ceremony to banish the devil to hell? That is priceless Ha-ha! 
No, seriously, 
you all need to take <span style="style2">End of Days out of the Vatican movie night rotation 
Definitely not one of Arnold's best 
I know 
I know it sounds crazy 
But Chloe was very distressed last time I saw her 
Apparently, the ceremony involves giving the subject a sacramental liquid 
that would sedate the devil 
Ooh, let me guess 
It's inside the plum vial 
So I'm told 
And if it would sedate the devil, I fear that it involves some poison 
Something that would kill a normal man 
You're incorrigible, aren't you? 
Do you honestly think that I would travel thousands of miles, 
tell you these outlandish tales, if I didn't take them seriously? 
I hope beyond hope that I am wrong 
But if there is any chance that Chloe could try something, 
you need to be careful 
Well, consider me warned 
You may absolve yourself of any further responsibility in this matter 
Now, if you'll excuse me 
I have plans 
[door rattles] 
Is that the man? 
Not a man, Your Excellency 
The prophecy is real 
And now that the trap is set 
everything will come together soon 
I hope this so-called surprise of yours doesn't involve me taking off my shoes 
I should warn you that what I have planned 
might be painful for you, but 
I think, ultimately, you'll see it's a good thing 
Painful? 
Detective, what on Earth are you talking about? 
It's just up ahead 
What is?  
Just forgive me 
Detective 
where are you taking me? 
[banging on metal] 
[menacing rap playing in background] 
Howdy 
What's up, fellas? 
[door bangs shut] 
Do you have any idea where you are? 
Yes, I do 
Los Xs headquarters 
So-called brain trust of your transnational drug operation 
[Dan laughs] Come on, guys, relax 
That's not why I'm here, okay? 
Susan Ochoa and David Ramirez were murdered 
And I know you guys are involved somehow 
So I need to talk to the guy or the girl who's in charge 
And be quick about it I'm in a bit of a hurry 
[chuckles] 
Okay, you know what, maybe I didn't make myself clear 
Which one of you losers is in charge? 
Okay Alright 
I guess I'm just going to have to press the issue, right? 
-[clank] -[boom] 
-[Dan] Come on! -[someone whistles] 
You see now, that wasn't so hard, was it? 
[Dan] What's up? Can you please tell me everything you know about the murders? 
What if I don't? 
Well, then there's going to be a problem 
[laughs wheezily] 
Ah, you're a crazy pig, aren't you? <span style="style2">Respeto 
But the only problem we got 
is figuring out what we're going to do with your body 
Ssss! <span style="style2">Matalo! 
[gun cocks] 
[whistle] 
[crash] 
[groaning] 
What? What? 
[groaning] 
Cut it a little close there, don't you think? 
My timing is perfect 
[woman screams] 
[groaning] 
[metal door clangs] 
[men] Let's go 
What are we doing in a soup kitchen? 
Volunteering You should try it It could be fun 
Watching people trip and fall is fun This 
not fun 
Lucifer, I just thought it would be nice for us to do something good for a change 
Oh, for a change And just what exactly is it you'd like me to change? 
Oh, Lucifer, that's not what I meant 
Listen, okay, if you'd like to leave, we can leave 
You have been acting very strange, Detective 
Wanting me to drink less, be nicer to suspects, be more 
-[phone buzzes] -more philanthropic 
Oh, that's not true 
The only thing that's true is that you've been lying to me 
No, I haven't 
Show me your purse 
My purse? 
-Why? -Show it to me 
Okay 
Fine 
Detective, what's this? 
Nothing 
Oh, right Well, if it's nothing, you won't mind me drinking it, will you? 
-No, don't drink it It's perfume -I've had worse 
[Chloe yells] No, don't! 
I know you've been meeting with Father Kinley 
I know all about it 
-It's not what you think -Isn't it? 
-[phone buzzes] -No, it's not It's 
[Chloe gasps] 
Dan, can I call you back? I'm right in the middle of something 
[Dan] <span style="style2"> I know who the killer is 
[Chloe] <span style="style2">What? 
And he's about to skip town 
[phone buzzes] 
[Chloe] Hey, Dan 
[Dan] <span style="style2">Okay, his name is Oscar <span style="style2">and I just sent you a picture 
[Chloe] It's Susan Ochoa's drug counselor We talked to him at the scene 
Well, the head of Los Xs says that he's the killer 
The head of Los Xs? 
How? 
We caught a break, okay? It doesn't matter 
What matters is that Rivas was a gang counselor for both victims 
So you're saying they trusted him, 
made their dark sides vulnerable and then he just stabbed them in the back 
Yeah, pretty much 
Why? 
That's the million-dollar question 
[fast-paced music playing] 
[Chloe] Lucifer! 
Lucifer, wait! 
[crash] 
-Wait! -[door slams] 
[banging on door] 
-Let me in! -[metal creaking] 
[banging on door] 
[Lucifer, rasping] You! 
How could you just murder them? 
I did what needed to be done 
[bang] 
-[groans] -[crash] 
[Lucifer panting] They trusted you! 
They shared their darkest truths and you just betray them? 
[Oscar gasps] 
And I would happily do it again 
Oh, ho ho! This is going to be fun 
-[Lucifer roars] -[smashing of wood] 
I showed those losers the real me 
Careful, or I'll show you the real me 
Oh, yes Do it! 
I thought they could change 
But they couldn't 
Dave was stealing again 
Susan was back on drugs 
They were trash 
So I killed them 
[laughs] 
What are you going to do? 
-[bang] -[Oscar gasps] 
[Oscar laughs demonically] 
I'll show you 
Show me what you've got 
Come on, Lucifer 
Show us who you really are 
[thump] 
[Oscar panting] 
Do you want me to punish you? 
-Why? -[Chloe] Hands in the air 
I failed 
May God forgive me 
-[groans] -[splintering sound] 
[Dan] Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, man 
When you kneed that dude and he fell down and I just came in there, 
wham, elbow to the face, amazing 
It just felt so good, you know 
Just to let loose, not have to follow the rules for a change 
And you are amazing 
for helping me out like that 
Come on, any time you want to beat someone up 
Any time, you call me 
In fact, I'm going to kick your ass if you don't 
Oh, man, this is going to sound crazy 
But I can't wait to do it again 
Oh! Old Dan is back 
I am so in 
The straight and narrow Dan, total buzzkill 
Screw that Dan 
It was getting me nowhere 
Trust me, darker Dan 
will get you real far 
Well, that does it 
I'll never be able to eat beef kebabs ever again 
Did you find anything? 
[Ella] Yeah, same thing Bloody clothes, another knife, same as the others 
And who owns the house? 
I don't know,  I'll see if we have that yet Man 
this dude must have been really  scared of something to go out like that 
[Chloe] Mm Or someone 
Are you okay? 
Something else was happening here 
Something strange 
He knew about my true face He wanted me to show it to him 
-Why? -I don't know 
But I could have sworn that he said, "Show us your face" 
[Chloe] Us? 
But there was no-one else here 
Unless it's a two-way mirror 
[splintering of glass] 
[Ella] Erm, that was evidence This is a secure crime scene 
Never mind 
You're never going to believe who owns the house 
The Catholic Church 
Your friend Father Kinley must have been watching 
I think Kinley arranged all of this to get to you 
He wanted to show someone who 
or what 
you really are 
I know that we have a lot to talk about and I have a lot to explain 
and I know a lot of this is my fault, but you need to trust me right now 
Oh! Really? 
-I think you're in real danger -Enlighten me, Detective 
Just who exactly am I in danger from? 
What in God's name was that? 
It was a setback, that's all 
That man killed two people, then himself, and you knew? 
No, wait You orchestrated it 
Extreme measures were taken 
It would have been worth it if Lucifer had shown his true face 
Can you even hear yourself? 
The Church needs to see that Lucifer Morningstar is the actual devil 
[distant footsteps] 
It should have worked 
Chloe told me that he likes to make every case about himself 
and I set it up perfectly for him to want to punish Rivas 
How could he not reveal himself? 
[Chloe] Because he's better than you give him credit for 
[laughs] 
Detective Decker 
Well, she knows the truth Tell him 
I do know the truth, Father 
You worked at the same parish in El Salvador as Oscar Rivas 
It's quite the coincidence 
Oscar was a good man, a true believer, willing to do what was necessary 
To take what action was needed to battle evil 
You had Rivas kill two innocent people to battle evil? 
He willingly sacrificed himself 
to force Lucifer to reveal his true form, to show the Church finally the truth 
[Father scoffs] 
This is all your own private crusade, isn't it, Father? 
The Vatican doesn't know about this, do they? 
[laughs] 
Because they don't believe 
But, together, you and I can convince them 
Together, we can save them 
And so many others 
[clink of handcuffs] 
You're under arrest, Father 
For conspiracy to commit murder 
Dear, dear girl 
Oscar is dead and I have done nothing wrong myself 
You have no proof 
It's your word against mine 
-[handcuffs clink] -There is always evidence 
I will find it and I won't stop until there's enough to put you away 
[Vicar] That won't be necessary 
I'll testify Anything you need 
I'm sorry, but you're sick, Will 
[female voice] Mrs Smith 
I'm looking for Mrs Smith 
Amenadiel 
What are you doing here? 
Linda, you don't have to do this alone 
I want to be here for this baby and, most importantly, I want to be here for you 
Erm 
Yeah 
[Linda] Oh 
Will you marry me? 
[surprised giggles] 
[laughs] 
[Linda inhales, whispers] No 
[woman gasps in background] 
[quietly] No 
No Amenadiel 
Amenadiel, come here 
See 
Amenadiel 
What you're doing is amazing and heroic and I should be so lucky 
to end up with someone half as special as you are 
But what you're doing here, it's 
It's for the wrong reasons 
And it's 
It's not what I 
It's not what I need right now 
And what do you need? 
I think I just need someone to hold my hand 
and tell me everything's going to be okay 
I promise you, Linda 
everything is going to be okay 
[sighs] 
[bell rings] 
Hi 
I arrested Father Kinley, 
so you don't have to worry about him coming after you anymore 
I don't care that he was trying to hurt me 
I care that you were 
[sighs] 
Lucifer, you have to understand that 
after I saw you 
saw your face 
I had to get away 
to process things 
you know? 
And somehow I ended up in Rome 
Kinley found me 
and obviously I shouldn't have confided in him, but 
[sighs] you know, at the time 
it felt like he understood what I was going through 
-He said you found him -He's lying 
There's a lot of that going around 
Well, yes 
I 
[voice wavers] I did lie to you 
and for a moment, I was helping him  try to send you back to hell 
[scoffs] 
How could you do that to me? To me? 
[screaming] Because I'm terrified! 
[gasps] 
You are the 
actual devil 
I mean 
every story of good and bad from throughout history, throughout time, 
says that you are the embodiment of evil 
[Chloe gasps, sobbing] 
And how am I, Chloe Decker, a nobody 
supposed to deal with that? 
But 
But then 
Then I came back 
And 
[sighs] 
And I saw you 
I really saw you 
And I remembered how you made me feel 
And I realized, Lucifer, you're not that guy 
No 
What if I am that guy? 
You don't have to be You could change 
But what if I can't? 
[gasps] 
Could you accept me like this? 
I oh 
You have no idea how much I want to 
I do I'm 
I'm trying 
But could you? 
[sniffs, stammers, sobs] 
I don't know 
[sniffs] 
Then I have my answer 
[gasps] 
[inaudible] 
Your Excellency 
Did you change your mind? Are you here to get me out? 
I am here to take your confession 
I have nothing to confess 
William, you are responsible for the deaths of three people For what? 
I'm trying to save lives 
To stop the prophecy 
When the devil walks the earth and finds his first love, evil shall be released 
Enough with this damned prophecy you're obsessed with 
The devil is walking the earth 
His Holiness has issued an order 
You've been excommunicated 
I 
may have failed, temporarily, to prove that Lucifer is the devil, 
but at least I have pushed him and Chloe Decker apart 
Maybe that will be enough to stop the prophecy 
Even if Lucifer Morningstar was the devil 
and the prophecy was true 
what makes you so sure Chloe Decker is even his first love? 
I'll be praying for you, William 
[door buzzes] 
Of course she is 
Who else could it be? 
["Glory Box" by Portishead playing in background]

So many options

- Hey, Chlo - Hey
No Lucifer tonight?
No Actually, he and I aren't working together anymore
- What? For real? - Yep
What happened?
You know, I don't really want to talk about it
Okay
You're okay though, right?
Totally Totally fine
You know, I was fine before Lucifer, I'll be fine after
It's really for the best
Alright No arguments from me
What do we have here?
Pablo Silva,
hotshot jewelry designer from Beverly Hills,
- just back from the Middle East - Cause of death, pretty obvi
Manual strangulation
Not a fun way to go
Unless it's your thing
Ella found pistachio shells under the body
So weird, because there's no pistachios anywhere on the plane
But the cabin's full of other great stuff
Shrooms, weed, coke
Might want to keep Lucifer away from the evidence
if you don't want any to go missing
Wait a second Where is Lucifer?
He was decapitated?
No
He's not going to be working with us anymore
- What? - Let's just focus on the case, okay?
Who found the body?
Uh, over there
Toby Golden? You co-owned Golden Silva Jewelers with Pablo?
Yeah, we built it together, ground up
Pablo handles creative, I handle business
Have you found the necklace?
- Not yet - What necklace?
Pablo was transporting our latest piece, The Desert Mirage
It's a $3 million original he finished in Dubai
Why Dubai?
It's where we get our best deals, buying gold and diamonds
And you were here to pick him up?
No My assistant and I were prepping for an investors' meeting
and I didn't hear his voicemail until after we were finished
I come racing down here and
You know, I find him like this
Can we hear that voicemail?
Hey, Toby It's Pablo
I messed up, man I'm in some serious debt with these dangerous dudes
and I kind of promised to give them the Mirage
They're on their way over for it, but it's gone
Someone must have
Oh, no They're already here
Arabic
Do you know who Pablo was referring to there?
I didn't even know he was in any kind of trouble until this
Well, do you know anyone who speaks Arabic?
A lot of our business associates
Really? Great Okay, we'll need a list of those people
Maybe Pablo's dangerous dudes killed
him because he didn't get their payment
Wait, pistachios
There's a thug that I heard of, eats those things obsessively
The dude definitely qualifies as dangerous
And guess what his first language is?
Please say Arabic
Yep A guy named Turkish Pete
- But Arabic isn't Turkish - And Turkish Pete isn't Turkish
He's the right-hand man for an Arab criminal concierge
by the name of Bashir Al-Fassad
It could be them I'll take a look, make some phone calls
- Great - Alright
You Lucifer
Spill
- Oh, everything's fine - Nuh-uh
You don't get to do that Come on, my sister sense is tingling
Come on
Lucifer and I had a bad fight
It's okay Fights are totally normal
No, not this one
He and I have some pretty serious issues
that I don't think can be resolved
How is Lucifer handling it?
Well, I don't really know, but it's Lucifer,
so I'm sure he is just fine
Yeah Sure
Excuse me
[coughs] 
Bollocks 
[coughs] 
[Chloe] This is the answer 
This is the answer 
["Shake Shake" by Nessi playing] 
["Cradle" by DOE playing] 
I never felt like that before
That was
Exhilarating
That man was so terrible
Truly evil
We made him pay
Please
Who can we punish next?
I want to feel like that again
Yes, it's quite the rush, finally being who I'm meant to be
But, sadly, my dear, criminals don't line up to be punished
So that's why you work with the LAPD
It all makes so much sense now
You use them to find the bad guys
Well, I want in
Ah!
- Do you now, darling? - Mm-hmm
Maybe we could do it together
Find the worst of the worst and give them what they deserve
So, Julian, you admit to
human trafficking and to the murder of Gary Van Blunt
and officer John Reyes
Yes
You're going to jail for a really long time, cop killer
- At least I'll be safe there - What?
If you didn't break your back falling down a hill,
we need to know about that now
I fell down the hill
I f fell down the hill, I sw I swear!
Chloe
What's up?
Julian's reaction
Does it look familiar to you?
- Huh? - Like people we've seen before
after a certain consultant has been left alone with them
What do you mean?
- I think Lucifer did this - That's crazy
You know what's crazy? How much Lucifer gets away with
I'm sick of it Aren't you?
Lucifer wouldn't do this He wouldn't go this far
He would never take justice into his own hands?
Especially as a cop was killed because of his stupid recklessness
You need to cut him some slack
You have had a target on his back ever since
well
Charlotte
I'm just not sure if you're looking at this objectively
That's all
Like you are?
I could understand Lucifer callously ignoring our duty
to keep humans and the divine separate
But you?
How could you do this?
A child
with a human?
Wonderful human
I know how difficult this must be for you All right?
I used to be just like you
Looking down on humans as if they were ants
But we need to realize that we are not above them
I am above them
But you
You don't even have your powers anymore, do you?
No, I can no longer slow time and I'm glad
My powers, they kept me at a distance,
kept me disconnected from humanity
And I think that's why they're gone now
Because I don't want that anymore
You were the one who taught me
that celestials and humans need to be separate
Yes, Remy, I did, and now I am telling you
that I was wrong
Let me show you
Hey, Ella, who do we have?
Hey, Chloe
Victim died from a gunshot straight to the head up on that bridge
But apparently murdering wasn't enough
So they tossed his body over the bridge like day-old garbage
Broke nearly every bone in his body from the looks of it
Hmm
Are you okay?
Just death People die
Mm-hmm
Well, we just deal with it
Anyhow, what do we know about this guy?
Sam Zofrelli
Rap sheet filled with drug possession charges
Oh! We also found traces of cocaine
in his pockets, but no sign of drug use
So I'm thinking probably dealer
- So you think this was about drugs? - Maybe Pockets were empty
Keys, wallet, all gone
But the body was here for hours
so could have been taken by anyone brave enough
to frisk a corpse this effed-up
But why throw a body over a bridge
that's already dead?
Where's Lucifer?
Oh, he's been ignoring me actually
Oh, he's with Eve
Yes, probably with Eve What you think of her?
I think that she's rubbing off on him and not necessarily in a good way
Good morning, Detective
Please don't tell me she's behind me
She's behind you
Hello
Lucifer
This is a crime scene No visitors No offense, Eve
Eve wants the same thing we do
- Catch a killer - Yes
I am here to learn from you, Chloe
I want to know everything there is to know about catching criminals
Especially the very, very bad ones
Can I talk to you, alone?
Of course
This isn't gonna work
I agree A gingham pocket square can
be a bit aggressive, but I'm feeling it
- No Eve being here, not OK - Why not?
You can't just join a case for the fun of it
We are solving a murder This is serious
Oh, I agree Very serious
If that's how you feel, I completely understand
Where are you going?
If you don't want us here, we'll find the killer on our own
You can't do that
Oh, yes we can
Okay, fine
Fine Eve can ride along just for this case
Exciting!
This is going to be so much fun
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -  <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> 
Lucifer, this guy looks really guilty
What about this guy?
That's one mean looking face
- We should punish them - One criminal at a time, dear
Decker
No, I will not accept his call
Who was that?
Nobody
Ah-ah-ah!
Lucifer's bringing his girlfriend on cases now, huh?
She's actually really sweet
Anyway, you know what?
Why not do whatever makes you happy?
Because any second, bam! You can get hit
by a chunk of blue ice from an airplane
or get blown up into a million pieces by some crazed killer
Or you could mysteriously break your spinal cord
and become, you know, paralyzed
Yeah
Is anybody investigating what happened to Julian McCaffrey?
Nobody's buying his "I fell down the hill" story, right?
He didn't file any charges, so there's nothing to investigate
Even if we wanted to,
remember that house he lived in? It's probably been professionally cleaned
You're right
You're absolutely right
Oh, that's Daniel
He's a douche again
Oh, shall we punish him too?
Believe me, his existence is punishment enough
Hey, Ella What do we have?
Well, we still don't know why Sam's body was tossed off the bridge
Because the killer is a maniacal monster who needs to be taken down
Er maybe
But I did discover that the killer
pistol-whipped poor Sam before he died
- Sounds like it could be personal - And aggressive
And cruel
And a mistake, because I was able to recover something
from the gun marks on his face
Gold flakes
- Gold flakes? - Mm-hmm
In there? That's amazing
Ah! Well, you know, I'm just doing my job
Do you get to be there for the punishment too?
Er, no
Golden gun
It's unique and it sounds familiar
Yes, Roger Moore's Bond films
Perhaps our killer's Scaramanga, the man with three nipples
Maybe
Ella, do you remember there was a hitman
or something who carries a golden pistol Do you remember that?
Ah, let me see
Er ooh, right here
Greg Grabowski
and goes by the nickname "Pony Boy"
Pony Boy? Stay gold indeed
And you're never able to pin him down because he's so good
But if this wasn't a hit and it was personal,
it would explain why he was so sloppy
He sounds terrible
- Let's go punish him! - You mean, bring him to justice
That's what I said
Oh! That clears that up Come on
When I was a newborn demon
I was smaller than my opponents
But I was fast
So I used my speed, kept low
and always went for the major arteries
With my first vanquished foe on his knees,
I slit my blade across his throat
I felt the heat from his blood dripping down my face
And then a stranger heat in my loins
Okay
When I mentioned that the baby could hear
everything from inside the womb
I imagined introducing him to things like
classical music
and stories
that aren't about graphic murders
Why would you want to hear a story not about graphic murder?
We can talk about that later
- I have to go to work - Great
Give me a second to get my knives
Maze, sweetie
You can't come to work with me
I have to!
Do you know all the things that could
happen to you or your baby out there?
Er heartburn?
You could get gunned down in a drive-by shooting, Linda
Or kidnapped by a cartel who use women as drug mules,
not to mention what an angel baby will fetch on the black market
How comforting
You said I'm part of this family, Linda
So I'm going to protect you
Maze, the people I am seeing this afternoon
are a vegan chef who compulsively shoplifts
and a record producer who wets the bed
- But I - Maze
I don't need protecting
What you doing?
Oh, hey Er
I paid off the cleaning crew in Julian's house
What? I'm looking for something in his trash to prove
that somebody was there the night he was paralyzed
Well, I don't know about any of that, but I can help if you want
Lucifer's brand
What did you say?
Er, nothing
I, uh,
found what I needed
Oh, er Don't worry about me, Dan I can clean up
Damn, these guys are huge
We can take them, right, honey?
Of course I can, darling, I'm the Devil
In that case, I hope this guy we're after
is the biggest, meanest one there is
We don't want that
I do
Makes it more satisfying when Lucifer beats them up
We don't beat people up in the middle of the street
Oh Do we take them back to Lucifer's penthouse?
Anyway We don't beat people up anywhere
Unless they resist and then it's Devil by TKO
Don't worry, they always resist
There's Pony Boy
Look at those arms
Let's not get carried away
Greg "Pony Boy" Grabowski, LAPD You're under arrest
- for the murder - Okay
- What? - What?
What was that? I thought they always resisted
Look I've been through this a hundred times
I'm just gonna wait for my lawyer
Lucifer, you should torture the truth
out of him until his lawyer shows up
Eve, that's not how this works
Everybody calm down Eve just wants to see the devil do his thing
And there is one thing you haven't seen me do
Tell me
My little Pony Boy,
what is it you desire?
I
I wish
I wish
wish my boss had let me kill Sam
- Oh - Hmm
Sorry, darling, we can't punish him after all
The man's innocent
Are you crazy?
Watching the devil do this thing is so
hot
So you wished your boss let you kill him
Then who's your boss and if it wasn't you,
who used your golden gun to do it?
Lawyer Now
I mean
Turn around
It's fun, isn't it?
Hey, Chloe
I know that look
You found something
I hope so
Hitmen are often paid as corporate employees
through shell companies to hide the money
But it also sometimes means that they get the corporate perks
Like covering their gym membership fees
So who's paying for Pony Boy to get so jacked?
It looks like it all tracks back to Jacob Tiernan here
That paralyzed dude's dad?
Does this have something to do with that case?
Tiernan's son shows up paralyzed from the chest down
Then this guy dies So it has to be, right?
I think Sam's bones were broken before he was killed
in the exact same spot that Julian's was
Julian McCaffrey?
- Yeah - What does this have to do with him?
Maybe Tiernan thought that Sam broke Julian's back
Normally he'd hire Pony Boy to do his dirty work,
- but it's his son so - He wanted to enact revenge himself
and borrowed Pony Boy's gun to do it
- Yes - I'll get you the ME report
Great
Hey Luce
I did that
I broke Julian's back Tiernan killed an innocent man
What does that mean?
It means, my dear, that now more than ever
that monster needs to be punished
Mr Tiernan, I don't know if you heard
but a drug dealer was killed this morning
What does that have to do with me?
Well, that's the interesting part
He had the exact same spinal injury as your son
So it would seem that possibly someone is out for revenge
My son worked with a lot of bad people
In fact, Julian wasn't exactly a good person himself,
which is why I had to excise him from my business
You you love your children, but at a certain point
- you have to let them - Stand on their own two legs
Mr Tiernan, do you know a man named Greg Grabowski?
Goes by the colorful moniker "Pony Boy"
No
Hmm That's odd,
because one of your companies pays his bills
I have a lot of companies paying a lot of people a lot of money
I don't keep track of every penny
You kept track of your son, though, didn't you?
Which is why you consistently bailed him out of jail
Always getting him out of trouble
He never learned, did he?
In fact, some might say it's your fault
he became a killer, a human trafficker
A broken little doll
My son had a lot of friends
Maybe one of them decided to make
the piece of garbage who crippled him pay
Really?
Because I had a little chat with Julian
right before he shot a police officer in cold blood
He said that you were an even worse person than he was
Mm That must make you a true monster
Unless you have actual cause to charge me with something,
this little chat is over
Oh, I'm the devil, Tiernan,
I have all the cause I need
Detective, I think it's time you left
so I can do what I do best and punish this man
Get out
Lucifer He will be punished
Lucifer Lucifer, stop
Lucifer, do it
Get out!
Detective
leave
Stop
This isn't over
Tiernan killed Sam, but we have no proof
So?
So Tiernan's gonna double his legal defense
now that you've hulked out in his office
Devil is as devil does
What about this other guy? Uh, Pony Boy
Pony Boy already posted bail
Or Tiernan posted it for him
You're saying that we don't get to punish anybody?
Honey you promised
Can we give us a moment Thanks
What the hell is up with you?
I finally figured out who I am, that's all
Lucifer, this is not who you are
I think Eve is a bad influence on you
This has nothing to do with her
It's who I am, I punish people
So do I, but like I said, there is a right way and there is a wrong way
What makes you the authority on right and wrong?
I'm a cop and it's the law
Well, I'm the devil
I ruled Hell
Bad people were sent to me so they could get what they deserved
It is my job to do the same here on Earth because when I don't
When I don't, bad things happen
That is why I broke Julian's back
And that is why I won't let Tiernan get away with it
You broke Julian's back
What am I supposed to do with that, Lucifer?
It's not your place to do anything about it
Then why?
Why ask me to leave when we were in Tiernan's office?
You were going to hurt him and you wanted me to leave
because you knew it was wrong
No Because you've made it plainly clear
that you can't handle who I am
Mr Tiernan, the cops are back
- I have nothing more to say - I'm here about your son
Thank you, Margaret
He didn't just fall down that hill
Someone deliberately broke his back
And I know who it was
Why haven't you arrested this man?
I don't have enough proof to put him in jail
but he needs to be accountable for his actions,
and I know you're a powerful man
a man who ruins his enemies
I'm listening
Look
You could finally give him a taste of the punishment he deserves
What is this man's name?
Lucifer Morningstar
Since we know the murder was personal,
I looked back over the autopsy report
and I was hoping we could find spit or urine or something
we could use to track DNA
It's amazing how many dudes do that
I really don't get why
Do you get why?
Anyway, no luck there,
but I did notice that one of his fingers was broken
Still post-mortem, but not from the fall
It looks like someone broke his finger to pry a ring off
Probably whoever stole all his money and drugs
Mm Mm-hmm Yeah
Er, you okay?
Do you think there is such a thing as celestial justice?
Because if celestial justice does exist,
like heaven and hell,
then what we've been doing here, say arresting criminals
why even bother?
I know you're religious and I thought you may have some thoughts on it
Well, I was religious
- and - Oh
when I used to believe in all that stuff,
I really thought that I was doing my part
to uphold right and wrong on Earth
and everyone would get their comeuppance eventually,
but we still needed to keep people safe
But now I believe we are all anybody's got
and if we don't hold people accountable, nobody will
because heaven and hell, they don't exist
But what if they do exist?
- Say, the devil - He's not real
Chloe, look at the Bible
It is so full of contradictions
Fine Take the devil, for example
The devil's supposed to be pure evil, right?
But he started out as an angel
You can't start good and the turn all evil
I mean, that's what they want us to believe?
You're right
He's an angel
No, my point is that it's all bullshit
I
This is where I came with the mother of my child
right after we found out that we were going to be parents
We both realized
just how wonderful it would be
All I see is weakness
They're pathetic
If you raise your son surrounded by them, he will become like they are
They may be flawed, yes, but so are we
and flawed doesn't mean weak
Sounds like something a weak person would say
Amenadiel, I just want the best for your child
So do I
I'm taking the baby
No, Remy, you're not
I'll never let you find him or his mother
Too late
I picked up the scent this morning
I've listened to you out of respect, Amenadiel,
for what you once were
But I'm convinced more than ever of what I need to do
Remy
I won't let you take my child
Try and stop me
Oh, my Maze!
What is it?
I thought someone was following me
- Who? - You You are following me
Why are you following me?
I'm protecting you when you leave the house
Don't you have anything else to do?
Like hunting bounty
I cleared my entire schedule
I am never leaving your side
I don't need you to always be around
I need you to back off
But
how else am I supposed to protect our baby?
Our?
Maze, this isn't
I just need some space Okay?
Sure Since we're here, do you want to grab a coconut water?
I will never let you anywhere near Linda or my son!
Who's gonna stop me? You?
There's only one way to find out
Can't have anyone saying it wasn't a fair fight
I'm not going to let you raise this baby here,
where everything special about him will be leached away
He will be special because he's raised here!
With his family
Funny, I thought I was your family
You are my family, Remy
But this is my son!
Earth hasn't made me weak, Remy
It's made me stronger
A true warrior admits their defeat
So you'll respect my wishes?
I will reluctantly
But be careful, brother
I still fear one day
you'll come to regret your decision
Hey, Linda
So I'm just calling because I'm a little worried
about Lucifer, and thought that you might know
what's going on with him When you get a chance, call me back Thanks
What's wrong with Lucifer?
Is he okay?
Yeah, Lucifer's okay
I think he's just
He's just going through something right now
Don't you always say that when somebody's going through something,
that's when they need their friends the most?
You know what? You're right, monkey
But
I'm just not sure that I'm the friend that Lucifer needs right now
You do your homework
Could tie Tiernan to the anchor of one of his ships
- Mm-hmm - Or a million paper cuts
from his own hundred-dollar bills
Great
Oh, no, actually
I know a man who owns an emu farm
They're surprisingly bloodthirsty animals
Just pick a punishment and let's go What's the hold-up?
All in good time, my darling
You know how satisfying delayed gratification is in bed, right?
I think you're stalling
What?
Because of Chloe
Look
I like Chloe
I do, she's great
But to be honest
I think she's a bad influence on you
Oh
This has nothing to do with the detective
It's just better when you punish them properly
Lucifer
I just want you to be the best version of yourself
You know?
That devil I met in the garden
I held myself back for so long and I can see you doing the same
because of her
I just think she might be a little too involved in your life
That is preposterous
Hi, Lucifer
Who's this?
That is the detective's offspring
You have a piano up here?
Yes, but no! Please!
Please don't touch that I don't know where you've been
Look at all those books!
Yes, emphasis on the look
Whoa, a pony
Be careful with that, that was a gift from Napoleon
- Do you have a pet? - Yeah No, not really
You have stairs to get to your bedroom
Like a princess
Like a what?
How dare you?
You have a hot tub on your balcony?
No! Please don't jump on that, it's Italian
This is the coolest place ever!
Does your mother know you're
Does your mother know you're here?
Yes?
Well, what are you doing here?
I came here to make sure you're okay
My mom said you needed a friend
But it looks like you already have one
Hi
I'm Eve
Hey Trixie ready?
Trix, Dad's here
How's the case going?
We know who the killer is but
we don't have proof
Who is it?
Er, Julian's dad, Jacob Tiernan
Jacob Tiernan
What, he killed somebody?
He thought that Sam was the one who broke Julian's back, so
- Simple revenge motive - You're sure about that?
I mean, I didn't think he was capable of
- of that - Trix
Trix?
Come on
Dan
Dan!
Yeah?
- Trixie snuck out and went to Lucifer's - What?
Well
We've got to go find her
Now
Where do you live?
Here
- Where are you from? - Far away I came here for Lucifer
Keep the commentary to yourself, lady
- Have you ever been married? - Yes, it didn't work out
- How come? - We weren't right for each other
- What do you do for work? - I don't
Pretty much just get to be me
Well, that's kind of cool
- Favorite color? - Red What's yours?
I'm asking the questions
Would you excuse me whilst I do something less mind-numbingly boring
like color-sort my suits?
Are you the kind of friend Lucifer needs right now?
I hope so
I care about him very much
Oh, my Lucifer!
I didn't think there'd be anyone else here, but
can't have any witnesses
Oh, please
Let's go! Let's go!
What are you?
Tiernan sent you, didn't he?
Yeah
Where is she?
Where's Trixie?
She's safe She's through there
Mommy! Daddy!
Sorry
Monkey, you're okay
You're okay
I love you, honey
I hope you know I would
I would do anything to protect that little urchin
I know
I also know what you're thinking of doing to Tiernan
Especially now
And you, detective
Don't you want to punish him? He almost killed your child
Yes
I do, yeah
But I'm gonna do it by following the rules
because
I believe in right and wrong and
and deep down I think that
you do too
You're the devil
But you're also an angel
I'm not sure that I am an angel anymore
What do you mean?
After I killed Pierce when my devil face returned
I never checked to see if my wings were still there
I still haven't
Afraid that they're gone
For good reason
Well, you know
I think you should look
Maybe you'll be surprised at what you find
The police are done
Thank you
Thank you for Trixie
You're welcome
We're going to get this guy, right?
I mean
we've been looking for the worst of the worst
Here it is
You're right
It's time for Tiernan to get what he deserves, but
I need to do this on my own
It's important to me
Okay
You know, I
I only want us
you
to be happy
We have you dead to rights on attempted murder
So if you don't help us take down who really killed Sam Zofrelli
Well It was your golden gun used on the murder
so you might be looking pretty damn good for that, too
Look, I love Julian
That's why I wanted to be the one to kill Sam
But Julian's an idiot
He gets into trouble all the time
owed Sam a bunch of money
Is that why Tiernan thought Sam was the one to break Julian's spine?
Tiernan wouldn't give Julian any money to pay back Sam
So Julian had to give Sam whatever he could,
his car, his watch,
family heirlooms
Family heirlooms?
Yeah
It pissed Tiernan off, but he still loved the kid
He's his son after all
But even after all that,
Julian still couldn't come up with enough to pay back Sam
Right, so after Julian's spine was broken
Tiernan thought Sam must have been the one who did it
asked for the gun and then got revenge himself?
Too bad somebody else crippled Julian
What do you mean?
Tiernan found out Lucifer did it
That's why he sent me to kill him
We thought that Tiernan was upset because
of Lucifer's behavior in the office
Where did he get the idea that
Lucifer was the one to break his back?
No idea
All right You said family heirlooms, right?
Would that also include a family ring?
All right
Have you heard from Pony Boy?
Not yet
It's time to get to the jet
Leave town for a while
What the hell was that?
Hello again, Tiernan
I told you this wasn't over
Finally
It's time for you to receive the punishment that you deserve
What about that ring?
No, the ring that Tiernan had on had a family crest on it
Do you guys really think he would wear
it after taking it off a dead body?
It was a family ring,
so I t think Tiernan saw it as something that was taken from him
So if we can prove that Sam had the
ring on his finger before he was killed
and that it's now on Tiernan's hand, we can arrest him
Before anyone else gets to him
I think I've found it
Yes, that's it
- Taken before the night he was killed - Let's go get him
Flanders
I believe you're looking for this man
I happened to be walking past Tiernan's office,
and I overheard him talking about leaving town
As a concerned citizen, I felt it was my civic duty to bring him in
so he can properly face the punishment he deserves
Why did you do it?
Something made me realize I might have gone a bit too far recently
Hopefully it's not too late
You looked
You looked, didn't you?
At your wings
I did
You did the right thing, Lucifer
It's never too late for that
Maze?
Maze?
What are you doing?
Giving you your space
I know your heart's in the right place
and it makes me happy knowing
my son's Auntie Maze is in his corner
but I have to ask
Are you in love with me?
What?
I mean
you do have that good things come in small packages vibe about you
But, no, we're just friends
That's what I thought!
You know, Maze, I think you're looking for something more
than what this baby or I can be
I think you're looking for your own connection
For a partner
Hey
Oh, hey
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you
Oh, no, it's fine
Working pretty late tonight
Oh, yeah, I was just
wrapping up
Hey, Ella, do you
do you ever feel just completely
Lost?
Yeah
You want to talk about it?
No
No, honestly, not really
- You want to talk about it? - No
But I just don't know
what to do, you know
Well, I don't recommend a downward spiral into drugs and alcohol
Tried that, did not help
Detective Decker
Thank you for coming
I only came to tell you to stop putting in requests to speak to me
We have nothing to talk about
I'm sorry I don't have much time
They're going to transfer me back to Rome
to be tried there
Oh
I can't say I'm sad to see you go
There's something you need to know
No, there is something you need to know
You were wrong about Lucifer
He is a good man
One might say that he's even an angel
Lucifer?
I came over as soon as I got your text
It's late
Is everything okay?
You have to help me, doctor
I don't want to be a monster
What's wrong?
It's my wings
I hadn't checked them since my devil face returned
I was afraid they might have gone
I was afraid what that might mean
What that might say about me
But earlier this evening I looked
And?
They're still there
That's good Isn't it?
I need to warn you
about the prophecy
Prophecy?
You see, I thought that the prophecy was about you, Chloe
But I realize now that I could have been wrong
If it's not you, then who else could be Lucifer's first love?
I saw them
It was bad
It was really bad
You know who it is, don't you?
Is she here?
I thought I could fix it so
So I didn't hurt him I stopped myself
- So I don't understand why Why? - Why what?
I just need you to hear the prophecy
All right
When the devil walks the earth and finds his first love
Why are they still like this?!
evil shall be released

Lucifer What's going on?
You've been avoiding me, Dr Arn, so I had to force a meeting
Yeah, sorry about that
- Work has been so crazy - Don't care
I granted you a favor Now you owe me one It's time to pay up
I need a medical consultation
If I was to tell you I had a mole or two on my back
perhaps you could reshape them, maybe zhuzh them up a bit?
I'd have to see them first
Not possible, I'm afraid, but
I have visual aids
Wait, you have moles that large on your back?
You need to get them checked out, have them removed
But I tried removing them in the past,
but the stubborn buggers always seem to grow back
I just need you to dress them up a smidge
Maybe you could
attach some white feathers or tattoo them
Something cheery, flowers, maybe
Tattoo your moles?
I was thinking maybe I could get you a discount on some botox, but
I don't need botox, doctor!
What I need is for you to fix them, because they are disgusting!
Please don't hurt me
Lucifer, what's going on?
God, I really need to put a lock
on that elevator
Useless, doctor Get out of my sight
- Lucy, what were you doing to him? - Nothing
Huh?
What happened there, brother? Hit another bridge whilst flying?
That happened one time, Lucy
And no, I got into a fight with Remy
Remy was here?
Oh How is your little clone?
Angry
She wanted to take Linda's baby,
my child, back to the Silver City with her
The argument escalated
Of course, I was victorious and now the child will be raised here on Earth,
which is actually why I'm here
I have a favor to ask you
Oh
Apparently, there's a tradition here on Earth
to ask someone to be a back-up parent
in case something happens to the child's real parents
Oh
Are you seriously asking me,
evil incarnate, to be the child's godfather?
Ha!
The irony
Well, Lucy, this birth is imminent
And I still don't know how to be a father
How am I supposed to prepare?
Well, I would have thought it patently obvious by now
I'm the last person to come to for fatherly advice
But if you really want to know how humans raise their children,
maybe you should, I don't know, ask them
That's actually not bad advice
And as for being the child's godfather, trust me, brother,
the biggest favor I can do you and the child
is to stay as far away as possible
Hey, Ella
Oh, hey, Dan
So what's up?
Nothing Crime scene stuff
Yeah
Cool
So, about the other
Yeah, I wanted to
- Me too - It was
- Totally - But, you know
- Working together - Crossing lines
Bodies crossing
Yeah
Maybe we shouldn't
No, we shouldn't
- Cool - Cool
I'm so glad we could talk about this like adults
- Yeah, okay - Cool
Oh, sorry I'm just
Okay
When the devil walks the earth
and finds his first love
evil shall be released
Everything alright, detective? Did I do something wrong, per usual?
Perhaps I should check myself into detention whilst I'm here
Permanently
No Everything's fine
Hey, guys
Oh, hey, Lucifer
Hey, Dan's ex-wife Ex-wife
I mean I mean Chloe
So what do we have?
- This is Sandra Baez - The victim is Yeah
She was 32 years old and a history teacher
Whatever's happening here is undoubtedly somehow my fault
- Er - Maybe you I'm sorry
Nothing We're all good
- We're totally cool - All good
In fact, the janitor, he's the guy who found the body
claims that Miss Baez, every morning, jogs the track,
showers and then she heads to class
And apparently someone ambushed her as she was getting dressed
And do we have a cause of death?
Cause of death is a blunt force trauma to the head
It turns out that Miss Baez was a faculty adviser
- Yeah, she was - To YEA
Uh, YEA is Youth Academy of American Entrepreneurs
The club met last night,
so probably the last people to see her alive
Right, thank you
Lucifer
Can I talk to you?
Right now
Sure
Okay, well
I need to tell you something
I'm all ears Or horns, rather
I went to see Father Kinley
Oh Did you now?
Conjuring up more ways to send me back to hell, are we?
No No
Father Kinley had been asking to see me, so I finally went and
he told me about
a prophecy
Right
What is it this time? Are frogs about to start falling from the sky or
perhaps winter is coming
All of this celestial stuff, it is new to me
I don't know what is good and bad,
what is real and fake
But what he said
It scared me
Well, come on then, detective What did he say?
He said,
"When the devil walks the earth and finds his first love
evil shall be released"
Well, this is wonderful news
- It sounds kind of bad - Oh, it's bad It's bad, but
it explains why I'm changing
Wait up
listen, if this prophecy were to actually come true
What then? Would there be demons running around?
Nothing of the sort
But let's not get bogged down in specifics,
because none of that will matter if I can stop the prophecy altogether
- How? - Well, clearly the first part,
when the devil walks the earth, has happened,
because hello, here is me, walking the earth
- Yeah - And since Eve was my first girlfriend,
then she's
- Your first love - Exactly
So to stop evil being released, all I need to do is, drum roll, please
Break up with Eve!
So there you have it
I mean, usually these prophecies turn out to be gobbledegook, but
this one seems legit
So
Wow
I had a feeling
or maybe I just knew all along
- Knew what? - That you love me!
Right And how exactly did you end up there?
The prophecy, silly
I mean, if you believe it to be true then,
"When the devil walks the earth
and meets his first love," means you consider me to be your
first love
Ergo!
- You love me - Mm
Oh, my God! I can't believe you said it first
I've been dying to say it for so long
Have you?
Interesting you should focus on that part of the prophecy,
when evil being released really is the
the relevant part
And much as I hate to say this,
I think it means that we need to
you know
break up
No
- No? - Mm-mm
Lucifer, I know what you're doing
- Do you? - Yes
You're scared Because you've been hurt before
You don't have to worry, okay?
I promise you that I will never, ever, ever
give up on you
You know why?
Surprise me
Because I love you too
Ah
Boop!
Shit
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -  <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> 
Thanks for speaking with us, Miss Shaw
Please, call me Lexy
Anything to help find the person who did this
We're speaking to everybody in the YEA club,
because you all were the last to see Miss Baez last night
Did you notice anything out of the ordinary with her?
No She was her normal, cheery self
Miss Baez was awesome She did so much for me
She was also the SAT prep administrator,
so helped me get into my first choice
It was Harvard
- Oh - She's also just so good at giving advice
on anything
School, parents, relationships
Relationships?
What advice would Miss Baez give to, say, a student in a relationship
who, I don't know, needed to break up with someone?
Oh, well, I wouldn't know My boyfriend and I are super-solid
We'll probably get married
After we both finish college At Harvard
Right
Do you know of anyone who may want to hurt Miss Baez?
Not really Well, unless
Have you spoken to Caleb Mayfield?
No Why?
Miss Baez was particularly talented at giving advice to the more
troubled students
Ah
Nah, I didn't really know Miss Baez that well
To be honest, I was thinking about quitting YEA altogether
You were going to break up with the entire club
How does one specifically say nay to YEA?
Could we just stay focused, Lucifer?
Lucifer? As in the club owner who grants favors?
You've heard of the favors?
Some people I hang around with, they may have mentioned it
Well, granting favors is much lower on my resume these days
than releasing death and destruction upon the world
So you didn't spend much time with Miss Baez?
Not really
Did you guys talk to Nate Benedict? He was fighting with her
Mm
We had, you know, words
What were you fighting about?
I was pissed because she was sleeping with my dad
Miss Baez was having an affair with your father?
My parents are separated, and they totally could have fixed things,
but Miss Baez was standing in the way, so hells yeah, I was angry
- I see - But not enough so I'd kill her
And where were you yesterday morning?
At my girlfriend Lexy's place
My dad said he had things he needed to take care of,
He needed me out all night
We'll have to speak with your dad to confirm your story
And his Thank you
Oh
Your parents' marriage failed
What exactly was the final nail in the coffin of their relationship?
Weirdly enough, things got really bad
after they went to couple's therapy
Therapy
Of course
Excuse me Do you have any children?
Why? Did Ramona send you?
Hey, man, I'm all paid up on my child support
Excuse me Do you have a good relationship with your father?
I love all my daddies
Right
Excuse me!
Do you have a good relationship with your father?
I'm dancing half naked in a nightclub for money
What do you think?
Hey
do you know where I could find Lucifer Morningstar?
He's not here right now
- Damn - What do you need from Lucifer?
Just
- a favor Thanks - Whoa, hold up
Maybe I can help I'm Amenadiel, Lucifer's brother
- For real? - As God is my witness
I'm Caleb
So what's the problem, Caleb?
This
Xanax and Adderall
- Where did you get all these drugs from? - A dealer
His name's Tahir
He asked me to sell it at school I did once
I'm just trying not to do it no more
Problem is, he said if I don't, he'll mess me up bad
I was hoping maybe Lucifer could buy them off me
Just take them off my hands Could you?
Listen, even if I did, that wouldn't solve your problem
It sounds like this Tahir would just, you know, make you sell more
What am I supposed to do?
I just want out
Hey, Ella, you wanted to see me?
Yes, Sandra Baez's autopsy report just came in
Great I'll go and get Dan and we can go over it together
No! Don't I'll just tell you what it says and then you can tell Dan
Because, you know, you probably see him all the time,
like when you're handing off Trixie,
the child you made together when you were married together
Okay
So what does it say?
Contusions
Two of them on the victim's skull
Unusually shaped, so it appears that the murder weapon is a golf club
A driver, to be exact
Got it I'll tell Dan that we need a search warrant for the golf lockers
Good
Forensics
Yeah, I worked the Tiernan case
I'm sorry, where did you say you were calling from?
So how do you like being a prison guard?
Boring Unless you get to mix it up, you know, fight with an inmate
How's bounty hunting?
Look, I'm going to get to the point
Usually I go straight for the sex,
but my friend thinks I'm too invested in her baby
thinks I need to find a connection of my own, so
I'm looking for someone I can do that with
Whatever I'm in
You're too clingy This is never going to work
I recently learned, doctor,
that counseling is a good way to help relationships grow, evolve
and then reach their final destination
Yes, it can be
In the right circumstance
Linda, I'm so happy to finally meet you
And being here in this room
Woo! It's kind of like being inside Lucifer's mind
Scary thought
Ha-ha!
Yes, well, I'm very happy to meet you too, Eve
Wow You're the first woman ever
It's like meeting a dinosaur
Not that you look old
I mean, it's like you're my great-great,
great-great
whatever
Ah! Never mind
What can I do for you guys?
I think, if you looked up "perfect relationship" in the dictionary,
you might just see a photo of myself and Eve
Mm!
But complacency is the enemy of excellence, so I thought it wise
to get your expert perspective on our wonderful kinship
I'm guessing this isn't going to end well
Please, tell me about this wonderful relationship of yours
Well, I'd say that we are impulsive
I mean, we often text whilst driving
We moved in together after one day
Also we consume an unfathomable amount of drugs and alcohol
and regularly invite strangers into our bedroom
It's true
Did I mention that Eve has just come out of a long-term relationship?
So, what say you, doctor?
Hm Yes, well
while you claim to be happy,
I'm sensing a hidden trepidation
by the words that you're using to describe your relationship
In fact, I'm concerned
that you're returning to a familiar pattern of
Denial
That's exactly what I was going to say
Don't you just hate it
when he takes the exact wrong message
from every single conversation?
Oh, my God!
Every single time!
- Right Why don't we get back on track? - How have we not met?
- I don't know! - Right, there's a prophecy
Now he's just deflecting
I couldn't have said it better myself
You know, Lucifer has a tendency to
project his issues onto external sources
when what he really needs to do
- is face his issues head on - Head on
Finally!
You sure you know what you're doing?
Caleb, I'm the Silver City's greatest warrior
There's no need to worry Ha!
Tell me something
How did you get involved in this business in the first place?
I met Tahir and his boys at a club
He seemed cool, so I start hanging with them
Then one day, Tahir offered me a way to make some extra cash
Why didn't you just say no?
Tahir's not really the kind of guy you say no to
I'm pretty sure I can reason with this Tahir
convince him to let you off the hook
And then maybe, after
we can go and get some ice cream together
Ha! My man, Caleb
What's good, man?
Oh, you need bodyguards now?
What's wrong? The white kids at school
loving them beans a little bit too much?
Actually, Caleb won't be selling them beans anymore
You see, he no longer wishes to be a
part of your illegal drug operation
- Oh - Excuse me
Caleb is out
His obligation is done
This dude right here means business
But it don't work like that
You see, I've got expenses, and he needs to pay me out,
one way or another
Alright, fine I'll be the one to come back and pay for those drugs
Uh-oh, hold on, man
The honor code's broken right now
You'll have to leave me some kind of collateral
- What about the kid? - That's never going to happen, Tahir
What about that bling around your neck?
This bling is a gift from my father, Tahir It's priceless
That's good
That means you'll be highly motivated to come back with my money
I will be coming back for that
Know this, Caleb
If anything blow back on me, I blow back on y'all
You feel me?
I can't believe she's gone
Miss Baez was a great mentor to Nate
Nate said that you asked him to be out of the house last night
- What was it you needed to take care of? - Work stuff
Work stuff?
Like murdering a beloved teacher?
You think I killed her? That's insane
Is it?
You were sleeping with her
Yes, we were having an affair, but that's over Broke off last week
You didn't have to kill her to break up with her, did you?
Of course not!
- Oh - It was mutual In fact, I already
started seeing somebody else
So you were having an affair on your affair?
Not exactly I started seeing my ex, Emma We had gone to counseling
It was rough at first, but ultimately it helped bring us back together
Now you tell me!
Last night I was with Emma
We didn't want to tell Nate, we didn't want to mess with his head
He had taken our break-up really hard, but he's doing so great lately
He's seeing Lexy, great girl
Crushed his SATs, he got into Harvard
We didn't want to rattle him until
we knew it was permanent
I'll need your ex-wife's information
Er why did you and your wife break up in the first place?
I suppose I was the cliché bad husband
Infidelity, selfishness, neglect
In hindsight, I gave Emma no option but to break up with me
Cliché bad husband, I see
You're going to get it!
Er, babe?
I thought we had plans
Nah, sorry
right, Lynn, you're up next!
Move! Move! Ah! Aha!
Yes! Yes!
Suck it! Suck it!
Yes! That's what I'm talking about
In your face! Ah!
Yes!
Detective How can I help?
We know who the killer is Meet me at the precinct
Right
Erm Eve!
I have to go
Hey, are you sure you can't stay a little longer?
We have queso!
It's work
Yo, did you see the look on their face
when you busted up homeboy's hand?
I told you I've got skills, young buck
Not bad I'll never doubt you again
See, I knew that you were smart
Which does make me wonder, Caleb,
why would you even want to be friends with those guys?
I mean, you must have lots of friends back at school
Yeah, but I don't really fit in with the rich, white crowd
Tahir and his boys, they look like me
They let me be me
I mean, if I knew what they was into in the beginning,
maybe I would have found a new crew to hang with
It's just kind of hard finding your own kind
Your own people, you know?
I've got a question for you
Why are you even helping me?
I, erm
I have a son on the way
Yeah
And I've been worried if I'm going to be a good father
So, what? I'm like a test run for you?
I was just playing, man
I'm cool with it
Are you Caleb Mayfield?
- I said are you Caleb Mayfield? - Yes, this is Caleb, officer
- What's the problem? - We've got a warrant out for his arrest
- He's wanted for murder - Murder?
No No, that can't be right
Down on the ground, hands on your head
Listen, punk, I said down on the ground,
hands on your head
You're hurting him!
- Sir, stop right there, put your hands up - Put my hands, wh
Why are you pointing your gun at me?
I've done absolutely nothing wrong
Put your hands on your head now!
Look, you guys are making a big mistake here, alright?
Now I have friends in the LAPD Just let me call them
- No, no, please just do what they say! - You're hurting him!
- Put your hands on your head! - Get off of him!
I'll tell you one last time, asshole Put your hands up!
- I'm not putting my hands above my head! - Don't make me shoot you
I don't want to shoot you!
Stand down! He's my friend! He's a friend
Are you okay?
A golf club
with Caleb's prints and the victim's blood was found in his locker
Caleb was known to sell drugs,
so the working theory is that Miss Baez found out,
threatened to turn him in, so he killed her
No, Dan
Caleb is not a killer
Okay But the kid looks guilty
What exactly does "looks guilty" even mean, Dan?
Are you talking about the color of his skin?
He's guilty given all the
evidence against him, man Come on, how dare you?
Are you okay?
I know it's not fun to have guns
pointed at you
Why wouldn't those officers listen to me?
I tried to talk to them, reason with them, but they
They wouldn't listen
It's like they'd already made up their minds
Those two cowboy hotheads are way out of line
I'm filing an excessive force complaint against them
as soon as all this is over
And what changes will come
as a result of your complaint?
Probably nothing
Hey, Dan
can I talk to you for a second?
Okay
I'm not really sure how to say this, but
Hold on a second
I thought that we were on the same page about us
This is about the Tiernan case
Right I'm sorry What about it?
To close the case, due diligence interviews were done
by the detective pool
Someone told them that it might've been a cop
who came to Jacob Tiernan
and told him that it was Lucifer himself who broke his son's back
It's an outrageous claim
I know! But what if it's true?
Someone might have it out for Lucifer
I guess it's possible
I could narrow down which cop it could be
by tracking the department cars, but I don't know what to do,
whether to tell Chloe or not
Whoa, Dan!
What are you doing?
I'm flattered, but I just
You're right, we need to be on the same page here,
which is that this is no bueno
I got caught up in the moment
It won't happen again
It's okay Don't worry about it
And the Tiernan thing, sounds like it's way out of left field to me
Yeah Yeah, you're right Er
Okay Anyway, er
Later
Later
So listen, I talked to your parents
They're flying back from vacation
We're going to get you a good lawyer,
clear your name and you'll be out of here soon
Let me ask you something What makes you sure
- I didn't kill that teacher? - I know you wouldn't
You figured all that out by knowing me for one whole day?
Yes I know you wouldn't murder anyone, Caleb
But that doesn't matter So who cares if you believe me?
The cops don't
But you're innocent
The truth will come out and they'll have no choice but to set you free
What kind of bullshit, fantasy world do you be living in, man?
I mean, look what happened to you
You didn't even do anything and you almost got shot
The only truth that matters is theirs
And to them, I am a black kid who is selling drugs,
whose fingerprints were found on the murder weapon
My life is over
Just go Stop wasting your time on me
I'm not leaving you, Caleb
Now, there are good people out there who can find out the real truth,
but they're gonna need your help
And I'm not asking you to have faith in them Have faith in me
Okay?
This is an interesting pair-up, huh?
Loved your profile
And all those stories you made up about murderous exploits
Wow!
Ah Consider me turned on
But
I don't see this working out
I mean, we're both clearly Alphas
We'd just wind up butting heads and locking horns
I just don't see a future together
But have a lovely evening and good luck, milady
Mm-hm
Argh!
Oh, hey, Maze
Have you seen Lucifer?
No
Are you okay?
That was my 21st bad date
And my 22nd is about to arrive any minute
Damn
Talk about stamina
I know this must sound crazy
but I'm starting to think that maybe
I'm the problem
That is crazy
You're awesome
What are you doing on these dates?
Normal stuff
Okay
Well, why don't we
figure this out Let's practice on me
We can pretend to be on a date and then
try to figure out what's going wrong
Okay
Okay
I'll start
Hi I'm Eve
Hey I'm Maze
Nice to meet you
Want to have sex?
Good
There's nothing wrong with having sex on a first date
But, you know, maybe just wait a few sentences before you go there
Okay, tell me about yourself
Well, I like sex
Good
And?
It's just hard to open up about my life
- I am a demon after all - What's wrong with that?
Anybody worth dating should understand everything that makes you
you
Anyway, don't you have another hot date coming?
Looks like he's a no-show
Why don't we keep going?
You know, this is really helping
Yeah
So how are things going with Eve?
Not good
I tried being a super bad boyfriend so she'd break up with me,
but it failed spectacularly
Of course it failed, Lucifer, because that's not who you are
How do you know who I am?
Caleb Mayfield is innocent, Chloe,
you really need to look into it
Did he say something to you?
Yes! That he's being set up
Did he say by who? Because I've been looking at it as well and I agree,
something doesn't add up It's just too easy
Whoever framed him must have known
that he would make a really good target
- You mean they knew he sold drugs? - Yes
I had Caleb write down a list of all the kids that he sold to
Here's a list of everyone who had access to the golf closet
If one of these kids is on Caleb's list too,
then that person would have means and opportunity to set him up
So let's see
No None of the names match
Aren't those two dating?
Lexy Shaw and Nate Benedict And they're each other's alibi
I'm sorry I didn't come forward sooner
I was afraid
Maybe I didn't want to accept it
That he could do something like this
So Nate killed Miss Baez?
I love him
But he can get so angry sometimes,
- it's scary - Mm-hm
And Nate was devastated when his parents split up
I think he blamed it on Miss Baez
I just never thought he'd go this far
Lexy, let's take a break, alright? And I'll go grab you some tissues
She's lying
Then tell them the truth, Nate Now
It's all because of stupid Harvard
Lexy had to get in She insisted that I go too
And she got us a ton of Adderall so we could study harder
My grades went up and then the SAT came
and Miss Baez was the test administrator
You stole the test
We knew she had a copy in her office
I didn't want to do it and she made me
And then Miss Baez found out
That's why you were fighting after the YEA meeting?
She told me that if I didn't come clean,
she was calling my dad and then the cops
And when I told Lexy, she freaked
Said, "I have worked too hard to get into Harvard
and I'm not letting Miss Baez ruin it,"
and she made me steal Caleb's club
You? You killed her?
No! I couldn't do it, but Lexy Lexy did
And I'm just as bad because
Because I covered it all up and I lied
about Caleb He didn't do anything
Why should we believe you, Nate?
- I'm telling the truth and I can prove it - How?
Lexy's bloody clothes
I was supposed to get rid of them and I didn't
I didn't even care about Harvard
Lexy just wanted me to be someone I'm not
and I should have stood up to her before anybody got hurt
I'm so sorry
So you're free to go
You got your necklace back
Yeah, I paid off Tahir, so
you don't have to worry about him anymore
Looks like I owe you a favor now
How can I get you back?
Know something? I've been thinking about that
and I will accept nothing less
than a game of one-on-one tomorrow
As long as we can get ice cream afterwards
By the way
- you got nothing to worry about - About what?
Being a dad
You gonna to crush it
I'll see you tomorrow
And he got all upset with me because I laughed at the end of the movie
I thought it was a comedy
Have you seen it?
Marley And Me?
No
But maybe we can watch it together
Yeah, that would be nice
Ah
Anyway, enough about my bad dating stories
Don't you have any?
Bad dating stories?
Er, no I was married for, like, thousands of years
And then, on my second try, I found the one
Yeah, but how did you know that Lucifer was the one?
With Adam, I guess I felt like I was always trying to be
someone that I wasn't
And then, with Lucifer
I feel like I can just be myself, you know?
At least I did
Lately, I feel like he's
kind of pulling away from me
That's just Lucifer He can be a self-sabotaging jackass sometimes
But he will come around
He'd be a fool not to You're way too awesome
Want another drink?
- You need another drink? - Yeah, I do
Yeah
Yo, Mazy-Maze
What's going on?
We're having a drink, bro
Yeah, 'cause it kind of looks to me
like you're making the moves on Lucifer's girl
Well, it kind of looks to me like you're wasted
Don't sweat it
I'm not going to say anything, because you and me, we're the same
You should've seen how I played Ella today
And assholes like us
we've got to stick together
I am not interested in Eve, Dan
We're just talking You know, hanging out
That's great That's cool
Because that means that you won't care
if I take a shot
Back off
Whoa, so I struck a nerve after all
I'm going to do you a solid, okay?
I'm going to go tell Eve exactly how you feel about her
Come on, Maze
Is that all you've got?
Come on, give it to me!
Come on
You want me to hurt you?
You're trying to punish yourself
Get him out of here
Eve?
We
we need to talk
I've been thinking
Actually, I have something I want to say first
Go on
Tonight, a friend helped me realize that
I'm great
No You know what?
I'm awesome
And
I deserve to be treated well
You're right
And you are
so much more than awesome, Eve
You have a light inside of you that brightens the world
and a smile so infectious
that it captures the heart of anyone lucky enough to see it
And
I'm sorry for the way that I've treated you lately
You don't deserve that
- That's all I wanted to hear - Which is why
I should have just said this straight away
I want to break up with you
I don't
understand
I've been trying so hard to
please you
I've made friends with all your friends
You see that's just it
You shouldn't have to change for anyone
And neither should I
Eve, I have been trying so hard to make you happy too,
trying to be someone I'm not
Or at least
someone I don't want to be anymore
And you deserve to be with someone that wants what you want
I want to be with you
And I don't like who I am with you!
I don't
Sorry
I have to take this It's work
Detective, how can I help you?
No, I don't know where Amenadiel is Why?
Amenadiel
I promise you, we will find whoever did this
I know who did this
I'll drive
What's the damage, big man?
- Caleb - I warned that boy not to do that, man
They've lost themselves
Earth is
no place to raise my son
How's Amenadiel doing?
You know
tormented
And how are you doing?
I broke up with Eve
Well, you know, I'm sure,
if it's what you wanted, then it's all for the best
It is what I wanted
She was in love with the person I used to be
I understand
You've changed
You've become a better man, Lucifer
You see, that's just it, detective
Eve sees me in a different way
Mm
But so do you
That's what makes you so
So special
The fact you see me that way
But I don't like
how that makes me feel either
This is all his fault
What is?
Every bad thing that's ever happened
With Eve,
with the detective
Dear old Dad's back up to his old tricks, manipulating me
Using these two women to
tear me apart
Do you really believe that?
With every fiber of my being, but I also know it's a lie
A grand deception I've been telling myself for
since before I can remember
Why do you think you've been lying to yourself all this time?
Because the truth is so much harder to face
What is the truth?
My devil face
My
devil wings, everything that's happening to me,
it's my own bloody fault
I brought this upon myself How's about that for starters?
Don't you see? This is progress
Genuine progress
Unraveling these patterns of denial
is the first step toward resolving these issues
No, doctor, this isn't progress
Because if I'm doing this to myself, then the real truth is
Is what?
Is what?
Come on, Lucifer
This will weigh on you unless you face it head on
The real truth is what?
There is something rotten inside of me
I find it near impossible
to drown out the constant cacophony of voices whispering in my ear,
telling me I am evil
I'm drowning, doctor!
And I can't stop asking myself
why do I hate myself so much?

It'll be great for entertaining or whatever you guys wanna do
- It's just kind of the perfect house - It's gorgeous
- And those marble countertops - Right
They really tie the whole kitchen together
And now here's the garage, room for two cars and storage
Say, the Murphy twins, they're your older sisters, right?
- Yes - It must be so amazing
It really is
You know, it's nice to be a part of a family business
Are they gonna come by?
They can get pretty busy, but sometimes they like to pop in
and surprise people
And there's really nice neighbors all around These neighbors
Lucifer!
Hi
Erm
Listen, about everything that you said last night
It doesn't matter
Er, I really think it does
No, I'm way beyond that, detective You see, I've made a breakthrough
Really? What is it?
I hate myself
Well, I'm not quite sure what to do with that,
but it doesn't sound like a good thing
But of course it is, detective
All my time with Dr Linda has been
about exploring the denial that I'm in,
but I've overcome that now, I've had an honest-to-Devil epiphany
Now all my problems should just, you know, go away
Well, a new case just came in,
but I really do wanna talk about this more later
- I'm gonna grab my keys - Alright
- Hey, Lucifer - Ah! Morning, Miss Lopez
Whoa!
What's wrong with your hand?
Mm?
Lucifer, that is the worst case of psoriasis I've ever seen
This is impossible
I have some creams in my lab Hold on
What are you doing?
I'm gonna punish Lucifer for what he did to you
Where is my shuriken?
I had to hide most of my weapons so Linda wouldn't get rid of them
Oh, yeah!
Thanks
Maze, you can't hurt Lucifer
Oh, I definitely can
No, you can't hurt him because I love him
I want him back
I just don't understand why he would say that
he doesn't love himself when he is with me
What does that even mean?
It means,
he is an idiot,
which is typical for Lucifer
Not realizing how lucky he is
Thanks
How do I get him back?
Lucifer is like any other man
He wants what he can't have
Okay
Okay
I can do that You know, I just need to show him that I'm fine
You know, that I'm fine without him
- I can do that - Yeah
Okay, maybe I can't do that Okay
Unless you help me
- Please! - Well
In the old days,
I could just enter your body and take over
Um demons used to be able to possess humans
But only when they'd just died But then Lucifer forbade it
Why?
Above my pay grade
Must have pissed off someone in the Silver City
It was fun, though
The looks on their faces when you pop up and be "Rah!"
But it'd have to be coming from Hell, Eve, so no luck there
Mm
We'll have to do this the old fashioned way
What is that?
You're gonna get your shit together
And then we are gonna go and rub in Lucifer's face
just how much you don't
need him
Thank you
Since when do you voluntarily wear evidence gloves?
Detective, it's well, I
This is about the other night, isn't it?
Lucifer, I don't want you to feel
like you have to be someone you're not when you are around me
And if this is part of the reason why you think you hate yourself
No need to worry on that front, detective
All my self-hatred is also self-inflicted
No one to blame but myself on that
But I still don't see how this epiphany solves anything
Stop!
"Hammer time!"
'Cause she was killed with a hammer!
Come on, guys, I've been waiting years to do that one
Anyway
Victim's name is Megan Murphy, 34
- One half - Of the Murphy Twins
Yeah, they're local celebrities for their twin shtick
- Any suspects? - The other twin, actually Moira
She was found standing over the body, hammer in hand
She bolted after eyewitnesses saw her
We have a BOLO out, but no luck finding her yet
The realtor who found the body was the twins' younger sister, Beth
And according to interviews,
Beth wasn't aware of any tension between the sisters
Sometimes there's a darkness waiting just under the surface
- Waiting for a chance to emerge - You can't touch this!
Yes, I get it It's the lyrics to the song
No, it's because I haven't bagged it yet and you never wear gloves
Wait, you're wearing gloves
- Did the cream not work? - Cream?
You know what this is?
Haven't a clue
Heard you got a suspect on the run We'll catch her in no time
We? What, you two are working together now?
Yeah
We're partners
She's got a natural talent for hunting bounties
Er, don't you need an actual bounty to be put out?
Because right now there isn't one
Like to get a head start on the competition, Chloe
Eve
There was no need to make a scene at my work
I'm not!
Listen
Luce
What you said
hurt a lot,
but I really think that the break-up was
the best thing that's ever happened to me
- Really? - Mm-hmm
I'm having more fun than ever with Maze
I think it's exactly what I needed
Well, that's wonderful news
Come on, Eve
We've got a murderous twin to catch
Sounds fun
How did I do?
Pretty damn good, lady
Is he still looking? I bet you he's still
Detective, I need to talk to you inside, now!
Okay
Detective, I'm afraid you were right
Things aren't as simple as I thought
In fact, my epiphany may have backfired on me
What do you mean?
- Is that how your face gets - Yes
Though "devil hand" doesn't have quite the same ring to it
Detective, this hasn't happened to me before
It's going to be okay We'll figure it out
Put the glove back on and I'm sure it will go away in no time
That's just it, detective!
It started out as a patch of skin, but now
it's spreading
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -  <font color="#138CE9">wwwAddic7edcom</font> 
This is all your fault
You and your epiphanies
Turns out self-help is actually self-harm
Hey, Lucifer, it's okay to be afraid
That means we're making progress
Oh, we're making progress in precisely the wrong direction
Oh, Lucifer!
What's happening to you?
Exactly what I'd like to find out, and quickly,
because I can't walk around like O J Bloody Simpson forever
Thank you for feeling my pain At least it's not my wanking ha
Please tell me you are not giving birth to that child now
No, no I'm not due for another couple of weeks
It's just Braxton Hicks contractions Ah!
Doesn't mean they don't hurt like a son of a
Alright
- Better - Good
So
We know subconsciously
you control what happens to your own body
So, some part of you is reacting to this revelation
Yes, and it doesn't seem thrilled,
so if you could just de-enlighten me, that'd be lovely, thank you
Look, Lucifer, I think you need to step forward, not backward
You need to dig deeper
If you really hate yourself
you need to figure out why
Daniel
I've had a realization
- I really don't care, man - I hate myself
Okay
What's the punch line?
Well, me, apparently
Because I haven't the foggiest idea why Look at me!
Why would I ever hate me?
- I might have some ideas - Which is exactly why I've come to you
So please tell me more
Er well, you don't take anything seriously
You get away with everything,
- make everything about yourself - Yes, Daniel, I know all that
Please, just dig deeper into your cold
douchy heart
You are the reason Charlotte Richards is dead
Daniel
I need reasons that are actually my fault, not excuses
I should have known you'd be spectacularly useless
So, Moira's on the run
We have contacted family, friends, co-workers, nothing
Still no luck on the BOLO
So, if you were caught standing over the dead body of your twin sister,
where would you run to?
I would run and run And never look back
I mean, she literally killed someone with her exact same face
- How do you do that? - You'd have to hate yourself
Hello!
Detective
this woman may have the answer to my current dilemma,
we need to find her immediately
Sort of what we're trying to do here, Lucifer
So, Moira's phone record finally came in
First call she made after the murder her accountant
Oh If I needed money to skip town, that's who I'd call
- Let's go talk to him - Quickly, we can't waste a moment
Move!
Am I sexier like this
or
like this?
Er
I don't know Yeah
What do you think?
Oh!
Maybe this isn't going to work
Where are they, anyway?
They got the same phone records we did
I promise they will be here
Okay, okay
Okay
What about dating someone else?
Someone
not Lucifer?
Oh, my God!
You're right!
- Yeah? - Yeah!
Of course!
Nothing better to get his jealousy going
than to see me happy with someone else, of course!
How about that detective he hates so much?
You know
Don?
The douchy one
- Dan! - Or
Maybe you deserve better
Like who?
Ah!
Oh Hi, guys
Hi!
Didn't see you there
Ah
Sure didn't
Mm!
Oh! Did you see his face?
You are a genius Of course!
Being with you would make him super-jealous Oh, my God! Thank you!
You're welcome
Thank you!
These two maniacs barged in here and tied me up!
Yes, I can see you've had a most unpleasant time so far
Well, it wasn't all bad
- Back to - I need you to focus
Tell me, why did Moira hate herself so much?
Hate herself? She didn't hate herself
She must have, she literally killed a mirror image of herself
I need to understand why
She called you after the murder What did she want?
Well, that's the thing
She called to accuse me of killing Megan
Why would Moira accuse you of murder?
I tried to ask her that, but then she hung up on me
I love those girls They're like family to me
Less motive, more location
Where is she? Or I gag you again
No, you will not
And we're gonna talk about proper procedure later on
Um, they owned a lot of properties Maybe Moira is at one of those?
I can get you the address
Great
Sorry you had to see that
What? Oh, the snogging
No need to apologize for a bit of fun
Well
when the lightning strikes, it strikes, I guess
Oh So what? You're saying that you and Maze are together together?
I was just looking for the right time to tell you
Well, all I care is that you are happy, Eve
Genuinely
- Are you, though? - Why wouldn't I be?
Did Megan do anything strange before she was murdered?
Anything to help us figure out who killed her?
Her sister killed her
Maybe, but murderers don't often use their first phone call
to accuse someone else
Megan took over her company's finances a couple of months ago
Is that normal?
I figured that she wanted to be more involved in the business
But, then, two days ago,
she dropped off a thumb drive with a copy of her financial files
Which isn't strange, but
she did seem upset
Did you notice anything odd in the files?
I haven't looked, but the thumb drive is in the filing cabinet
- Can I see it? - Sure
Of course I'm fine Why wouldn't I be?
You and Maze it's just a bit surprising
Well, if you think someone else would make me happier
- then maybe - Hey, Lucifer!
- You look cold - Detective, I know I'm wearing gloves,
- but it's actually rather warm - No It's best you stay covered up
Oh! Right Always so thoughtful, detective
Detective, there seems to be a problem
- What is it? - The thumb drive's missing
Someone must have stolen it
What about the name Zoriel?
That's a good name for a warrior
We can call him Zori for short
Or Ezekiel
Zek
Yeah
Erm I was thinking about the name
Jack
Mm
Mm
Short for Jackiel
We could definitely put that on the list
Right after Azmortiel
I was hoping for a more mainstream name
Our child is going to have enough challenges considering his nature
All these names are very mainstream in the Silver City, Linda
But that's not where he is going to be living, is it?
No
No, of course not
But I suppose he could visit
You could fly him up and back down on holidays
Do you guys have holidays?
No, not really
But that sounds great
- What about Michael? - No
Definitely not Michael
Let's keep looking, then
Okay
Ah! Sorry I'm late, detective
I had to run home to replace your ghastly scarf
One thing I refuse to hate about myself is my style
Did you think I was Chloe?
Easy mistake, I guess
We are both thoughtful
- smart - Okay, where is the detective?
You haven't murdered her and assumed her identity, have you?
Lucifer no
Maze and I brought in the runaway twin
I believe Chloe is interrogating her as we speak
Great
Okay I'll
- I'll go and join her in there - Great
I'll just be here, working on the case,
looking for bad guys to bring in to justice
Mm-hmm
Ah, there she is
- The answer to all my questions - Lucifer
Tell me, Moira Did killing your sister make it go away?
- What? - Your self-hatred, of course
If so, do you think if I made a dummy of myself and murdered it,
it might work for me?
What are you talking about?
I didn't kill Megan
Uh?
Two days ago, I got a notice of an overdraft
on our corporate account
I called Megan,
because she handles more of the financial side
She is the smarter one
Ah, so you hated your own lack of intelligence and took it out on her!
It's not particularly relevant to myself, but, perhaps
Moira, please go ahead
Megan told me it was no big deal
I could tell something was wrong, but I just figured she'd handle it
Yesterday
I knew we were showing a house, so I went
But I found Megan
dead on the ground
I picked up the hammer It was instinct
But then I saw Beth staring at me,
looking at me like like I killed our own sister
But but you ran
If you are innocent, why not just explain to Beth that you didn't do it?
Because I looked so guilty!
I figured I had to find out who the real killer was
That's why I called Willy
He claims that Megan took over the financials
for the last couple of months, so
Maybe someone else had access to them?
Megan's husband
Arnold Oh, God, it could've been him
Arnold Okay, good, we will bring him in and
Excuse me
Lucifer, look at this
Detective, please, we both know I'm not a paper trail kind of crime solver
- Is something wrong with his eyes? - Look again!
- Mm? - Mm-mm, no, no
He just was up all night going over the case, he is
tired
We will be right back, Moira
- Dan! - Oh, my!
Maze?
Hey
What the hell you doing here?
Just getting some air
Right
Air
In the backseat of my car that is parked in a garage
Look, I'm sorry
about what I said to you
at Lux the other night I was just drunk
Dealing with a lot
I still am, but
I didn't mean what I said
Don't worry about it
Wait a minute
I was right about you and Eve, wasn't I?
No!
But
why did you think that?
Because I've never seen you look at anyone the way you looked at her
Like you weren't thinking about stabbing them
Can I give you some advice?
No
I only had a few weeks with Charlotte
But we could've had so much more time together if I hadn't waited
And I wish I had that time back
Don't make the same mistake I made
If you have feelings for her, you gotta tell her
I kind of tried that, you know It kind of backfired
So find a way to show her
Grand gesture and all that
What do you have to lose?
Here you go
Is that the husband with a high-priced lawyer to boot?
That bodes well for his guilt
Well, he denied everything
and the search warrant for the house didn't yield any information
Ah, so it is the sister Killed the twin and ran off with the evidence
No, we just got the time of death back
Megan died 30 minutes before Moira was found standing over the body
So she either stopped to admire her work
Or it isn't her
- Does the husband have an alibi? - No, he's still our best suspect
Megan's laptop is missing and he did have easy access to that, so,
maybe he was stealing money from their company
Maybe she caught him and they got into a fight
And after a little brutal murder, he ran off with the evidence
Yeah We're still trying to get the husband's financial records
to see if he spent a lot of money recently,
but his lawyer is stonewalling Er, Lucifer
What is Eve doing sitting at my desk?
Detective, I was going through the case and
Listen, Eve
If you want to dress like me, that's fine
Weird, but fine
But this is an official LAPD case file
I think I know how to catch the killer
Okay, ten seconds, go
Whoever stole the thumb drive was obviously covering their tracks
- Right? - Right
So clearly, there's something in that file
that can help us catch the killer
But Willy never made a copy of the thumb drive
But what if he did?
- Er, he didn't - What if he did?
Well, he didn't, but if we claimed to have a copy of it
- And then stage a sting - Yeah
Have Moira tell the family
that she is selling off the company to a wealthy buyer
And then we have Moira present the fake copy of the financials
to Lucifer, at a party at Lux
Then just sit back and wait for the husband to steal them
You know
that's a very good idea, Eve
- Thank you - Thank you
- Thank you - Thank you
Yes
well done
detective
Lucifer, where are you?
The party started downstairs The husband should be here soon
I'm not going, detective
Mm?
I thought this case would help me understand my self-hatred,
stop what's happening to me, but
I think it's time I face the truth
What truth?
The prophecy, it's coming true
"Evil will be released," right?
Well
The only question that remains
is what kind of monster will I be when it's done releasing?
Lucifer, I'm going to have Father Kinley
transferred to our holding cell
If anyone knows more about the prophecy, it's him
It will take a couple of hours,
but we will figure this out
Okay?
Until then, I think it's best to keep you distracted
I can't go downstairs, detective
Between my sunglasses, scarf and gloves,
I'll look like Stevie Wonder on a snow day
Don't worry I got you covered
A masquerade party
Clever
Detective, you were right This is exactly what I needed
Thank you
Now, all we have to do is wait for Megan's husband to arrive
Then you can take center stage and hopefully, he will take the bait
Oh, there is Moira
I'm going to make sure she is okay
Hey
So everything is going according to plan, huh?
I guess we make a pretty good team, huh?
Indeed
So, when should I move my stuff back in?
What?
Luce, I saw the way you looked at me at the precinct
I understand that I wasn't giving you what you needed before, but
I really think I can now
Ooh!
Oh, my God Lucifer
Your eyes, are you okay? What's happening?
Nothing
Just an end-of-the-world prophecy being fulfilled
But maybe you can help me
Yeah
Of course Of course, anything
Eve
why don't you hate me?
- What do you mean? - I treated you terribly,
I hurt you, I used you
No, you didn't
I did! Deep down, I knew it wasn't gonna work,
but I strung you along anyway for my own selfish wants,
so why don't you hate me?
Because I love you
Well, you shouldn't
This is for a special girl
A grand gesture to help
redefine things
[Lucifer humming] 
[whistling] 
[whistling] 
[clears throat] 
[laughing] Hey! Ha-ha, hey! 
Double trouble! Whoa!

Dad, this is Sheldon's mother, Mary
How do you do?
Nice to meet you
And, of course, Mom
Hello, my hateful shrew
Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard
Hey
Just got an e-mail from the US Air Force
I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it
Dude, the minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it
I mean, they're probably looking at you
through the camera right now
Oh, God
I think someone's following us
Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us
Why is he turning here? The restaurant's the other way
I don't know He uses that traffic app
Maybe there's an accident
Oh, so follow him
Oh, no!
Leonard, if you don't mind,
I think I'm a little tired
I'm gonna call it a night
Sure, Dad
I'm a little tuckered out myself
Well, I will see you all in the morning
Would you like to share a cab?
That would be fine
Where are you staying? I'm at the Westin
Well, so am I
Could I interest you in a nightcap?
I think that you could
Leonard?
Leonard?
What?
You realize you and I could become brothers
We're not gonna be brothers
We're not gonna be stepbrothers
Go to sleep
I hope you're right
'Cause a grown man living with his brother
and his brother's wife is weird
Go to sleep
Okay
Do you think your father's doing unspeakable things
to my mother?
No
Are you saying that
because the things are unspeakable?
Your parents are old
Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30
Go to sleep
Very well
I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward
God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail
was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this
Hey, if you want me to sleep
you're gonna have to stop talking
Previously, on The Big Bang Theory
Hello
I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz
May I ask what this is about?
No, you may not
Very well
Hi Colonel Williams
How can I help you?
O-Okay
Sure, I can meet with you on Thursday
Caltech is fine
Yeah, may I ask what this is about?
I may not?
That's what he said to me
Look at this
Elon Musk has a theory that we're all just characters
in some advanced civilization's video game
So some alien kid spent his money
on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
Well, he doesn't say it's a good game
All right, we got a problem
What's up?
The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope
They want to have a meeting
Really?
Yeah This military guy showed up at Howard's door
He was terrifying
Oh, what did he say?
He gave me his business card
and asked me to please pass it along to Howard
That doesn't sound terrifying
To a white guy born here, no
If you are a brown guy whose name has
a lot of syllables in it-- terrifying
You realize if the military declares our research classified,
they can take the whole thing away from us
And if that happens,
we'll never be able to sell it commercially
There goes our big payday I was counting
on that money-- I need to make as much as my wife
so I don't have to try so hard in bed
You do that, too?
Oh, yeah How do you think I stay this thin?
Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue
We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs
in the military-industrial complex
Isn't that exciting?
You're kidding, right?
Not at all In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers
would march in perfect formation,
harassing civilians, didn't you ever think,
"Hey, that could be me"?
Sheldon, we could be contributing
to a weapons system that oppresses mankind
for the next thousand years
Okay, Howard's on board What do you think, Leonard?
It's pretty late
You think I've got time to run some more simulations
on the cooling system?
Sure, I'm still figuring out
the thermo-acoustic expander
Oh, while you do that
I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid
through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products
of the day's thoughts
What?
It's called sleep and it's my bedtime
Nighty-night, y'all
Hey, hey, hey, you're not going anywhere
We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force
because of you
I know, I was there
Well, wake up!
We're gonna put in a lot of late nights
How late?
Well, I don't know, midnight, 1:00
One o'clock?
I'm not a raccoon
If you're tired, have some coffee
What? You have some coffee
I am having coffee!
And look how irritable it's making you!
Guys!
We're not gonna get anything done if we start fighting
Now, can you please try to soldier through?
Fine
I don't think I can go much longer
It's been three and a half minutes, wake up!
There was water everywhere
It was such a mess
That stinks How long are you out of the apartment?
About five weeks
Ugh! Did you lose anything valuable?
Well, the pipe was over my closet,
so all my clothes are gone
Oh, so nothing Great
Do they know why the pipe burst?
They didn't say
Buildings that have a combination
of copper and galvanized steel
are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion
caused by the mobility of ions in the water
Can't have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did
and not pick up a few things about plumbing
Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us
- Really? - Of course
You can stay in Leonard's room, and we'll stay at my place
You're sure that's not an inconvenience?
No, not at all
And we live with Sheldon,
so the word "inconvenience" has really lost all meaning
So, technically, I'd be moving in with my boyfriend?
I guess so
I'd finally get to live alone with my husband
Oh, my, this is a big step
Mm-hmm
For two of us, it's in the right direction
Why are you all smiling like crazy people?
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
Cohabitation with my girlfriend?
That's a great deal to process
Hmm?
It's only for five weeks
Let me appeal to the scientist in you
Given the five-week end date,
isn't it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment
and collect data on our compatibility?
Don't try luring me in with sexy talk
Okay
Star Trek: The Original Series 
The Enterprise was on a five-year mission
to explore new worlds
Think of this as your personal
five-week mission to do the same
Oh, you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that's how you do it
Okay, why don't you guys stay across the hall
and we will live here?
Very well I'm on board
- Seriously? - Yes
I accept this five-week mission
to share a living space with my girlfriend
Oh This is so exciting
Well, now, don't be surprised if, like Star Trek, 
it's canceled in three
Okay, I'm confused
Which one is Mr Robot?
I'll give you a hint
We're watching Daredevil 
Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy
adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
- Can't - Won't
- Didn't - Don't
I told you,
you can't regulate every aspect of our lives
I can if you'd just roll over and accept your fate
I'm sorry for bringing this over here
Believe me, we know what you're going through
And I-I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is
no backsies
Mm-hmm
Sheldon, I understand
that you like things a certain way
and I'm willing to make some concessions,
but you have to be open to compromise
She's right That's reasonable
Oh, look who's in favor of compromise,
the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter
Hey, she didn't compromise
She settled There's a difference
Yeah You tell him, babe
Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?
Hello, I'm Dr Sheldon Cooper
And I'm Dr Amy Farrah Fowler
And welcome to the first "on location" episode of
Dr Sheldon Cooper and Dr Amy Farrah Fowler present: 
Dr Sheldon Cooper's Fun with Flags 
Hit it
How much will it hurt?
It's just a tiny skin sample
You saw me do it to myself
On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble
in your shoe and ten is the monkey
you thought was your pet biting your face off
A two
Eating a whole Altoid?
Sheldon,
if I'm gonna synthesize a neural network
from our skin cells, I need to harvest them
Now, I've done this dozens of times, but if you're
too scared you don't have to
No, this is for science
I can be brave for science
Thank you
Oh, jiminy, that's cold!
Just think how happy you'll be in a few weeks
when I've converted our skin cells
into functional brain cells
All right, just warn me before you do it
Okay
Three
two and we're done
You tricked me
You didn't say one
It didn't hurt, did it? No
but three, two and we're done is incomplete
You know those things bother me
It's like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah
without yelling
Okay, fine, one
Thank you
Now yell Charge and we can get out of here
Thank you very much Thanks
That is unbelievable
Good for Bert
Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant
Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy
Everything is stupid and I want to go home
That's Sheldon's way of saying
he's proud of Bert, too
Ah
Hey, it's not even called the "Genius Grant,"
it's the MacArthur Fellowship
Just like it's not Frankenstein,
it's "Frankenstein's Monster"
Which brings us back
to that hulking simpleton over there
And if anyone's a genius,
it's me for the way I brought that full circle
How much money did he win?
Over half a million dollars
- Wow - And he doesn't have to use it
for research, he can do whatever he wants with it
Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under
Here he comes Right
Be polite
I know how to behave
Do you?
Hey, congratulations Bert!
Yeah, good for you That's amazing
Thanks
I was as surprised as anybody
When they called and told me
I won, I didn't believe them
And then they said, "No, you really won"
And then I said, "Cool"
Someone call George R R Martin,
this guy knows how to finish a story
I've gotten pretty good at telling it
Well, see ya
Some genius
I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn't even notice
I know, and it was
the greatest sarcastic quip I've ever heard
Well, aren't you a peach
If we're going to be staying in this apartment,
would you be interested in doing a little
redecorating?
Oh, actually, I would
Great, what'd you have in mind?
Let's take every single thing from the other apartment
and put it in here
Well, how about we start a little smaller?
Like moving the furniture around
You know, I have always thought
that this couch would look fantastic
on the curb in front of the building
Look, we can't just throw away Penny's stuff,
but we can ask if she wants any of it back
You know, I wonder how she feels about
all this artwork
Well, I'm sure she misses this one
I mean, it's the greatest gift I've ever given anybody
It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny
It may have appreciated in value
The artist killed himself shortly after painting that
Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back
I can't wait to see the look on her face
when I give it to her again
Look, it's the same smile she has in the painting
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
Hey, Stuart
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm living here again
Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know?
Or is like a possum in the walls kind of thing?
No I needed a place to stay,
and with the baby coming,
I figured they could use some extra help
Hey, tomorrow, who wants to paint the nursery?
I'll do it
Why do you get to do it? I'm the artist
Just because you're starving doesn't make you an artist
Just because I look sickly doesn't mean I'm starving
<b><font color="#FF8000">BERNADETTE:</font></b> Howard?
I think I'm in labor
Oh Oh, okay Okay
Uh, uh, uh, I can do this
We have a plan
Somebody please tell me the plan!
I'll get the hospital bag
I'll pull the van up
Meet you outside in two minutes
Team Baby, go! <font color="#D900D9">(grunting)</font>
<b><font color="#FF8000">WOLOWITZ:</font></b> Oh, man 
This is really happening
You doin' okay?
Here comes another contraction
Let's pick it up!
All right, hold on
I'm gonna drive like we do in India
<font color="#0CEC0C">(horn honking)</font> Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs!
Stop that! This isn't India
Fine
What do one point three billion people know about having babies?
Sorry I know you were just trying to help
I love you
I love you, too We're good
Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?
Yeah Let me finish packing this stuff up
You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff
lying around after New Year's
Yeah, but he doesn't live here anymore
Well, he doesn't live at Walmart, but he still threw
a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter
And that's the same man who complains
you can't find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter
Oh It's Bernadette She says they're running late
"The baby threw up on Howard,
and then Howard threw up on Howard"
Well, he didn't throw up on the baby That's a win
- Hello - Hi
Hi! Welcome back How was Texas?
Oh, you know The Lone Star state Hmm
That should be its Yelp rating
It was not a great trip
Well, you're home now
Yeah It is good to be home
I Oh, good Lord! Is that mistletoe?
Don't you maniacs own a calendar?
I told him to take it down He would not listen to me
Previously on The Big Bang Theory 
Please stop crying
I'm begging you I don't know what else to do
My boobs are empty
Do you want lasagna?
It's okay, it's okay
Shh
What have we done?
What what's all this?
Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day,
so I wanted you to come home to something nice
Oh, that is so thoughtful
Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting
in Santa Barbara and you said
that was the best rosé you'd ever had?
Yeah, I remember us driving up there,
going to the winery and
that's it
And this wine is why
Oh
Hey, what smells so good?
I made your favorite: pizza bagels!
Pink wine and pizza bagels?
It's like eighth grade all over again
I am so lucky to have you
Well, now be careful, these are hot
I-I could explain the thermodynamics
of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust,
but instead, I'm gonna keep it to myself
Oh
You always know what not to say
I just, I can't believe you did all this
Well, you know,
it's easy to take each other for granted and
I never want to do that to you, because
your love,
it's like a river
It's peaceful and deep
Your soul is, it's like a secret
that I never could keep
You did not just quote an NSYNC song
I quoted your favorite NSYNC song
Oh
Mm
Damn
I burped so hard, I died in my game
What's going on with that woman you're dating?
I broke up with her
Why?
She said she didn't want to see me anymore
and I found that insulting
I thought things were going well What happened?
I don't know, she didn't even give me a reason
Oh, not a problem, we can figure this out
What are the reasons women reject Raj?
Can we not play this game?
Doesn't like games That's one
Ignore him
Yeah, sorry about the breakup
That's okay, I'm fine
Of course you're fine
Not every member of a species finds a mate
Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin
Look at the contributions he made
I'm not a virgin, Sheldon
Wha So now you think you're better than Isaac Newton? Oh
No wonder women don't like you
You're not being very nice
What? He said he was fine
Sometimes people say things they don't mean
Oh, that's a paradox
I-If you meant what you just said,
then that means you may not have meant what you just said
Careful, I saw this on Star Trek 
Smoke's gonna come out of his ears soon
Hey Hey, boys How's it going?
Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation,
but it turns out, I was being offensive
So, normal Yeah--
Sheldon, what did you do?
We were discussing Raj's recent breakup
and apparently, I was insensitive to him
It's okay, I'm fine
You Di-- Don't fall for it
He'll get you to compare him to a dead virgin,
and suddenly you're the bad guy
Sheldon, when I said I was fine,
I meant I didn't want to talk about it anymore
Then why didn't you say that?
Because that's not what people do
Well, I would prefer if people told me
exactly what is on their mind
No No, you don't, you really don't
I actually can't say "don't" enough
Well, it certainly would be easier
You have no idea what it's like
to struggle with recognizing emotional cues
I'm sure it's extremely frustrating
Thank you And also a little sad
O-Okay, now you're just showing off
You know, I just read that a team at MIT
developed a device that helps people read human emotions
And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool
It's supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time
Wow, I find that hard to believe
That a bunch of awkward scientists
with no social skills would invent a machine
to do it for them?
I take it back I believe it
You ift's at MIT, I can make some calls
Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype
What do you think?
A machine that reads emotions is intriguing
It could help me be a more considerate friend
Wouldn't that be nice
It could also help me identify my enemies,
discover their fears and then
I could use those fears to destroy them
I like the first one
Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate
in the micro-fluidic channel
Nicely done, Howard
Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied,
so clearly I know my way around tiny things
Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology
and still making inappropriate comments
about the mother of your child
Those are just the things I say out loud
Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately
What's wrong?
I'm looking at the math,
and I think we can make the device
between eight and ten percent smaller
That's great, but the Air Force approved the specs
We're good to go
Yeah It doesn't need to be smaller
Shame on you
Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude?
I'll tell you
We would have the standard and the miniature poodle,
but no toy or teacup
Which by the way,
is not an officially recognized breed,
but that's just poodle politics
Can we please stop talking about poodles?
Fine Candy bars
Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do
Sheldon, we don't need to make this smaller
Your work is done Go home
I don't want to go home
Fine, go for a little walk
Then what?
Just keep walking
Go! <font color="#D900D9">(inhales deeply)</font>
Come on, Raj!
<b><font color="#FF8000">LEONARD:</font></b> You can do this!
There's no way
What is happening?
This is an Euler's Disk
It's a physics toy
that demonstrates angular momentum,
potential energy, and kinetic energy
Aw, look at you watching sports
We're betting to see if Koothrappali
can hold his breath
longer than the disk can spin
Its weight and smoothness,
along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin
for a long time
But Raj is from India, which means
he's no slouch at holding his breath
Okay, I want in Ten bucks says I'll lose interest
before that thing stops spinning
Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night
Kind of busy right now
Oh, an Euler's Disk! Fun! Yeah, we're seeing
if Raj can hold his breath longer than it
Oh Immature
How ya doing?
Mm
He's not gonna make it
Yes, he is! You know,
deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes
have shown elevated markers of a protein
that can signal brain damage
Yeah, see, what's happening here signals brain damage
<font color="#D900D9">(muffled groaning)</font>
My God, how long does this thing spin for?
Ha! You're interested! You're out ten bucks!
It's slowing down! Dig deep!
Like when we bet you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!
<font color="#D900D9">(groaning)</font>
He's not gonna make it!
Yes, he is!
Come on, Raj! It's like
your favorite movie! You're just Waiting to Exhale! 
<font color="#D900D9">(exhales)</font>
Yeah! I knew you could do it!
<font color="#D900D9">(panting)</font>: And j and just so you know,
my favorite movie
is Princess Bride 
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
My father thinks the reason I can't make a relationship work
is because I'm spoiled
All right, how much, exactly, does he pay for?
Okay, I'll tell you,
but please don't judge me
He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards
I'm trying, but I'm judging
Maybe your dad's right
Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself
I have come to an important decision
I will not be accepting your money anymore
That's wonderful
Yes, that is wonderful You will no longer be able
to accuse me of being spoiled
I'm so proud of you
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it
with your delight and relief
Uh-huh
Interesting
Okay
How bad is it?
Let me put it this way--
do you own a barrel and suspenders?
Are you serious?
I'm not wearing this visor to play women's golf
- Hi - Hey
Oh, let me guess
You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms
We're helping Raj figure out his finances
Well, he has a job How bad can it be?
Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high
You couple that with his penchant
for dining out and shopping
Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right?
Because look
He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt
I thought your dad paid your cards
I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself
What emergency happened at the LA Zoo?
That's a penguin I sponsor
They're losing their homes to global warming,
and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon,
so I felt bad
What is Pink Cheeks?
It's intimate waxing Quit looking at that!
Maybe you should find someone
to help you get your finances under control
Like a business manager?
No, absolutely not
You can't afford to hire someone
who'll forbid you from spending your money
on foolish expenses
That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it
What if there's someone who just likes controlling
other people and stealing joy from their lives?
He sounds like a sociopath
We don't know, his mother never had him tested
You're talking about me Very funny
Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget
and forcing Raj to adhere to it
without an ounce of compassion
Wait, wait, who's gonna break it to the penguin?
Okay, Sheldon
Yeah, I'm putting you in charge of my finances
I will not spend another penny that you don't authorize
Very well
Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday
You can't buy one
Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks
Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?
What? Is it another video of him and his dog
Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?
No He can't afford his apartment,
and he's asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live
I want to say "India," but it seems mean
(chuckling)
What's so funny?
Raj is looking for a cheap place to live,
and I wrote "India"
Don't post that; be supportive
Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes
Fine, what should we do?
We're smart I'm sure we can think of something
You want to let him live here?
Oh, we're smarter than that
I know our apartment's small,
but I think we can make room
No, Sheldon
We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue
We do have Sheldon's old room
If he really needs a place to stay,
I guess we should offer it to him
You're a good friend
Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope
that Howard offers him a place to live first?
You're an even better husband
I know if the roles were reversed,
he would do it for me
Where would he stay?
We already have Stuart
Well, we can make some space in the garage
Maybe put a cot out there,
get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate
That sounds awful
Let's hope he thinks so, too
For the last time,
no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues
Wow I'm starting to think you didn't mean it
when you said you wanted to spruce up the place
You know, downward-facing dog
comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana 
Oh, that's beautiful What does it mean?
"Downward-facing dog"
Yeah, I guess they don't have Sanskrit
for "butts up and heads down"
Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra 
If it involves butts, there's a word for it
I thought we were getting breakfast before work
Oh, right, sorry
It's my fault I asked Penny to do yoga with me
If you want, I can get ready in five minutes
It's cute that you think that
Don't worry about it
Hey, can I ask you a favor?
Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?
Sure You're living here for free
I guess I owe you
Bye, Cinnamon Be a good girl
Yeah, bye, sweetie! Bye!
Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard
Okay, and tree pose
Well, she's done
All right, we're about to go live
Everyone on their A-game!
Good energy!
Hello
I'm Dr Sheldon Cooper
And I'm Dr Amy Farrah Fowler
And welcome to a special retrospective,
where we will take a look back at the history
of Fun with Flags on an episode we're calling
Fun with Flags: Behind the Flags:
A Retrospective
We're pinned down!
We can't get through!
Sheldon, get over here and help!
Okay, one second
Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?
I'm trying to shoot
Then use the shoot button,
not the "wonderful thing about Tiggers" button!
Aw
That's it, we're dead
Okay, challenge them again
Doing it right now
Oh, they can't
There's an important Little League game tomorrow
No wonder they beat us, they're jocks
What happened to me?
I used to excel at these things
Kids are always better at video games
Well, I don't like it
Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child
No, but it's not just video games
I downloaded the new OS for my phone, took me a week
to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone
Oh, so our love is not real?
Well, I-I know how you feel
I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets,
practically shot myself across the room
I guess I just need to face it,
I'm no longer a wunderkind
Now I just wonder what's for lunch
Hot dogs
Yay

What's this? Oh, nothing,
just some math we don't need
This is a different approach
You trying to get the guidance system even smaller?
It's just a theory
Well, it's not even worked out
Oh
I want this
Uh, but we've already met the agreed upon specs
Going smaller would require
weeks' worth of new computations
So get the kid with the two shirts to do it
Sir, I mean, if I may,
uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort
into this current prototype
It's a really elegant solution,
and most importantly, it works
You both make excellent points
And thank you for presenting it so articulately
Make this
Champagne,
champagne, Thank you
and for the world's tallest second grader, apple juice
No bendy straw, some party
Hey, a-a toast
Thank you all for your support
while we worked on our Air Force project
And please know that
we could not have done it without you,
so cheers
Cheers
You know, it's nice of you to acknowledge us,
but this is your accomplishment
Yeah, you guys did this all on your own
Without me
To success without Raj
So what happens next?
Phase two,
we test it, perfect it,
and hope to live long enough to see the movie
based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us
Yeah, I'll definitely live long enough--
vitamin C
First thing tomorrow morning, we're back at it
Without me
I hope his character doesn't make it into the movie;
he's kind of a bummer
Leonard Hofstadter
Access granted
Hmm I don't care if this thing's burning out my retinas;
it makes me feel special
Now, before we field test, I think we
What the hell?
Where is everything?
Who else has access to this room?
It's a secure lab in a classified facility;
only the US government and us
This is very disconcerting
But the movie did just get good
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton
Princeton
A fine institution
The place where Albert Einstein taught,
and where Leonard got his PhD,
so it may have gone downhill
And just remember, I'm proud of you
And I support you in all that you do
Thank you
That means a lot
Oh, and one last thing
If you find yourself working with a male scientist,
who's as smart as me, as tall as me,
and has hair like Thor,
well, then, I want you to step away from the situation
and call me immediately
How are you settling in?
AMY: Pretty well
Princeton has a beautiful campus
Now, I've learned some fun facts about New Jersey
to help you make small talk
Would you like to know
the state bird or the murder rate?
They're both shocking
Actually, I want to hear about you
How are things at home?
Well, I'm a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch
or be murdered, I'll tell you that
I miss you
I miss you, too
It's so strange, earlier today I ended a sentence
with a preposition
and you weren't there to correct my grammar
I'm sorry you had to go through that
In fact,
that's when I started to really miss you
You know you just split an infinitive
Did I?
Are you gonna teach me a lesson?
I am
It is naughty to put an adverb
between the word "to" and the verb stem
What are you gonna do about it?
I'm going to admonish you
Vigorously?
That's the only kind of admonishing I do
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton
A fine institution
The place where Albert Einstein taught,
and where Leonard got his PhD,
so it may have gone downhill
Gentlemen, you may remember Dr Nowitzki
She's back at Caltech for her postdoc
- Hello - Hi
are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?
What if I were?
Well, that would raise a number of problems
We're colleagues, I'm currently in a relation
Amy? Amy
Amy?
Will you marry me?
One moment, please
Really, you're going to answer that right now?
It's Leonard
I don't want to be rude
Hello?
Oh, hey, where you been?
We've been calling you for hours
Oh, I'm sorry, my phone was on "airplane" mode
Why?
Because I was on an airplane
Hey, put him on speaker
- Yeah - Hey, where are you?
I came to Princeton to see Amy
It's a funny story, actually
I was having lunch with Dr Nowitzki,
and she kissed me
- Excuse me? - What?
I'm sorry?
And in that moment, I realized
that Amy was the only woman I ever wanted to kiss
for the rest of my life
So I came to New Jersey to ask her to marry me
Oh, that's so sweet
- Sheldon - Yeah, although
there was one man whose blessing I needed first
I've thought about it, and I really want to spend
the rest of my life with Amy
Do I have your blessing?
Well, Sheldon
I think you should make her finger like Saturn
and put a ring on it
You asked Stephen Hawking and not her father?
Stephen Hawking's a genius
If he said no, I wasn't gonna waste my time on her father
But you did ask my father?
I did He said yes
Although, not in a robot voice, so it wasn't nearly as cool
Okay Oh, my God, I can't believe you guys are engaged
We're not engaged, yet
She's taking forever to answer
Because you're on the phone!
We'll call you back
She said yes
Yay! Congratulations!
Uh, One dumpling left Who wants it?
Maybe you should offer it to the pregnant lady
And that would be
Me, Sheldon
I'm obviously pregnant
Well, you never said it to my face
And the last time I assumed a woman was pregnant,
it did not go over well
Yeah, I'm still mad at you
You were drinking water instead of wine
What was I supposed to think?
Sheldon's right
I would never ask a woman if she was pregnant,
unless she tells me or I see a human being
wiggling out of her
Well, Sheldon, I'm pregnant
Congratulations How far along are you?
About three months
Only three?
Good gravy, how many babies are in there?
Okay, let's talk about something
that won't infuriate my pregnant wife
I read an interesting fact about elephants
Try again
Oh, I've got something
I'm being interviewed on public radio this Friday
Oh, cool How come?
Uh, the university is trying to get more funding
for the physics department,
so they want me to go out and talk it up
Really? You?
Well, they picked the right person for the job
Thank you
I think he bought it
Hmm Some news of our wedding
I have sent you all
a "save the date" e-mail
Oh, exciting You guys picked a date?
Better I picked 80 dates
And I need you
to save them all until we narrow it down
I thought we agreed on June 15
That's the day after Flag Day
Everyone'll be partied out
It's a date-- just pick one
It's not just a date-- it's a textbook optimization problem
There is a perfect date-- just like there's
a perfect room temperature and a perfect dessert
Mm There's no perfect dessert
Yellow cake in the shape of a dinosaur
with chocolate frosting, a scoop of vanilla ice cream
on the side, not touching
You'll see
You'll have it at our wedding
You wanna bet?
SHELDON: You give me
enough time, I can do the same thing
with a wedding date-- it needs to be on the weekend,
uh, not near any of your birthdays,
or the weekend of Comic Con
Ooh, you could get married at Comic Con
AMY and PENNY and BERNADETTE: No!
We just need a weekend date
that's completely boring and uneventful
Too bad you didn't get your ducks in a row,
'cause tonight would have been perfect
It feels like it wasn't that long ago
we were here doing this for Halley
'Cause it wasn't
Which reminds me, before we leave,
let's get you a vasectomy
Oh, that's sweet, but today is all about you
So, you two ready to find out the sex of this baby?
Yeah Absolutely
Is Halley hoping
for a little brother or a little sister?
Well, she's nine months old,
so unless it jingles or is in my bra, she doesn't care
And how about you two?
You know, for the first one, we really wanted a girl,
but this time around, we don't have a preference
Yeah Boy, girl, as long as it's healthy
Well, it's a boy
(heartbeat pulsing)
Oh Oh
Come on, you can't really be disappointed
Hey, I barely know how to be a man myself
Now I have to teach someone?
As the saying goes, Those who can't do, teach"
Don't you want a little version of Howard?
I already have a little version of Howard
Now I'm having a son?
I'll have to teach him how to play sports,
and-and watch sports
and-and-and-and-and-and
He just ran out of man things He's in trouble
It's okay We're all here to help
Yes And this baby will have plenty of manly role models
Now, I'm certain that whatever Bernadette can't teach him,
Penny can
Uh, she can pee into a bottle
Mm-hmm
Anything with a neck wider than a nickel
Howie, there's a lot of amazing things you can teach a son
Yeah You do always know how to pick just the right antacid
I don't know if I can teach that
It's just something I was born with
Come on You can build things
You were an astronaut
That's true
You know, as a kid, I used to make model rockets
That'd be pretty cool to do with a son
Model rockets Finally, something interesting
What is your preferred mode of recovery?
Sheldon, we're helping our friends
And we got to model rockets, yeah?
It was a tedious road, but well worth the effort
- So, have you thought of any names? - Amy
We finally got to model rockets
Why are you turning back?
Thanks for letting me put Halley in your room
Yeah, no problem
Oh, and, Penny, she kinda threw up on your stuffed bear
Oh, that's okay
Hey Tha-That's an Ewok and it's mine
Yeah, which is why it's okay
See, he gets Ewoks in his bed
You've got Chewbacca; that's enough
KOOTHRAPPALI: I used to have
the stuffed raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy, 
but Cinnamon licked it raw
There's a time and place for your randy dog stories,
and it's never and nowhere
Yeah, no more stories about sex,
so, Amy, that brings us to you
Well, at work we've been doing
some interesting research with neuroprosthetics
PENNY: Neat
I've been rewatching The OC, 
so we're all leading productive lives
We've been working on a computer interface
that can use brain wave patterns to control robotic limbs,
but we're having a little trouble localizing
the signal from the EEG cap
Oh, well, have you thought about adding a phased array of sensors
for better localization?
Actually, that never occurred to me
It never occurred to me
I would miss the Ewok conversation
Good, 'cause I just bought another one on Amazon
You know, I could use an engineer on this project
Well, now, this works out great
Howard's an engineer
I'm sure he knows someone qualified
She was talking about me, Sheldon
I'm perfectly qualified
Yeah, Howie's the world's best engineer
It says so right on his coffee mug
Aw, you got him a mug?
I did
But it's not a competition
Yeah, I lost that battle years ago
So, Howard, are you interested?
Are you kidding?
If I could control robot arms with my brain,
I'd be able to do so many things
Really? Because you've been controlling human arms
with your brain for years and not much has come of it
Howie, slow down
I can't
I'm not allowed to eat for 12 hours before my surgery,
and I only got two more minutes
What surgery are you having?
I'm stress eating
My best friend's getting a vasectomy tomorrow
And you're sad you won't be able to bear his child?
Oh, my goodness
If it's vasectomy gone wrong videos,
he's seen them all
Including the one of the guy who's sitting
on what appears to be a cantaloupe but is not
And I'm done
They're going to start making
Professor Proton's science show again
<b><font color="#f93200">BERNADETTE</font></b> : I thought he passed away
He did
He was cremated, and his remains
were put in a baking soda volcano
<b><font color="#f93200">AMY</font></b> : Don't make jokes
He meant a lot to Sheldon <b><font color="#f93200">LEONARD</font></b> : Oh, me, too
I grew up watching his show
He's one of the reasons I became a scientist
Aw Thought you did it just to get girls
Joke's on you It worked
Have they found anyone to replace him?
No, not yet, and it won't be easy
Arthur Jeffries was an accomplished scientist
Mm
You know who'd make a great Professor Proton?
Meryl Streep
She's not a scientist
Uh, then explain to me why
she has chemistry with literally everyone
It would be nice if they cast a woman
Oh, you've already got Doctor Who and the Ghostbusters 
Leave us something
Who do you think it should be?
Well, it should be a scientist I respect
You know, someone with a pleasing voice
and symmetrical facial features
Is he talking about himself?
If he's talking, he's talking about himself
I just know how much Professor Proton touched me as a child,
and I feel that I owe it to him
to try and touch as many children as possible
You should put that on your audition tape
Hey, uh, who's free tonight?
- Oh, I think I'm - Hang on
We've made this mistake before
It's how we wound up at
his cousin Deepak's Tupperware party
Hey, you use that collapsible bowl all the time,
and you know it
And it's not like that
I just thought we could, you know, hang out and go to a bar
- Sure - Very well - Sounds fun
And watch cricket
That sound you hear, ironically, crickets
Hey, guys
Hey, Bert, how you doing?
Well, you know, we geologists
always get a little sad when Rocktober's over
- Wordplay? - Yes
Funny wordplay?
- What do you think? - Eh
Trust your gut
Sheldon, I've got these
four-billion-year-old meteorites
I thought maybe they'd show signs of neutrino interactions
I could really use someone like you to help me with the math
Oh, so they would act as natural dark matter detectors
That sounds interesting
It does, but it's still geology
Sorry, Bert, I don't have time to play rocks with you
I'm not asking you to play rocks
I'm asking you to collaborate on a research project
Although, if there's time,
I guess we could play a round
of zinc, zinc, piece of quartz
Does sound better than cricket
Thank you for asking
Unfortunately, I have real science to do
But you feel free to rock on
That's how you do it
All right
Sheldon, what are you doing?
Bert's one of the top guys in his field
And somewhere there's a mime who's top in his field,
but you don't see me rushing to collaborate with him
on new ways to be stuck in a box
Also something I would watch instead of cricket
Oh <font color="#FF5500">(chuckles)</font>
Hello
Hey, Sheldon
I've been thinking about it, and I suppose
I-I could help you with your research
What changed your mind?
Bert, I'm a gift horse
Don't look me in the mouth
Sorry I'm happy you want to help out
If it's easier for you, we could just work at your office
No, no, no, not my office, no
Uh, let's-let's do it here,
in-in the evenings, after everyone's gone home
I just have to see if my evenings are free
That's a joke They are
Okay
Well, then I will see you tonight
<font color="#FF5500">(gasps)</font>
Well, you know what?
<font color="#FF5500">(stammers)</font> Close the blinds We can start right now
Can we start the movie?
Before Sheldon gets here?
Last time we did that, he didn't talk to us for a month
So do it!
Hold on Where is he?
Well, according to his text, he was on the second floor,
then he stopped to tie his shoe
All tied, and
Hello! Hi
Sorry we're late
Amy took forever tying my shoe
All right!
Who's excited to see a documentary?
Oh, I know this one
Nobody ever
Hey! This one's going to be great
This is about the rivalry
between a cool renegade scientist, Nikola Tesla,
and his arch-nemesis, Thomas Edison
It's the greatest scientific feud of all time
I mean, you can forget about Leibniz and Newton
Done
So, Tesla's the one that invented the electric car?
No, Penny
No, the car is just named after him
Okay, you don't have to be so smug about it
You know, you went to see that movie It 
because you thought it was about scary IT guys
Tesla was a genius who invented our electrical grid
Edison just wanted to get rich and famous
Didn't he invent the lightbulb?
That's what he wants you to think
But without the foundational work of Ebenezer Kinnersley,
Warren de la Rue and James Bowman Lindsay,
you wouldn't know Edison any more than you know
Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de la Rue or James Bowman Lindsay
Isn't he sexy all fired up?
He really gets my current alternating,
if you know what I mean
Edison was kind of a publicity hog and a bully
Yeah, he electrocuted an elephant named Topsy
just to make himself famous
If I had an elephant named Topsy,
he would want for nothing
Also, he'd be named Jumbo
And worse than that, Edison filmed the first on-screen kiss,
so he's basically a pornographer
Although every time I put that in Wikipedia,
someone takes it out
Is your current still alternating?
We're lucky there aren't any elephants in here
? Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state ?
? Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait! ?
? The Earth began to cool ?
? The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools ?
? We built the Wall ? ? We built the pyramids ?
? Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery ?
? That all started with a big bang ?
? Bang! ?


You know, that documentary last night was actually
better than I thought it would be
Really?
Should've been about Samuel Morse
the way they telegraphed that ending
I already pretended to laugh at that joke once
Do I have to do it again?
Yeah, I'd appreciate it
Samuel Morse You kill me
Leonard, can you drive me to work?
Yeah, sure Oh, hey, the guys and I
were talking about going to see the Tesla coil
at the observatory later on, if you want to join
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't I'm busy
Why? What are you doing? Leonard, what are you doing?
He said he can't go Make a sad face, move on
It's fine
I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to
What does that mean? Leonard!
Sad face, sad face
I mean, I would like to, but I just can't, you know,
because it's classified and top secret
Hold on, are you still working for the military?
I'm so glad you figured that out!
It was killing me keeping it a secret!
I thought they fired you guys
They did, but then they hired me back
Well, you better not be working on our project,
because we're a team
Leonard, there is no "I" in team
However, there is an "I" in
"I'm working with the military and you're not"
There's five of them, in fact
Hey, hey
I got a big surprise for you
Is it pie and ice cream?
Wow, did I oversell it
It's Raj and Ruchi!
Hello
Hey Hi
Hey, what are you two doing here?
We won't stay long
I just wanted to drop something off
from me and the girls at work
None of the girls at work like me enough to get me a gift
Okay, so you'll know why everyone at the office
has the same handwriting
I really appreciate the thought,
but it's not necessary I'll be back soon
Don't worry about work You take all the time you need
Yeah, just turn off your brain
and let your uterus do its magic
It's the star of the show now
Okay, wasn't sure how long I should let you guys stay
Now I know! Get out!
Good to see you You look amazing
Thanks for coming!
That bitch
Oh, come on, he means well
He's just trying to impress his girlfriend
I'm talking about Ruchi
She's after my job
Why do you think she said, "Take all the time you need"?
Because she was being nice?
No, she's trying to steal my projects while I'm at home
taking care of this useless plant and my dumb family
I'm only saying this because I love you
and because you can't reach me from that bed,
but you sound a little crazy
I love you, too, but I could fling this card in your eye
like a ninja throwing star
I don't believe you
Why would the military want Sheldon?
I don't know Target practice?
Well, he better not be working on our guidance system
That was my idea
Why don't we call Colonel Williams
and find out what's going on
Great I want answers and he'd better give them to us
Hello, gentlemen
Hi, sir Um, Leonard has a question
Hey, is Sheldon working on our project again?
Did he say that?
No, he wouldn't tell us
Huh So he can keep his mouth shut
How do I get him to do that?
Is he working on our guidance system or not?
Dr Cooper contacted us with an idea on how to modify
your technology into a communication system,
and it seemed interesting
But our team developed that technology
And he was your team leader
Well, who said he was team leader?
He did
And I like that kind of "take charge" attitude
We can have "take charge" attitudes
Then why didn't either of you ask to be team leader?
We didn't want to step on anyone's toes
Yeah, so we were just
waiting for you to tell us who you thought-- Okay, I hear it
- Are we done? - No, no
I am taking charge right now and telling you
that it is not okay with us if
Okay, bye
Hey I just got your text Everything okay?
Yeah, there's just something I need to ask you
Oh, Bernie, I'd be thrilled
It's not be my birth coach
Okay, that hurts, but luckily I know how to breathe through it
I need you to find out if Ruchi's trying to steal
my projects at work while I'm on bed rest
She's not that kind of a person
She's-she's generous and charitable
You're just saying that 'cause she's sleeping with you
Yes, that's my favorite charity
I know I sound paranoid, but I'm feeling really vulnerable
If there's anything you could find out, it'd be great
And if she is up to anything, what are you gonna do?
Nothing
I'll just calmly talk to her and explain
there are certain boundaries that need to be respected
It's really for the benefit of everyone at the company
Uh, okay, what you're saying sounds nice,
but the way you're saying it
is causing my testicles to take cover in my abdomen
What do you want to watch?
Oh, why don't you pick
Okay, how about comedy?
Eh, I already laughed today
I know It was when I stubbed my toe
Still funny
Drama?
Nah, I've already seen someone cry today
It really hurt, Sheldon!
Hey
We talked to Colonel Williams
He told us everything
I'm sorry, can we do this another time?
Amy's just about to realize she wants to watch a Hulk marathon
What's going on?
Sheldon went to the Air Force behind our backs
I did nothing of the sort
I had an idea
for a neutrino-based communication system,
I presented it to them, and they were interested
But y-your communication system
was based on our guidance system
And sonar is based on bats
You don't see them hanging upside down
in a patent attorney's office
You know what, you like to think that you're just like Tesla,
but the truth is you're exactly like Edison
You take that back
No, he's right
You are a bully, a credit hog and a self-promoter
And if anyone around here is like Tesla, it's us
Yeah
Can you believe they said I was just like Edison?
Yeah, and in front of a lady, no less
Well, you are building on their work
and taking the credit for it
That's a classic Edison move
Oh, yeah?
Well, if I'm Edison and you love me,
then what does that say about you?
I honestly don't know
Okay
Well, I have to Google some stuff about Mrs Edison
I'll be right back
You know whose fault this is?
I do
Yours
No, my mother's
"Go make friends, Sheldon"
What happens?
20 years later, they call me names
I don't think what they called you is the point here
Oh, yeah? How would you feel
if I called you the name of a neuroscientist you didn't like?
Do you know the name of any neuroscientist?
Of course
Not me?
Then no
Do you think they're right, Amy?
Do you think I'm like Edison?
Sheldon, I don't think you're upset
because of what kind of scientist they said you're like
I think you're upset because
your friend'' feelings got hurt
You're right
I care too much about other people's feelings
It's always been my fatal flaw
Sheldon, I don't think
No, no, not now, Amy I'm growing as a person
Ah, that was fun
Put her there, buddy
I am not fist bumping you after we have sex
You're the one who wanted to keep things casual
There's a difference between casual and weird
Not the way I do it
So, um how was, how was your day?
Like, how's-how's work?
Oh, great
With Bernadette gone,
I'm getting to handle all her projects
Well, she's-she's not gone
She'll be back soon
Not too soon, let's hope
So it turns out Ruchi is totally
trying to take over Bernadette's projects
Wow, she just told you that out of the blue?
Yeah, yeah, we had just made love
It was so beautiful
Our caramel-colored bodies
were entwined like erotic taffy
Get to the point! Oh
Uh, sorry, uh, yeah
I-I asked her about work, and she just admitted
she has her eyes on Bernadette's projects
Can't believe she would take advantage
of a pregnant lady like that
So what did you do?
What do you think I did?
I made small talk for 20 minutes and had sex again
You have to say something to Bernie
I don't know If I do that, she's gonna confront Ruchi,
and then Ruchi's gonna stop sleeping with me
Raj, you can't go on sleeping with a woman
who's trying to screw over your friend
Can't or must?
You know, that guidance system was my idea
You figured out how to make it work
We didn't even need Sheldon
Let's not forget your idea was based on my theory
Hey, we're bagging on Sheldon here! Focus!
I guess it was pretty smart using our quantum technology
as the basis for a communication system
Be even better if he swapped out the helium for xenon
Ooh So instead of having to keep it at negative 271 degrees,
you'd only have to keep it at negative 108
It would be way more efficient
And xenon has a bigger nucleus,
so coherence would make it an easier signal to see
You're brilliant!
We should tell Sheldon
You're an idiot!
We don't tell Sheldon
We go to the military behind his back
and we screw him like he screwed us
All right, you're right, you're right, we don't need him
We can do this all on our own
Do you think you can do the math?
No
But if someone else does it,
I can double check the crap out of it
I want you to know, I did what you asked
I talked to Ruchi and found out what's going on at work
So is she trying to steal my projects?
No, not trying to, sounds like it's a done deal
Here, have a brownie
I'm gonna kill her
Okay, don't take this out on Ruchi
Is she trying to take your job? Yes
Is she parking in your space? Yes
Did she get a laugh at a meeting yesterday
by calling you "Pregnadette"? Big one
But you would've done the exact same thing, and you know it
I never would've undermined a coworker
What? Oh, please Wh-What about that guy Eric,
who you told it was "Bring Your Cat to Work Day"
when you knew your boss had asthma?
That was just a hilarious prank
that ended with me getting a corner office
All I'm saying is
before you attack Ruchi, maybe you should
take a long hard look in the mirror,
because you know what you'll see--
apart from radiant skin and luxuriously thick hair?
Hypocrisy!
It is thick
So what do you think? Can you make it work?
Uh, I just need to use the cross section
to calculate the probability of the interaction
Can we help?
Yes
Why don't you run get me a can of Pringles
Leonard, I was--
What's Kripke doing here?
Oh, he's just helping us develop a better, more efficient
neutrino comm system that we're gonna pitch to the military,
making yours obsolete
Yeah, Leonard thought of it
It's genius Oh, thanks
You see, instead of using liquid helium
Good God, man, shut up! Right, sorry
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You didn't tell me we were doing this
just to stick it to Sheldon
Oh, well
I messing with you This sundae just got a cherry on top!
Fine Good luck to you
The military is already interested in my system,
and my math is worked out
His still has a big gap in it
Where?
There
- - Can I ask you a question? Mm?
Does a drug still count as an antidepressant
if its number one side effect is uncontrollable weeping?
I don't know I always feel better after a good cry
I've been trying to ask Bernadette,
but she's not answering any of my texts
Yeah, uh, listen, I think she might be
a little threatened by you, you know,
because you can tie your own shoes and laugh without peeing
Did she say something to you?
No
I mean, well, kind of
But it's okay She's just hormonal
And, you know, don't worry, I stood up for you
I don't need you to stand up for me
You're not my boyfriend
Look, I care about you,
and you can say that this doesn't mean anything,
but the truth is we're in a relationship, okay?
And you're gonna have to figure out some way to deal with it
I can't believe she dumped me
This is tough for me, 'cause I can
Sorry things worked out like that
Because I'm in pain or because you don't have a spy anymore?
Let's just leave it at "I'm sorry"
You're already sad
Based on Kripke's calculations,
I think this is gonna work
Maybe we should pitch it to Colonel Williams today
Why limit ourselves to the US military?
I bet there's a lot of other places we could take this
Without committing criminal espionage?
You know, it's easy to shoot an idea down, Leonard
Well, I suppose congratulations are in order
You set out to destroy me, and you achieved your goal
What are you talking about?
The military canceled my project,
because they're going with yours
That's impossible We haven't even pitched it yet
Well, Colonel Williams said another team at Caltech
came up with a more efficient neutrino comm system
Damn it!
Excuse us
Kripke
What's up, fellas?
Did you screw us over?
Ooh, I can't tell you that
It's classified
Why did you tell Barry Kripke your idea?
This is all your fault
No, it's your fault
If you would've come to us in the beginning,
none of this would've happened
Well, if it helps, you all behaved terribly
and you deserve what you got
Well, that doesn't help at all
You know, sometimes your social skills are very poor
Can't believe we let Kripke use us like that
You know, maybe you're all more like the guy
who didn't invent the electric car
and less like the guy who didn't invent the lightbulb
She's right Maybe we're all a bunch of Teslas after all
Didn't Tesla die penniless, forgotten and insane?
You may have a point about her social skills
He wasn't insane
He did fall in love with a pigeon
Well, if we're gonna call Tesla crazy
for loving something small and unappealing,
might as well put Penny in a padded cell right now

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Why are they making four more Avatar movies?
It's not like the first one is even that good
What are you talking about? You love that movie
You even went as Avatar for Halloween
I remember That was not a lot of clothes
Hey, guys
- Hey - Hey
I'm, uh, I'm running a special today, uh,
buy something, keep having a comic book store to come to
This is awkward
I was actually gonna return this
What's wrong with it?
I-I finished it
Speaking of something I find interesting,
did anyone read that article about Bitcoin I sent you?
Yeah, I can't believe a single Bitcoin
is worth about $5,000 now
Wait, didn't we mine some a few years ago?
It was seven years ago
Oh, yeah, I remember that
Really? All I can remember from seven years ago
is I couldn't get Kesha's "Tik Tok" out of my head
This was a good idea
It's been a long time since we've had girls' night
Yeah, it's so nice to have a relaxing evening
at home doing nothing
Yeah, really breaks up the other 30 days
I've spent on bed rest doing nothing
Well, tonight we're gonna make you forget all that
You're gonna make me forget I've been stuck in bed
while a baby uses my bladder as a kickball?
(knocking)
Hey, you had unprotected sex with Howard
You deserve to be miserable
Hey, I need some fashion advice
Really? From me? I would love to
Actually, Leonard told me Penny was over here?
Hey, what's going on? You got a date?
I, uh, do have a date with science
Oh, what's science wearing?
The Griffith Observatory is looking for an astrophysicist
to consult, and I have an interview tomorrow
Oh, I love the observatory
They tell you your weight on all the different planets
Yeah It's always bikini season on Venus
I think you'd be great at that
Don't you agree, Bernadette?
Huh? I'm listening I'm listening
I'm not watching The Crown 
I just want to make a good first impression,
and thought maybe you could help me pick out an outfit?
Of course Let's see what you got
Yeah, you just need to pick something
that-that you feel confident in
I'm sorry I left my magic clothes at home
I'm sure these two options will be f
So you-you have other clothes at home?
Uh, it doesn't matter
They're talking to a bunch of people
I probably won't get it anyway
Well, don't say that
Yeah, you have to believe in yourself
You know, before I came to America,
I was filled with confidence
What happened to me?
Hey, is that Raj there at girls' night?
Well, hey Hey, Howard
Just remember, if you fall asleep first,
they're gonna freeze your bra
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
Want to grab some lunch?
You know what? I don't think so
Oh, let me guess, you're not eating
because the mean girls circled your chubby bits in marker?
No That, that right there
That's the reason You're always making fun of me
Those are just jokes
It's my way of saying that we're friends,
and it wouldn't hurt you to drop a few
15 years of constant ridicule
I-I think our relationship has become toxic
What are you saying?
I think you and I need to spend some time away from each other
Look, I
I can see you're upset, but
I'm gonna need some ground rules
While we're apart, can I see other needy Indian men?
Get out!
Oh, Stuart, two questions:
Do you have the new Aquaman,
and do you mind if I use your back room to smoke some meat?
Well, since it's you asking,
I'm gonna guess that's not a euphemism
Why are you smoking meat?
And why are you reading Aquaman?
I am trying to make Amy a historically accurate
Little House on the Prairie dinner for her birthday, and
I want to be able to say I was reading it before it was cool
Wow, well, that's actually really sweet
The dinner thing The Aquaman thing's dumb
Eh
Isn't Halley's birthday the same as Amy's?
Yeah, but we're not doing anything big 'cause she's one,
Bernadette's on bed rest, and I'm lazy
Hey, guys
Hello Hey
Howard
Raj
Excuse me
Really? Is this still happening?
I'm willing to make up, but someone's being a baby
Ooh! I do love a riddle Oh, let me see
See, my first guess would be Halley,
but that'd be strange to accuse her of being a baby
'cause she is a baby Um
I suppose it could be Stuart;
his head does have a certain milky scent
Although
I-It's me, Sheldon He-He's calling me a baby
No, I don't know I saw Leonard put his keys in his mouth today
You're a grown man; act like it
Big talk coming from a guy holding an Archie comic book
Hey, werewolf Jughead is not your dad's Jughead
Come on, you guys have been friends forever Quit fighting
I have an extra ticket
to the opening of The Last Jedi tonight
It was gonna be Howard's, but you can have it
You two had a good run
Hey, can you do me a favor?
Can we try to avoid talking to our friends tonight
about our wedding plans?
I'll do you one better
I'll avoid talking to our friends entirely
and play on my phone
It's just, I haven't picked a maid of honor yet,
and I'm having trouble deciding between Penny and Bernadette
Ah, understandable
They are quite similar--
both blonde former waitresses who married beneath them
Penny is my best friend,
but I was Bernadette's maid of honor,
and I think she kind of expects it
So if anyone brings it up tonight,
just maybe you can help me change the subject
How about this?
I dominate the conversation so hard,
no one has a chance to get a word in edgewise
I don't know
They might see that coming
What if we have a code word?
Ooh, now you're speaking my catamaran
That's my code word for language
Okay, fine, catamaran
That's our code word
No, that's my code word Get your own
Okay Uh, pretzels
You hear me say pretzels, you change the subject
Rhinos are my least favorite animals at the zoo
What?
Oh, I'm sorry I thought we started
Hey, just-just hold the gate still while I screw it in
You know, I don't know how I feel
about all this baby-proofing
If Halley can't teach herself to walk down the stairs,
then maybe that's nature's way of saying
the Wolowitz line ends here
That's funny I always thought
Howard was nature's way of saying
the Wolowitz line ends here
Me, too, but life does find a way!
Hey, Halley can't reach the liquor cabinet
Why did you baby-proof it?
How did you know we did?
Fair point
LEONARD: Bernadette still going stir-crazy?
Oh, a little
Two months of bed rest-- it's kind of rough
Really? That sounds great How do I get that?
You'd either have to break your hip or let Howard knock you up
Now, either way, you'll get flowers the next morning
She's actually been keeping herself busy
doing wedding research for you
Oh, she-she doesn't have to do that
She wants to After all, you were her maid of honor
Sheldon, tell your funny story about pretzels
Oh, right Yeah, oh, yeah
Did you know that we've been thinking
of having pretzels at our wedding? Hmm?
No, no No, no, no, no, no I'm sorry
No, rhinos We're having rhinos at our wedding
No! (stammers) I got to go
I'm gonna need some help
Someone baby-proofed the front door
Hey! Look what I got everybody
Newspapers? Did you find a portal back to the 1990s?
No If he had that, he'd be trying to prevent NSYNC
from breaking up
Oh, please I'm glad they broke up
Otherwise, Justin would never have brought sexy back
One thing you can't get on an iPad,
the smell of ink and paper
One more reason iPads are better
They reviewed my planetarium show
Yeah It's on page three of the Arts and Leisure section
Oh, look, they still have Far Side
Oh, I don't get that one
Oh, he's pushing when he should be pulling
Hmm I don't think he belongs in that gifted school, then
What are you doing? Making a boat
When I was a kid, my dad showed me how
Boy, you'll do anything to avoid reading
Guys, it's under Things to do this weekend
I can't find it What does it say?
That it's a thing to do this weekend
That's great, Raj Congratulations
You know, while we're bragging,
The Journal of Prosthetic Medicine 
just wrote up the project that Howard and I are working on
Well, you didn't tell me that
Oh, it just came out It's just a little blurb
Oh, well, good for you
You know, Bert and I have started isolating zircons
from meteorites for our dark matter search
Oh Well, how nice
Everyone's doing impressive work
What have you been working on these days?
Whoa, whoa Where'd that come from?
Where did what come from?
I try to be supportive,
and you break out the hot lights and the rubber hose
I just asked what you've been working on
Oh, my God, let it go
Do you believe this guy?
I did it!
See? It's a it's a boat
It's also a hat
Space is the mirror of the soul
Are we looking beyond, or are we looking within?
I'm looking at my shoes
This is making me a little motion sick
When we gaze out at the immensities of space,
we understand them because there are immensities
within us as well
I'm Dr Rajesh Koothrappali,
and thank you for taking a walk with me
through the stars
That pause gets longer every show
I believe
you're right
Hey
Can I get a picture with you?
Absolutely
And if you post it on social media,
I suggest the hashtag "Koothra-poet"
Thank you The show was great
Well, I can't take all the credit
I have pretty good co-stars
The stars
Do you say that to everyone?
Only to beautiful women
And okay women
Okay
Uh, just to clarify: you're the first kind
Okay
Thanks for coming
What did you handsome gentlemen think of the show?
Uh, you can turn it off now
It's sweet of you to say, but I don't think I can
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
So, Leonard, tell everyone your news
Oh, uh, I am starting a book
That would be big news from Penny,
but you've read a book before
He means he's writing a book
I do It's something I've been thinking about for a long time
Yeah It's about a brilliant physicist
who solves crimes using science
Oh, Leonard
It's not about you!
Oh, boy What?
They cast the new Professor Proton
Is it Sheldon? Not exactly
Wheaton!
It's Wil Wheaton
Hey, what are you doing?
I thought we were having dinner at Leonard and Penny's
Oh, no
No, they're watching the new Professor Proton 
I-I can't keep Wil Wheaton off the Internet,
but I can keep him off my retinas
So, you're just gonna sit here by yourself and do nothing?
Of course not
I'm going to write mean comments about Wil's show online
Well, you can't criticize something you haven't seen
I'm sorry, are you familiar with the Internet?
Well, what if I watch it with you?
Maybe I won't like it and we can complain about it together
Get your own thing to complain about
Oh, trust me, I've got one
Look, at least if you watch it,
maybe you can find more specific things to criticize
Oh, that is a good point
Criticisms are more hurtful when they're specific
Howie? Howie, wake up
It's time
Oh Did your water break?
No
Are you feeling any contractions?
No
Wait Well, where are you going?
To the hospital
Today's my due date, and this crap needs to end now
Honey, babies don't always come on their due date
Halley was two weeks late
But this baby's a boy
They don't take as long to get ready
What are you doing?
I'm making the situation better with humor
Are you?
Would you rather me make it better with magic?
- Go back to sleep - Ta-da!
You know, I hear that sex can induce labor
Anything for my family
Oh, my God, I can't believe how big Halley's getting
Yeah-- where's Howard?
He's changing Michael
A-All done You know, fun fact,
did you know baby boys can pee straight up?
Grown-up boys, too
Why would we high-five that?
So how are you guys?
Really good
Except for when we went grocery shopping,
and the checkout lady asked when I was due
But you handled it well
Well, if you guys need help, I'd be happy to come over
Oh, thanks, but we're really trying to enjoy this family time
before we both go back to work
Okay, well, we all miss you
You guys, too Bye
Ah
Boy, seeing them all together like that
has got my biological clock ticking like crazy
Yeah, I don't think men have
I do
- Hi - Hello
Hey, guys Hey
Good news, we have save the date cards
Oh
Huh, didn't go with my calligrapher Interesting
What is this picture?
Oh, it's an MRI of our brains photoshopped
to look like they're kissing
Is it too sexy?
It's too something
Guys, May 12, that's exciting
I know Do you guys have
a location yet? 'Cause you don't have a lot of time
Hey, it took us nine months to pick a date,
and a week to decide if brains can have lips on them,
so get in the boat and row
But why do they still call Batman using the Bat-Signal?
Wouldn't it just be, like, easier to text him?
The Bat-Signal isn't just to alert Batman,
it's also to strike fear in the hearts of his enemies
and let them know he's coming
Sort of like Sheldon's knock
Comparing me to Batman? I'll take it
If we don't do anything,
how long do you think they'll talk about Batman?
Well, I've know them for 11 years, so 11 years
I believe they do text him
The-the Bat-Signal is linked to his phone via Bluetooth
Has that been in the comics?
No, it's just what I believe
All right, I'm putting a stop to this
If you knew how, why'd you wait 11 years?
Hey, guys, guess what?
Today at work, I found out I am going to meet Bill Gates
Sorry, Leonard, you and Penny had a good run
I'm not leaving him for Bill Gates
You sure? I-I bet his Internet's really fast
How did this happen?
Well, his foundation is looking to partner
with a pharmaceutical company to help develop affordable vaccines
so they asked me to show him around
That's great When's he coming?
Uh, he gets in on Sunday, and Monday morning,
I'm gonna give him a tour of the labs and offices
Oh He gets in on Sunday, April first?
Nice try, Penny
What're you talking about?
April Fools' Day
This is another one of your classic pranks
you try to pull on me every year
Literally never pulled a prank on you
Oh, really? What about last year,
when you sent me that e-mail with the photo attached,
but you didn't attach a photo
That was a mistake
Messing with me? Yes, it was
And this year,
I am not falling for it
Sheldon, I swear No what are you doing?
Oh, you're right He's not coming April fools
You know what they say,
fool me "N" times,
where "N" equals the amount of times you've already fooled me,
shame on you
Fool me "N" plus one times, shame on me
Why are you wearing a Band-Aid?
Halley bit me
(laughs) You got beaten up by a girl
Hey, that's sexist
You're right
(laughs) You got beaten up by a baby 
- Hi - Hey - Hey
What you got there? Oh, I grabbed a sandwich
at the food truck out front
Wait, n-now, hold on
Tonight is Friday,
and I believe you know what that means
That my fun, young life took a drastic turn somewhere?
No
But yeah
No, that means it's Chinese food night
Yeah, and you have Chinese food So eat it
But I can smell your pastrami
And we can all hear your complaining,
so no one's happy
It does smell good
Oh, it is I had one the other day
(stammers) What is happening?
Everybody's supposed to be eating Chinese food
Well, actually, I believe the Chinese
may have invented the sandwich
Their dish rou jia mo literally means
meat between bread
So, it looks like all of us, including Penny,
are eating Chinese food
Except for you, Sheldon You're eating crow
I'm sorry, I think you're forgetting
that the sandwich was invented
by John Montagu, the Earl of Sandwich
Oh The truck's called Pearl of Sandwich
Now I get it
All right, that smells too good I got to get one of those
And I think you're forgetting that there are written documents
of meat between bread being eaten in China
during the Tang dynasty
You know what, I'll go with you
And then maybe we just go home
I think you're defining bread very loosely
If we go down that road, where does it end?
Well, I would say when we go to bed,
but you talk in your sleep
I don't want to get into this with you right now
We'll talk about this when I'm asleep
I don't want to talk about it when you're asleep
How come we can't talk about it now?
Well, because I'm eating now
Fine How's your moo shu?
You know what? It's great
Wait, look at that
Hmm Well, maybe the Chinese did invent the sandwich
I guess you were right
Too bad no one's around to hear it
If Bruce Banner's driving a rental car
and turns into the Hulk, do you think he's covered,
or does he need to add the Hulk as an additional driver?
You really need a girlfriend
Mailman's here!
Aw Remember when he used to get that excited to see us?
Do you have any mail for Dr Sheldon Cooper?
I do, but I can't hand it right to you--
I have to put it in the box
And that is what separates the US Postal Service
from those hippies at FedEx
Oh, goody!
What is so exciting?
It's a letter from Dr Wolcott
We've been corresponding about my string theory research
Wait Robert Wolcott? Like Wolcott's Theorem Wolcott?
The very same
Didn't he go crazy
and cut off all contact with people?
Yeah, he was driven mad by a friend
who kept wanting to talk about the Hulk's car insurance!
Oh He's invited me to his cabin for the weekend,
to discuss a breakthrough he's had
- His cabin? - Yes He lives off the grid,
up in the mountains
So you're gonna go to the middle of nowhere
and spend the weekend with a crazy man you've never met?
Yes Why?
No reason Have fun
What are you doing?
Pigeon check for Sheldon
North side's all clear!
Great Let's look at some planets!
Hey, why'd you lug your telescope all the way over here?
Leonard has one in our apartment
Yeah, I'm gonna use Leonard's
Might as well hold my hand up like this and squint
I don't know It seemed pretty good
You know, once when the cable went out,
I watched an entire episode of The Bachelor 
on a TV across the street
This one's more of a professional model
So was the girl he picked!
This baby's got a ten-inch diameter with f/10 ACF optics
And tonight
Mercury is at its highest elongation
It makes far-away things seem close, and Mercury is a planet
I know Mercury is a planet
But the-the other thing was helpful
Oh Look at that
- Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store! - What did he say?
Uh, "Next time you're in Pasadena,
"check out The Comic Center
"Great vibe, old school,
the owner really knows his stuff"
Isn't that amazing?
Well, uh, it's no Sandman, but I guess we can't expect
everything he writes to be a masterpiece
When was he in your store?
I have no idea I think I would remember that
Obviously, vibranium is the most powerful metal in comics
What, more powerful than adamantium?
He's right
Wolverine's claws, Ultron's outer shell
Need I go on?
You don't need to, but you probably will
What about Wonder Woman's bracelets?
Good point
Strong as a metal and fierce as a fashion choice
You know,
Thor's hammer's pretty powerful,
and in the comics, it's made out of enchanted uru
Uh, yeah, I think it's the enchantment
that's powerful, not the uru,
but, uh, thanks for playing
Oh, man, I can't believe Neil Gaiman came in,
and we weren't even there
What-what are you doing?
The light is red so I came to a stop
You're in a stolen cop car with a dead hooker in the trunk
You don't have to obey traffic laws
I know I don't have to
The fun is choosing to
Hey Missed you guys at the faculty mixer
Ah, you should have been there; dessert was bananas
Sorry, that was misleading The dessert was pie,
but the pie was bananas
Actually, the pie was cherry,
but the taste of the pie was bananas
Those mixers are such a waste of university money
If they spent less money
on frivolous nonsense and more money on science,
we'd all be better off
You're a theoretical physicist
What more do you need than an office and a whiteboard?
Someday, my new formulas on entropy decrease
due to quantum decoherence will need to be tested
and that will require funding
Your theories are pretty abstract
I wouldn't even know how to
design an experiment to prove them
Says the experimental physicist
Well, I know a place the university can make some cuts
Bye, Leonard
One second, one second
He's got a point
In order to corroborate your string theory research,
you'd have to create a black hole
Wouldn't that destroy the Earth?
Perhaps, but we'd all go to the grave knowing I was right
I guess you could create
a contained microscopic black hole
Huh Interesting
Welcome back, Leonard
Sorry, you're out
What did I do?
Exactly
That's not right
That's so unreasonable
Yeah, well, if you're going to be like this,
then I don't want to talk to you right now, either
Okay I love you Bye
Amazon customer support?
No, my mother
Guess who she's insisting we invite to our wedding
Jesus?
If only
My brother
Wait a minute You didn't invite your brother
to your own wedding?
He tormented me my whole childhood
I don't think I should reward
that type of behavior
with a slice of wedding cake in the shape
of the Millennium Falcon
Try again
A slice of wedding cake in the shape of a cake
Look, he may have been mean to you when you were kids,
but you're both grown men now
That's right I'm a grown-up,
and if I don't want to invite him to my wedding, then I won't
Okay
Except I have to 'cause my mommy's making me
All right, Saturday is the big day
A lot of people thought this would never come
I may have been one of those people
I may have been one of those people
Wait, wait, are we talking about the wedding?
Yes
Oh, yeah, I was definitely one of those people
And yet, here we are
Now, we got a lot of family coming in tomorrow
I'm gonna need everyone's help
Think of this as one of your comic book movies
There's a bunch of superheroes, each with a different task
Oh, like the new Avengers
Which one was that?
The one you slept through last weekend
Oh, that was a good nap
I-I think it's more like, uh, like Lord of the Rings,
and you're the Fellowship
Uh, someone's got to go to Gondor,
someone's got to go to Mordor,
someone's got to hold off the demon of shadow and flame
You mean the Balrog?
I mean my mother
That is a perfect metaphor, Amy
Thank you
Because it also involves a ring
that binds me in servitude forever
Aw, he said forever
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
Can you believe our little lamb is finally getting married?
He can't believe it
And neither can I
Hi, Dad How you doing?
Then by the power vested in me
by EvenYouCanPerformWeddingscom
I now pronounce you husband and wife
You may kiss the bride
Good morning, wife
Good morning, husband
I can't believe we're actually married
It's official According to tradition,
we should hang the bedsheets outside
so the villagers can see that we consummated
I don't think that that's appropriate,
considering where we're starting our honeymoon
Well, I suppose you're right
Although, when you think about it,
Lego is the perfect metaphor for marital congress
Two pieces that interlock with a satisfying snap
Oh, that's the sound you were making
Oh, I almost forgot
While you were sleeping, I ordered room service
Really?
Voilà!
You thought it was going to be food, didn't you?
But I think, by the end of the honeymoon,
we really started to feel like a married couple
But the good kind, like on TV,
not like my parents - Yeah
You're not a real married couple until you can pee
with the door open and she's okay with it
I told you, I'm not okay with it
She loves it
So, we got everybody gifts
Aw
Did you forget about us
until you were at the airport?
No
We forgot about you until we were on the plane
Luckily, there was Wi-Fi,
and I have Amazon Prime
I heart New York
Aw, the baby's gonna love throwing up on this
Look, it doesn't have to just be New York
That's the beauty of it
Uh, the initials "NY" can stand for anything you like
For instance, I understand that there is
an elderly rock-and-roll musician named Neil Young
Perhaps you heart him
Or if not him, Egyptian table tennis silver medalist
Noha Yossry
Or Nana Yamaguchi,
the Japanese voice actress
who starred in Sally the Witch 
Did you just Google the initials "NY"?
I had Wi-Fi and a long plane flight
Draw your own conclusions
Well, guys, that was very, very thoughtful of you I
Did you get me a double XL?
- I told you - You were right, dear
So, Penny, we were talking to our neighbors,
and they're thinking of moving and selling their house
Really? Why?
Something about babies crying
and keeping them up all night; it's not important
You guys should totally take a look at it
Then we could be neighbors
Hey Wait a minute, what about us?
I mean, we're married now
Maybe we want to buy the house next door
Well, Amy, we can't move
I'd have to change all the tags in my underwear
You can buy new ones
What-- new house, new underwear What am I,
in the Witness Protection Program?
Okay Guys, so what do you think?
Well, I don't know, w-we're pretty happy here
Yeah Plus, if we moved, we'd probably just get
a loft downtown
Really? I always figured we'd get a place with a yard
Oh, sure, yeah, that makes sense,
so you could shoot hoops and mow the lawn?
How are you two married?
You were there I wore her down
He did
You guys should've talked about all this stuff
while you were dating
I mean, me and Anu already know so much about each other
Wait, I forget, is Anu your waxer?
Uh, no, that's Annette
Anu is the woman my father fixed me up with
We're going on our first date tomorrow
Which reminds me, I need to see Annette
You're really letting your father pick out a wife?
Why not?
Arranged marriages have been working for thousands of years
Anu and I come from similar backgrounds,
our families get along and we each
filled out questionnaires, so we know we're not wasting our time
with someone who's not compatible
Oh, that sounds so dry and clinical
You lucky duck
I just don't think you can truly know someone
until you've spent a lot of time with them
Really? What's Penny's dream vacation?
Uh, Malibu beach house
That's Barbie's dream vacation
Maybe you should send us that questionnaire
Hey, whatcha doing?
Improving our wedding photos
Oh, that's nice
Wait, I'm still in them, right?
Of course And not only you
I've added some guests who couldn't be there
Who's that next to my father?
The Wright brothers
And why are they at our wedding?
Orville, because I admire him;
Wilbur, because he was Orville's plus-one
Oh
You got an e-mail from someone named Tam
Tam? What does he want?
Uh
looks like he's coming to give his son a tour of Caltech
He's hoping you guys can meet up
He would like that, wouldn't he?
Well, that is the gist of the e-mail
Who's Tam?
He was my best friend
in the whole world growing up
Really? Why have I never heard you mention him before?
Oh, of course I have I'm sure I've mentioned him,
like, five times this week
I don't think you have
Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam! There, it's only Thursday
I didn't just drink the crazy milk, I bought the crazy cow
Recently, 12 new moons
were discovered orbiting Jupiter,
bringing the total up to 79
As a middle child myself, I'd like to extend
my sympathies to moons two through 78
Your grandpa will never learn your name
I'd like to thank you for joining me on this journey
through the stars
If you enjoyed this lecture,
please come back Thursday for the exact same one
Do I look like I just woke up?
No
Great I'm gonna go say hey to Raj
What were you guys giggling about?
They were passing notes to each other
Oh-ho, love notes?
If you love math
And we do
It's for our super-asymmetry theory
Yeah, Amy and I have been having so much fun
collaborating together
Well, you know what they say, you never collaborate
as much as your first year of marriage
- Hey, great show - Thanks
Oh, Howard, uh, this is Andrea
She's the director of the planetarium
Hi
Nice to meet you I'm Howard Wolowitz
Engineer, husband, father
astronaut
Really? You're an astronaut?
Well, I don't like to brag
Hmm, yeah, but somehow, you manage
Raj, you should have Howard join you for one of your shows
Oh, that might be fun
But-- it might be, but with two small children at home
and a full-time job, I'm sure you're too busy
No, I could find the time
Well, you don't have to decide right now
It's okay, I
He can't do it
Hey, hurry up, guys
The gift shop's closing, and Amy said
I can get one big thing or two little things
Hey, did you guys know this year's the 40th anniversary
of Halloween? - Oh, nonsense
Halloween traditions
of date back to the Celtic festival of Samhain
Although our current Halloween customs
come from the evening before All Hallows' Day--
All Hallows' Eve-- thus, Halloween
I meant the movie Halloween 
Oh
Well, that's not interesting at all
Did you know the Michael Myers mask from the film
was actually a Captain Kirk mask turned inside out?
Okay, now it's interesting
Are you guys all dressing up for work?
Of course I mean, how often
do you get to wear costumes to work?
Says the man with a giant belt buckle and a dickey
Hey, this is not a costume It's a choice It's a style
It's a tragedy
Bernadette, why don't we get to dress up at work?
We used to, but a couple guys in the infectious disease lab
went as zombies and it triggered a quarantine
The CDC was so mad
Hey, if you really want to dress up, we could throw a party
Oh, that would be fun
You know, I used to throw Halloween parties all the time
when I moved into the building
All the time? I only remember being invited to one
Please don't make this awkward for me
Okay, so, Friday night--
Halloween party here - Okay
Great Can't wait
What are you going as?
I don't want to ruin the surprise
You'll see it at work Just a warning:
it's pretty scary
- Is it a bird? - No
- Is it a dog? - No
Oh, I think I'll be fine, then
Hello
Hello
I see you are dressed as Doc Brown
from Back to the Future 
May I assume that Amy is going as his wife, Clara Clayton,
from Back to the Future Part III? 
She is
Did you do something different to your hair?
Yes
Looking good
Oh, this is amazing
I wish I had a playhouse like this when I was a kid
Really? You never had a playhouse?
No I mean, my dad did buy the house next door
for us to play in
I'm gonna hook up the garden hose, so it has running water
Why does it need running water?
Same reason it's got electricity:
Bernadette and I both work, and we're overcompensating
This reminds me of a traditional Amish barn raising
With everyone pitching in
How exactly are you pitching in?
I don't hear anyone else giving facts
about traditional Amish barn raising
The rest of us are pitching in with hammers and nails
Well, facts are my nails, and my voice is the hammer
which pounds them through the wood of your skull
Well, that is how it feels
Hey, uh, can you pass me that drill?
Yeah, fun fact about Amish barn raising--
they don't use any power tools
- Amy, make him stop - No
If he tires himself out now, he'll sleep better tonight
Hey, Howie, can you give me a hand?
I need to get some work done,
and the kids are climbing all over me
You know what? I'll watch them
- You sure? - But I was just about to tell everyone
why they're called Pennsylvania Dutch
when they really hail from Germany
Yep
Thanks
So, what do you think? Pretty cool, huh?
And when our kids outgrow it,
we can Airbnb it to other people's babies
Funny
You all right?
Sorry, I haven't had a second to myself
So let me just go back inside, finish my report,
brush my teeth, change out of my pajamas, make a sandwich,
and then I'll come out here and laugh at your joke
Ooh As long as you're making sandwiches
You can laugh at that one later, too
All right, I've kept you in suspense long enough
"Dutch" is a bastardization of the word "Deutsch,"
meaning German
What's German for "annoying"?
Nervig Why do you ask?
Hey, you guys have any plans for Valentine's Day?
Three months from now? No
- What? No? - I mean,
secret romantic plans that would be ruined if I told you
Oh
What's going on, Raj?
Well, how would you guys feel
about going to India for my wedding?
Oh, that's so exciting!
Penny, you will never guess what I have planned
for Valentine's Day - Uh-huh
Can I feed peanuts to the elephants at your wedding?
- That is such a stereotype! - There won't be any elephants?
Of course there'll be elephants
It's a stereotype that you feed them peanuts
Are you really gonna plan a wedding in three months?
Yeah, well, her family's doing most of the work
They're amazing We talk all the time
Why?
Because we're about to get married
and they're gonna be my family
Amy and I are married, and I never talk to her family
Really? My parents love Leonard
Yeah And my mom loves Penny, which is weird,
because I never knew she could love
And my dad has grown to really
like Howard
Yeah, there's a nice coolness between us
Hey, guys, before Anu gets here,
can I talk about the seating situation?
I really don't want her to sit on the floor
Oh No problem Bernadette, floor
- Hey! - Yeah, you can't make my wife
sit on the floor - Fine
Howard, floor
Fine, I'll sit on the floor
Thank you, Penny And, Leonard,
I was kind of hoping I could sit next to Anu
So now I have to sit on the floor? It's my house
Why can't Sheldon sit on the floor?
That might be the dumbest thing you've ever said
Guys, guys,
there's a simple solution
I am not breaking up with her
All right Let's keep thinking
Hey, everybody, it's Anu
Hi
Hi! Welcome!
Sheldon, do you want to put the tables after each section
or in an appendix at the end?
You know what? We wrote this paper together
I think we should decide together
that they go in an appendix at the end
How about that? There is an "I" in "team"
- Look at what we made - I know
It really is the best of both of us
It's got my math and your sassy takedown
of the fundamental nature of symmetry
It's got my bottomless intellectual curiosity
and your petulant refusal
to spell "gray" with an "a" like an American
You realize we still have a lot of work to do
before we can publish
Perhaps we should divide and conquer
Now, you track down all the citations
and properly note them in our bibliography,
and I will roll up my sleeves
and decide what font we want to use
Sheldon, there are hundreds of citations to track down
And thousands of fonts, but you don't hear me complaining
I am not gonna spend weeks
in a library looking up old papers
Can't we hire a grad student to do it?
Yeah, a grad student?
I am not trusting our unpublished paper
to some millennial
They'll put unicorn emojis on it
and then post it on social media
Why would they do that?
Economic anxiety, too much avocado toast, who cares?
Look, the point is, we can't afford to have this paper leaked
before we're ready to publish
That's how you kiss the Nobel Prize good-bye
instead of hello as I intend to do
I assume you mean metaphorically
Absolutely not If the King of Sweden hands me a medal,
I intend to smear it with Purell and then kiss it
But what if we ask one of our friends to help us out?
How about Leonard?
Gee, I don't know Can we trust him?
He's your best friend in the whole world
Yes, but he's always struck me
as the guy in the plane crash
who doesn't wait until you're all the way dead to eat you
I think you can trust him
Oh, Amy, you never lose that childlike innocence
Leonard, I need to tell you something
I'm having an affair
Okay
You have to swear not to tell anybody
Okay
You are the only one who knows
Uh, well, you and Rita, the cafeteria lady
who has been giving me more than Tater Tots
Hey, Sheldon
Not a word
What did he want?
Oh, nothing He just concocted some stupid test
to see if I can keep a secret
Ooh, what's the secret?
I'm not gonna tell you that
The test is stupid, but I still want to pass
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
Actually, I-I need to talk to both of you about your paper
Oh, right, how are the citations coming?
Um
We came a-across a-a Russian paper
that seems to disprove super-asymmetry
Okay, Sheldon and Amy are still pretty upset
about their theory being disproved
So we have made a list of subjects
for everyone to avoid
- Symmetry - Asymmetry
Uh, SimCity-- 
sounds too much like symmetry
That also applies
to The Simpsons, Simba from The Lion King, 
and cymbals
Russia or Russian in any context
The country, the dressing, the roulette
Uh, also no talk of Rocky IV 
Why Rocky IV? 
Because he fights a Russian
I'm sorry about her
We should just try and avoid anything that makes them think
of their project or science
or Nobel Prizes or successes or failures
- Hi - Hi!
Hey, guys Hey-a!
What are you guys doing?
Nothing
Nothing?
Like what my career has come to? Thanks a lot
Nice going
Champagne, a champagne,
a champagne with a packet of Splenda in it
- You know what I call this drink? - A waste of champagne?
No A Dr Cooper
Because
He's also sweet and bubbly
All right
A a toast to Sheldon and Amy
and the publication of your super-asymmetry paper
We are so proud of you guys
- Cheers - Thanks - Yay Boom
Ooh! That is PhD-licious
So, have you guys gotten any feedback yet?
Well, there are some comments online,
but we haven't read them We decided we don't care
what people say about our work
Good for you
People online can be so mean
I posted a picture of myself on Instagram,
and some jerk said I looked so skinny I might disappear
And yet, somehow she soldiers on
Mm
Although, Amy and I did give the world a gift
It would be nice to read some of the thank-you notes
I'm surprised you're interested in some stranger's opinion
Well, as I always say, a stranger's just a friend
who hasn't complimented me yet
Okay
- I'll read them - If any of them
accuse you of being too pretty, Penny can help you through it
Okay, here's one from Dr Saltzberg at UCLA
Wait, no, stop I don't want to know What if he's mean?
Well, what if he's complimentary?
I want to know
Okay He says
- I don't want to know - All right, just
let me see it
Okay, this is this is really positive
Wow, it's,
like, really positive
He says it might be the discovery of the decade
He's right They love it!
This is so exciting
Oh, this may be the Dr Cooper talking,
but pour me another Dr Cooper
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
So I told my mom she just needed to back off
This is our wedding, and if anyone's gonna
design the floral arrangements, it's going to be my man
Thank you
I mean, I-I'm not trying to be a Groomzilla,
but this is my specialty
Everything okay?
Yeah, it's just Anu's doorbell camera
I helped her install it
You can't look at it That's spying
Who the hell is this guy?
Ooh, let me see
So you're still talking to your ex-boyfriend?
Yes, and I'm not gonna apologize for that
And you need to delete that app from your phone
Because you're hiding something from me?
No, because you should trust me!
How can I trust you?! I barely even know you!
Then what are we doing?
I don't know
- Oh! - Aah,
sad man!
This is so great
Why don't we do it more often?
Because you have two kids,
I have Sheldon,
and Penny's apparently in the gym all the time,
'cause damn, look at her!
Yeah, so impressive how you manage
to bounce back after having no babies
Ah, another reason why we don't do this more often
You've come to a giant metal door
I check the door for traps
There are no traps
I use my wizard eye
to see what's on the other side of the door
Hey, that's sort of like how you used a doorbell camera
to spy on your fiancée
No, it's nothing like that
Your wizard eye reveals a monster
- Oh Is it alone and unloved? - I guess
I open the door and say, "Hey, Raj"
I have a bottle of champagne for you
Oh, we didn't order this
It's from the gentleman at the end of the bar
Oh Well, if we drink it, does that mean
we're making a promise?
'Cause I am happily married, although I will watch
We're not gonna do anything
Really? So all that work's for Leonard?
Why don't you just call her? I'm sure
you guys can work this out
I don't want to talk about it Let's just play
Okay, the cyclops tells you
that the enchantress you seek is staying
at the Inn of the Dwarven Lords
Really? An inn?
Anu is a concierge at a hotel
That's a little insensitive,
don't you think?
I hadn't noticed that before you mentioned it
Well, now that I've mentioned it, how do you feel?
Bad
Shame on you
- Hey, ladies - Zack!
Hi You guys know Zack
- Yeah - Of course
Did-did you send this over?
I did I asked for the most expensive one they have
They said it was $200,
and I said I want a more expensive one
And then, they said it was $300
But it-it was the same
Don't
Thank you, but you shouldn't have spent so much
Nah
It's cool I sold my company for a boatload of money
And then I bought a boat
Then I got married
Guess where
On your boat?
No, but that would've been awesome!
Well, congratulations
Hey, you and Leonard
should come over and have dinner with us on our boat
Yeah, that would be so nice
Leonard was just saying how he was hoping to have dinner
with one of your ex-boyfriends on his expensive boat
- Well, then this worked out perfect! - Oh, yeah
Hello I'm Dr Sheldon Cooper
And I'm Dr Amy Farrah Fowler
And this is: Dr Sheldon Cooper
and Dr Amy Farrah Fowler present
BOTH: Dr Sheldon Cooper's Fun with Flags 
I'd like to start this episode by apologizing on behalf
of Dr Fowler, who made the wild claim last week
that there was no national tricolored flag
with a purple stripe, when, in fact,
the Estonian governorate inside the Russian Empire
had a purple stripe on their flag from 1721 to 1917
See? Right there in the middle
And I'd like to apologize on behalf of Dr Cooper
for having his zipper down for the entire segment
on the flags of East Africa
Sorry, Tanzania, you deserve better
All right, on today's episode,
we're gonna start with some viewer e-mails
Oh, take off your glasses so people can't see
your password in the reflection
Oh, s-sure
Okay, our first e-mail is-- mm-- from
uh, Brad or Brian?
- I don't know, maybe it's Seth - All right, put them back on
Oh Uh oh, my gosh, it's from Fermilab in Chicago
Ah Not surprising, the Windy City
Great flag town
No, no, it's about our paper
A team of physicists confirmed super-asymmetry
Our paper was right
We did it
We did it?
We did it
We did it
BOTH: We did it!
- We did it! - We did it!
Aw, remember when they only did it on her birthday?
Ooh, it's freezing out here
Would you like me to heat things up?
No, I want to get in the hot tub before I lose a toe
Oh That is bright!
Yeah, a new neighbor put in floodlights
Huh
So, shall we?
No I don't want
to take my robe off under a spotlight
This is a candle body
Howdy, neighbors!
We haven't met yet I'm Andy
Oh Hello Nice to meet you
You know, your new balcony kind of looks right over our fence
You might want to put up some trees We can see everything
You can, but it's okay if you don't
So, can you turn your lights off?
Sorry, they're motion-sensored
They'll go off in a minute Just try to stay still
What are we gonna do about this?
I say we wait until his lights go off,
and then I make hot, motionless love to you
Don't move It's go time
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
Uh, we sort of have another reason for asking you here
We want to have a baby,
but we can't do it on our own
Okay, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, this has been such a nice evening
Let's all just stop before anyone says any more things
Leonard, would you be the father of our baby?
Oh, you said a thing
Thank you, guys, again for agreeing to do this
Yeah, it means so much to us
Ah, we're happy we can help
Yeah, and we don't find it weird at all
It's a little weird for us, too
I mean, instead of our baby looking like Zack,
it's gonna look like Leonard
Or Penny if it's a girl
No, no, it's not gonna look
Sure
But I promise,
we're gonna be really good parents
Mm-hmm
Oh, we know you will
- So, what is the next step? - Yeah
Well, Leonard, we were hoping you'd go in on Monday
Okay
And they say, for the best results,
between now and then, you shouldn't have sex
Sorry, bro,
I know it seems impossible to go for five days without,
but I believe in you
Five days? My record is 24 years
Uh, I think that also means no flying solo
Oh
Then my record is 14 years
And, well, we're really hoping for a son
So just, like, keep that in mind when you're in there
Yeah, just think, "Little boys, little boys"
Still just totally not weird
Hello
Oh, hey, Sheldon We're kind of in the middle of something
Oh, I won't be a moment I just need to grab a book
off a high shelf, which I can do
because I am both tall and smart
Sheldon, come home!
They don't want to have your baby!
I don't know what you're talking about
Oh-oh, dear, I think I got something in my eye
My piercing, blue eye
- Sheldon! - Fine
I've also never had a cavity and I don't have asthma
All right, Professor Proton fans,
get ready to meet Dr Sheldon Cooper
and Dr Amy Farrah Fowler, a pair of real-life scientists
who may win the Nobel Prize
That's like the Kids' Choice Award,
but with more science and less slime
Hi, thanks for having us
Kids' Choice Award?
Why would they let kids choose anything?
They're basically human larvae
Well, they are kind of our target audience
Greetings, children
Toys, am I right?
He is He has hundreds of them
So you two have discovered something
that a lot of people are really excited about
We have
Now, before you explain it,
keep in mind that our average viewer is this many
Okay, imagine you're looking in a mirror
The image you see looks just like you
That's called symmetrical
Now imagine you have a billion mirrors,
and each of them reflects one thing about you correctly
and a billion things about you incorrectly
And imagine the set of incorrect things
are floating in an abstract n-dimensional hyperspace
Now imagine there was never a mirror to begin with
Oh, was that a doorbell?
I didn't hear anything
Huh, there it is again
Sheldon, why don't you answer it?
But I don't know who it is
Maybe it's a special guest who I invited just to surprise you
Why don't you open it up and find out
This is a terrible message to send to children
Children, you never open the door
if you don't know who's on the other side
You always make your mommy or daddy do it
while you hide under the bed and try to imagine
what your superhero name will be when you avenge their deaths
I'll get it
But it can't be The Silver Shadow-- that's mine
Hello
Captain on the bridge! Captain on the bridge!
You're William Shatner
You can call me Bill
Ooh, can I call you Captain? No
Please? No
Please?
Sure
And w-will you call me Science Officer Cooper?
This has got to stop
I think you know how to make it stop
Put her there, Science Officer Cooper
Put her there, Science Officer Cooper
Oh, poor Shatner
Poor Shatner? I have to eat lunch now
Look, Sheldon's pretty embarrassed,
so when he gets here, we should
Make fun of him? A lot
Guys, don't you think that's a little mean?
Yeah
Okay, just so we're all on the same page
Yeah
- Hello - Hey
So, Sheldon, did you get
William Shatner's autograph, or maybe his dry cleaning bill?
Very funny, get it all out
Like you did on William Shatner?
Raj, do you have something to add?
You brought shame upon yourself and your family
It's not funny, but it's true
I will admit the meeting did not go the way I wanted
Because you barfed where no man has barfed before?
Well, the next time I meet him, it will go better
Next time? What makes you think there's gonna be a next time?
Wil will give me another chance He thinks the world of me
Aw One of the reasons I love you
is you actually believe that
Thank you
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
The drug I've been working on
for the past five years just got approved by the FDA
- Wow - Oh Congratulations
Was that the decongestant you developed?
No, we had to rebrand that as a solvent for mining equipment
It's her anti-inflammatory drug
Oh
Yep, three years of testing and no reported side effects
- Hmm, so it works - Eh
Well, congratulations, I'm so happy for you
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you
because I want you to head up my sales team
Really? Me? Don't you want someone with more experience?
No, the job's all yours
All right, now I'm sure some of you are wondering,
"Who is this woman?
"How did she get to be in charge of the sales team?
Is it because she's friends with Dr Rostenkowski?"
Because she is
"Is it because she was Miss Cornhusker 2001
and still fits in those very same jeans?"
Because she was, and she does
and they're actually a little baggy
"And the absence of side effects means that Inflaminex
"can be taken in conjunction with other medications
It's a brand-new day"
Such a good tagline, I forgot, who came up with that?
- You did - That's right, I did
Okay, I know it's late and I've been
working you guys really hard,
so I have a little treat for you
- We get to go home? - No
You get to stay here and get vitamin B12 shots
Oh, my God You guys are still here?
We're happy to be here It's a brand-new day
It's 12:15, it's literally a brand-new day
Everybody go home
All right, fine Go, get out of here
Go on
I think things are going pretty good
Are you aware that Dave's in the break room crying?
Yeah, I told him if he's gonna be a crybaby,
go to the break room
I just really want to be prepared
for this conference - You're gonna do great
You really think so?
Of course; they're scared of you,
you're scared of me-- The system works
Peviously, on "The Big Bang Theory"
We just published a few months ago
How did you have time to design an experiment?
This whole thing is actually a gigantic accident
You weren't even thinking about super-asymmetry?
Thinking about it? (chuckles)
- We don't even understand it - (both laugh)
Uh, can you believe this?
Doctors Pemberton and Campbell have been doing
a press tour trying to take credit for super-asymmetry
So what? I mean, no one's gonna give them credit
for accidentally discovering something
WOLOWITZ: Yeah, who remembers the guy
who was trying to find India
and discovered America instead?
What was his name again? (chuckles)
Now stop trying to steal our Nobel Prize
You come up with your own idea
Yeah, that's not gonna happen
ELLEN (over TV): Have a seat, thanks for being here 
I feel the same way about you 
This is nice
All my friends hanging out, watching Ellen 
It's like, what am I gonna do with my other two wishes?
It's not nice She's having on the scientists
who are trying to steal our Nobel Prize
Although I will enjoy watching her expose
Pemberton and Campbell
for the coattail-riding frauds that they are
That is Ellen's brand, gotcha journalism
Yeah, you should've seen her take down
John Krasinski last week
Got him to admit he loved his wife It was brutal
(shushing) All right, our next guests
are a couple of physicists Don't turn the channel
They've been doing some viral videos online
about what it's like to be in the running for a Nobel Prize
Please welcome Doctors Greg Pemberton
and Kevin Campbell
(cheering, applause)
Why does she even want to have scientists on?
Uh, silly question Who else will give her audience
causal explanations of natural phenomena?
I love you, honey, but think
So you guys
have discovered something pretty amazing in the universe
Obviously, I understand, uh, high-level physics
because I'm a comedian, but (laughter)
can you explain it to the audience?
Well, I don't know, I'm not sure we're even smart enough
to understand it (laughter)
Look, look, the audience is laughing at them It's starting
I hate to say it, Sheldon, but I think the audience likes them
Well, that will all change when Ellen asks them
how super-asymmetry explains the cosmological excess of matter
over anti-matter and they panic,
like Leonard trying to do a pull-up
Hey, what'd I do?
Not a pull-up
People have been loving your videos,
especially the-the songs that you've been posting
- Oh, thanks - Thank you
Uh, this may be pushing it, but I have to ask
Would you mind singing one of those for us right now?
- Oh, why not? - All right
Come on, Ellen, they're right there Go for the jugular
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
We conclusively proved super-asymmetry,
and yet somehow we-we still feel like imposters
Yeah, there should be a term for that
Oh, for crying out loud, there is a term for that!
It's called "imposter syndrome,"
and you don't have it, because you can't have it
if you are imposters, and you are!
We're the ones who discovered super-asymmetry,
so if anyone's gonna feel like they have imposter syndrome,
it's us, because we're not imposters, they are!
You're imposters and you're frauds!
Is that what I would've sounded like?
Yeah Yikes
Sheldon, look at this
(stammers) Wait a minute
How do I know this isn't one of those joke phones
that squirts water in my face?
Because that's not even a thing Look
You got called into human resources?
I'm sure it's because I insulted Pemberton and Campbell
in a room full of Nobel Laureates
You did do that
It was awkward People didn't know where to look
This is a twist
Usually you're the one getting called into HR
KOOTHRAPPALI: Yeah, now it's Amy
Who knew you were married to such a bad girl
I suppose the signs were always there
I mean, she did recently go to that rave at the mall
It was a Spencer's Gifts
There was music and a strobe light
If that isn't a rave, then I don't know what one is
You don't know what one is
Guys, come on, I think I'm in trouble
It's no big deal I used to get called into HR
all the time Ms Davis is great
Pro tip: if you find strong women sexy,
do not say it out loud
(phone chimes)
Oh! She wants to see me, too
All right, let's get our story straight:
This is all your fault
Relax
You're probably just gonna get a slap on the wrist
Maybe, but do not ask for that, on the wrist or anywhere else
Oh, the there's a 7:15 at the ArcLight
Well, that doesn't give us much time to eat
We can eat afterwards
I'm not gonna eat at 10:00 at night
Who am I, Hemingway?
Why do you think Hemingway ate at 10:00?
He spent a lot of time in Spain They eat dinner late
He also spent a lot of time in Florida
Last time I was there, people were eating dinner
at, like, 4:30
You guys know
that Hemingway had cats with six toes?
Six toes per foot or six toes total?
Okay
It's official We're never going to see the Avengers 
Guys, just come on Make a decision
I-I'm good with eating after
- Mm, I'm kind of hungry now - Yeah, me, too
- Then we'll eat before - Okay
So, then, we can see the 3-D at 9:00 or the 2-D at 9:30
3-D If I'm gonna see Thor,
I want to feel like I could lick those abs
Actually, 3-D kind of makes me queasy
No, but we have to see it in 3-D
We saw part one in 3-D, and the 2-D part two
is not the part two of the 3-D part one
He's got you there, Leonard Or he doesn't
I don't really care anymore
Okay, then,
- we'll go see it in 3-D - No
Sweetie, you shouldn't do things that make you feel bad
Well, I'm doing this
And of course he is
He is a textbook satisficer
That's not even a word
Uh, yes, it is
According to Nobel Prize-winning economist Herbert Simon,
satisficing is a decision-making strategy
whereby a person accepts
whatever available option is satisfactory
rather than seeking out a course of action
that would make him happiest,
as I just did when I explained what satisficing was
He's right
No one wanted to hear at
He knew it, yet he plowed ahead
I'm just trying to find a plan
that makes everyone happy
Except you
Yeah, Leonard What would make you happy?
I could tell you about satisficing again
You know, what would make me happy
is if we just stop talking about this
and see whatever movie you guys want to see
whenever you want to see it
Okay But next time, we get to pick
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
We conclusively proved super-asymmetry,
and yet somehow we-we still feel like imposters
Yeah, there should be a term for that
Oh, for crying out loud, there is a term for that!
It's called "imposter syndrome,"
and you don't have it, because you can't have it
if you are imposters, and you are!
We're the ones who discovered super-asymmetry,
so if anyone's gonna feel like they have imposter syndrome,
it's us because we're not imposters, they are!
You're imposters and you're frauds!
I think what President Siebert is trying to say is that
this is a setback and we should adopt a different strategy
I-I'm sorry I-I just-- I-I snapped
Oh, you're sorry It's all better, then
Listen up, you have shot to win a Nobel Prize,
and you're blowing it
I think what President Siebert is trying to say
is that you have a shot to win a Nobel Prize,
and you're blowing it
Uh, that's exactly what he said
Yes, but I said it in my calming HR voice
So, obviously,
I'm really sorry about my outburst
Calling you frauds was unacceptable
I feel terrible about it
It has caused her a lot of stress
She chewed through her night guard
like it was a piece of jerky
What you said was really hurtful,
especially because I thought we were friends
Why would you think that?
Ouch
Ignore them; they're just mean people
Uh, not mean, just sorry
Seem mean, are sorry Happens all the time
It's okay I talked to my therapist,
and she made me realize that what you said
was really more about your own insecurities
I'm sorry, what?
There you go, she's sorry We all heard it Moving on
Yes, obviously,
you're angry at all the attention we're getting
for our discovery and you're lashing out
Well, uh, technically, she lashed out
I contained myself, which I don't think
I'm getting enough credit for
The point is we should take it as a compliment
that even you guys think we will win the Nobel Prize
Uh, no, we-we certainly do not think that
The Nobel Committee will realize
that we came up with this theory
But we proved it
By accident
All breakthroughs happen by accident
No, they don't!
Look, the Nobel Committee doesn't like infighting,
so if the four of you don't stop sniping at each other,
the award's gonna go to someone else entirely
He's right
You know, like it or not, we can't avoid each other
Let's at least try to be civil
Agreed
You know, when you think about it,
we're linked together the same way that super-asymmetry
links together every atom in the universe
Hmm
That's not what it does at all!
Well, that's the great thing about science
We all get to have our own opinions
I'm still not talking That's impressive, right?
Leonard, when are you leaving
to pick your mother up from the airport?
Uh, well, let's see, her plane gets in at 3:00,
figure half hour to get her luggage, so never
Never?
Isn't that usually when you go to the gym?
Are you really not gonna pick up your mother?
No-- it's fine, she likes to take a cab or a shuttle
That way she can meet people
Well, that's kind of nice
Yeah, she always says that a stranger is just
a person whose emotional weak point you haven't found yet
Your mom is the best
Oh, maybe I should pick her up
You don't drive
That's what makes you and me a great team
Go get your keys
You can't pick her up
It'll make me look like a bad son
I imagine that's one of the things
we'll talk about on the ride
That and Amy's recent reluctance
to use turn signals
We were in a parking garage
Come on, she gave birth to you
Fine, I'll pick her up
Good, I'll go with you
- I call back seat - Oh, I don't want to be
the only one who doesn't go
I'll just sit here afraid that you're all talking about me
We're not gonna talk about you
Well, that's my other fear
This is crazy I can pick her up by myself
So it's just you?
Previously, on The Big Bang Theory
Guess I'm your new neighbor Penny
- Oh Leonard Sheldon - Hi
- Hi - Hi
- Hi - Hi
That's where I sit
Howard Wolowitz
Caltech Department of Applied Physics
Penny?
Leonard
Raj?
WOLOWITZ: He speaks English-- he just can't speak to women
LEONARD: Our babies will be 
smart and beautiful
Finally caught a break
Previously, on The Big Bang Theory
Guess I'm your new neighbor Penny
- Oh Leonard Sheldon - Hi
- Hi - Hi

That's where I sit
Howard Wolowitz
Caltech Department of Applied Physics
Penny?
Leonard
Raj?
He speaks English-- he just can't speak to women
Our babies will be 
smart and beautiful
Finally caught a break
Here we go Pad thai, no peanuts
But does it have peanut oil?
I'm not sure
Everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up
Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine
- Are there any chopsticks - No need This is Thai food
Here we go
Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th Century
Interestingly they don't put the fork in their mouth--
they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth
Ask him for a napkin I dare you
I'll get it
Do I look puffy? I feel puffy
- Hey, Leonard - Oh, hi, Penny
- Am I interrupting? - No You're not swelling, Howard
Look at my fingers They're like Vienna sausages
- Sounds like you have company - They're not going anywhere
So, you're coming home from work That's great How was work?
You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory
People order cheesecake and I bring it to them
So you kind of act like a carbohydrate delivery system
Yeah Call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage
I was wondering if you could help me out
- with something - Yes
Great I'm having some furniture
delivered tomorrow and I may not be here, so
Hello
- I'm sorry? - Haven't you ever been told
how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?
No, I haven't
Get used to it
Yeah I probably won't
- Hey, Sheldon - Hi
Hey, Raj
Still not talking to me, huh?
Don't take it personally, it's his pathology
He can't talk to women
It can't talk to atractive woman, or in your case,
a cheesecake- scented goddess
So there's gonna be some furniture delivered?
If it gets here and I'm not here, could you sign
and have them put it in my apartment?
No problem
Great Here's my spare key Thank you
Penny, wait
If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us
for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
A marathon? How many Superman movies are there?
You're kidding, right?
I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter
and Superman swooshes down and catches her Which one was that?
One
You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy
Yes, I know, men can't fly
No Let's assume that they can
Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second
Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel
Miss Lane, who is now traveling
at approximately 120 miles an hour,
hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces
Unless Superman matches her speed and decelerates
In what space, sir? She's two feet above the ground
Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement
It'd be a more merciful death
Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption
that Superman's flight is a feat of strength
Are you listening to yourself? It is well established
that his flight is a feat of strength
It is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings,
an ability he derives from exposure to Earth's yellow sun
And how does he fly at night?
A combination of the moon's solar reflection
and the energy-storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells
I'm just gonna go wash up
I have 2,600 comic books in there I challenge you
to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells
Challenge accepted
We're locked out

Her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken, so
You're just gonna be done? Okay Cool Thanks
We'll just bring it up ourselves
I hardly think so
Why not?
Well, we don't have a dolly,
or lifting belts or any measurable upper-body strength
We don't need strength-- we're physicists
We are the intellectual descendants of Archimedes
Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth
It's just a matter of I don't have this
Archimedes would be so proud
Do you have any ideas?
Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring
Easy easy
Now we've got an inclined plane The force required to lift
is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs,
call it 30 degrees, so, about half
Exactly half
Exactly half
Let's push
See, it's moving, this is easy
It's all in the math
- What's your formula for the corner? - What?
Okay, no problem
Just come up here, help me pull and turn
Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch
You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds
of you having sexual congress with this woman
Men do things for women without expecting sex
Those would be men who just had sex
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor
In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds
Almost there
Almost there
- Almost there - No, we're not
- I'm sorry - No, we're not!
Watch your fingers
Oh, God, my fingers!
- You okay? - No, her
Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place
So Penny's a little messy
A little messy?
The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy
This is chaos
Excuse me
Explain to me an organizational system
where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid
I'm just inferring this is a couch
because the evidence suggests the coffee table
is having a tiny garage sale
Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has
the compulsive need to sort, organize and label
the entire world around them?
No
Well, they don't
Hard as it may be for you to believe,
most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content
Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times
- Come on, we should go - Hang on
- What are you doing? - I'm straightening up
This is not your home
This is not anyone's home This is a swirling vortex of entropy
When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place
Because it was immaculate
I mean, you opened that man's closet,
it was left to right evening gowns,
cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms
What were you doing in his closet?
I helped him run some cable for a web cam
This just arrived, we just brought this up just now
Great Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
- No - "No"?
No
No
Well, we'll get out of your hair
Okay, great Thank you again
I just want you to know that you don't have to live like this
I'm here for you
What's he talking about?
- It's a joke - I don't get it
Yeah, he didn't tell it right
Penny's sleeping
Are you insane?
You can't just break into a woman's apartment
in the middle of the night and clean
I had no choice I couldn't sleep knowing
that just outside my bedroom was our living room,
and just outside our living room was that hallway,
and immediately adjacent to the hallway was this
Do you realize that if Penny wakes up,
there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here
I just gave you a reasonable explanation
No, no, you gave me an explanation
Its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers
Don't be ridiculous I have no peers
We have to get out of here
You might want to speak in a lower register
What?
Evolution has made women sensitive
to high-pitched noises while they sleep
so that they'll be roused by a crying baby
If you want to avoid waking her,
speak in a lower register
That's ridiculous!
No
"That's ridiculous"
Fine
I accept your premise Now, please, let's go
I'm not leaving until I'm done
If you have time to lean, you have time to clean
Oh, what the hell
Morning
Morning
I have to say I slept splendidly
Granted, not long, but just deeply and well
I'm not surprised
A well-known folk cure for insomnia
is to break in your neighbor's apartment and clean
Sarcasm?
You think?
Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox,
but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement
- to Penny's quality of life - You've convinced me
Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet
- You don't think that crosses a line? - Yes
For God's sake,
do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth?
You have a sarcasm sign?
No, I do not have a sarcasm sign
Do you want some cereal? I feel so good today,
I'm gonna choose from the low-fiber end of the shelf
Hello, Honey Puffs
Son of a bitch!
Penny's up
You sick geeky bastards!
How did she know it was us?
I may have left a suggested organizational schematic
for her bedroom closet
God, this is gonna be bad
Good-bye, Honey Puffs Hello, Big Bran
You came into my apartment last night while I was sleeping?!
Yes, but only to clean
Really more to organize You're not actually dirty, per se
Give me back my key
I'm very, very sorry
Do you understand how creepy this is?
Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night
In my apartment, while I was sleeping?!
And snoring And that's probably just a sinus infection
But it could be sleep apnea
You might want to see an otolaryngologist
A throat doctor
And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
Depending on the depth,
that's either a proctologist
or a general surgeon
I think what you're feeling
is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later
when you're feeling a little less for lack of a better word-- violated,
maybe we can talk about this some more
- Stay away from me - Sure, that's another way to go
Penny, Penny!
Just to clarify,
because there will be a discussion when you leave,
is your objection solely to our presence
in the apartment while you were sleeping,
or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm
Well, that was a little non-responsive
You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize
What's funny?
That wasn't sarcasm?
Boy, you are all over the place this morning
I have a master's and two PhDs, I should not have to do this
What?!
I am truly sorry for what happened last night
I take full responsibility
And I hope that it won't color your opinion of Leonard,
who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear,
a gentle and thorough lover
I did what I could
Hey, Raj
Hey, listen
I don't know if you heard about what happened last night
but I'm really upset about it
I mean, they just they let themselves into my place
and then they cleaned it Can you even believe that?
How weird is that?
She's standing very close to me 
Oh, my, she does smell good 
What is that, vanilla? 
You know, where I come from,
if someone comes into your house at night, you shoot Okay?
And you don't shoot to wound
I mean, all right, my sister shot her husband,
but it was an accident, they were drunk
Wait, what was I saying?
She's so chatty 
Maybe my parents are right |
Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl 
We'd have the same cultural background 
and my wife could sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me 
It's obvious that they meant well, but
I'm having a really rough time I broke up with my boyfriend
and
Just because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks,
doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are
Right?
She asked me a question I should probably nod 
That's exactly what I thought
Thank you for listening You're a doll
Turn your pelvis
Grab a napkin, homie You just got served
It's fineYou win
What's his problem?
His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him
Been there
Sorry I'm late,
but I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny
Really? You, Rajesh Koothrappali, spoke to Penny?
Actually, I was less the chatter than the chat-ee
What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
Well, she was upset at first,
but probably because her sister shot somebody
But then there was something about you,
and then she hugged me
She hugged you? How'd she hug you?
Is that her perfume I smell?
Intoxicating, isn't it?
Hi
What's going on?
Here's the thing
"Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions
"to the first atomic bomb,
"so too I regret my participation in what was,
"at the very least, an error in judgment
"The hallmark of the great human experiment
"is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes
"Some mistakes, such as Madam Curie's discovery of radium,
"turned out to have great scientific potential,
"even though she would later die a slow, painful death "from radiation poisoning
Another example, from the field of Ebola research"
We're okay
- Six two inch dowels - Check
- One package Phillips head screws - Check
You guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay?
I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was, like, 12
I think I can put together a cheap, Swedish media center
No, please We insist It's the least we can do, considering
Considering what?
How great this place looks?
- Oh, boy I was afraid of this - What?
These instructions are a pictographic representation
of the least imaginative way to assemble these components
This, right here is why Sweden has no space program
Well, it looked pretty good in the store
It is an inefficient design For example, she has a flat screen TV,
which means all the space behind it is wasted
- We could put her stereo back there - And control it how?
Run an infrared repeater
Photo cell here, emitter here, easy-peasy
How are you gonna cool it?
- Hey, guys, I got this - Hang on, Penny
How about fans? Here and here
Also inefficient, and might be loud
How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here,
run some quarter-inch PVC
Guys, this is actually really simple
Hold on, honey Men at work
The PVC comes down here
Maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here
Yeah? Show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice, and an overflow reservoir
If water's involved, we're gonna have to ground the crap out of the thing
It's hot in here I think I'll just take off all my clothes
Oh, I've got it
What about if we replace
panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?
Right Then the entire thing is one heat sink
You and Sheldon go to the junkyard and pick up
6 square meters of scrap aluminum?
Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch
- Meet back here in an hour? - Done
Okay, this place does look pretty good

Alright, just a few more feet
And here we are, gentlemen,
the Gates of Elzebob
Good Lord
Don't panic This is what the last 97 hours have been about
Stay frosty There's a horde of armed goblins
on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Asaroth
Warriors, unsheathe your weapons Magic wielders, raise your wands
Lock and load
Raj, blow the gates
Blowing the gates
Control,
shift B!
Oh, my God, so many goblins!
Don't just stand there, slash and move!
Stay in formation!
Leonard, you got one on your tail
My tail's prehensile-- I'll swat him off
I got him, Leonard
Tonight I spice my mead with goblin blood
Raj, no, it's a trap! They're flanking us!
He's got me!
Sheldon, he's got Raj Use your sleep spell!
I've got the Sword of Asaroth!
Forget the sword, help Raj!
There is no more Sheldon I am the sword master!
- Leonard, look out! - Damn it, man, we're dying here!
Good-bye, peasants!
The bastard teleported!
He's selling the Sword of Asaroth on eBay
You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
I'm a rogue night elf
Don't you people read character descriptions?
Wait, wait! Somebody just clicked "Buy it now"
I am the sword master!
* sweety
Anybody want to log on to Second Life and go swimming?
I just built a virtual pool
No I can't look at you or your avatar right now
Sounds like your neighbor's home
Excuse me
Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose
as an excuse to talk to her
Oh, right, right, right
Stealing snail mail-- very old school I like it
Penny, the mailman, did it again
Sorry
Hi, Leonard This is Doug
Doug, this is my neighbor Leonard
What's up, bro?
Not much
bro
Is everything okay?
Yeah, no, I just I got your mail again Here
Thank you I've got to talk to that mailman
Oh, no, that's probably not such a good idea
Civil servants have a documented propensity
to, you know, snap, so
Okay Well, thank you again
No problem Bye
Oh, and bye bro
Penny for your thoughts
What's the matter?
I'm fine
Penny's fine The guy she's kissing is really fine
Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?
What is wrong with you?
I'm a romantic
Don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation
is devolving into pointless jealousy
I'm not jealous I'm just a little concerned for her
I didn't like the look of the guy
Because he looks better than you?
He was kind of dreamy
At least now you can retrieve the black box
from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her
and analyze the data so that you don't crash
into Geek Mountain again
I disagree
Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon--
a relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms
or hits you with the pepper spray
I'm done with Penny
I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed
- Like who? - I don't know
Olivia Geiger
The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
I don't think you have a shot there
I have noticed that Leslie Winkle recently started shaving her legs
Now given that winter is coming,
one can only assume she's signaling sexual availability
I don't know You guys work in the same lab
- So? - There are pitfalls
Trust me, I know
When it comes to sexual harassment law,
I'm a bit of a self-taught expert
If I were to ask Leslie Winkle out,
it would just be for dinner I'm not going to walk into the lab,
ask her to strip naked and dance for me
Oh, then you're probably okay
- Hello, Leslie - Hi, Leonard
I'd like to propose an experiment
- Goggles, Leonard - Right
I would like to propose an experiment
Hang on
I'm trying to see how long it takes a 500-kilowatt
oxygen iodine laser to heat up my Cup a' Noodles
I've done it About two seconds 26 for minestrone
Anyway, I was thinking more
of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay
Wait, are you asking me out?
I was going to characterize it as the modification
of our colleague-slash-friendship paradigm
with the addition of a date-like component,
but we don't need to quibble over terminology
What sort of experiment?
There's a generally accepted pattern in this area
I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant
Then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy
featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock
Interesting And would you agree
that the primary way we would evaluate either the success
or failure of the date would be
based on the biochemical reaction during the good night kiss?
Heart rate, pheromones, etc Yes
Why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well
and move to the key variable?
- You mean kiss you now? - Yes
Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
Close-mouthed but romantic Mint?
Thank you
I count down from three?
No, I think it needs to be spontaneous
- What do you think? - You proposed the experiment
I think you should present your findings first
Fair enough
On the plus side, it was a good kiss
Reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle
On the other hand, no arousal
- None? - None
- Thank you for your time - Thank you
None at all?
Sheldon, if you were a robot,
and I knew and you didn't
would you want me to tell you?
That depends
When
I learn that I'm a robot
will I be able to handle it?
Maybe-- although the history of science fiction is not on your side
Okay, let me ask you this--
when I learn that I'm a robot,
would I be bound by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?
You might be bound by them right now
That's true Have you ever harmed a human being
or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?
- Of course not - Have you ever harmed yourself
or allowed yourself to be harmed
except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?
- Well, no - I smell robot
Hey, what's going on?
Internet's been down for half an hour
Also, Sheldon may be a robot
So how'd it go with Leslie?
Oh, we tried kissing, but the Earth didn't move
I mean, any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway
Oh, I've seen that look before
This is just going to be two weeks of moping
and tedious emo songs
and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats
I don't know if I can take it
You could power down
As usual, Wolowitz has the solution
I happen to know a place
where there are plenty of eligible women and Leonard could have his pick
Remember the Latin hips
Shoulders stay still, and we sway
One, two, three
five, six, seven
I think Mrs Tishman's got her eye on you
I've been there You're in for a treat
Oh, good Lord
God, that's a good song
If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide
Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you
I know what you're thinking I've taken your asthma into account
There's a feline geneticist in San Diego
who's developed the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos
- Listen to me - I've been thinking about names
I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton
and Sergeant Fuzzy Boots
Do you really think you can satisfy your need
for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?
Maybe
If it's a cute, little, cuddly cat
Oh, come on Leonard
This is obviously about Penny
It doesn't matter
The woman's not interested in me The woman rejected me
Look,
I think that you have as much of a chance
of having a sexual relationship with Penny
as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole
is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker
Nevertheless,
I do feel obligated to point out to you
that she did not reject you
You did not ask her out
You're right
I didn't ask her out I should ask her out
No, no, that was not my point
My point was don't buy a cat
No, but you're right
I should march over there and ask her out
Oh, goody, we're getting a cat
Good afternoon, Penny So, hi hey
I was wondering if you had plans for dinner
You mean dinner tonight?
There is an inherent ambiguity in the word "dinner"
Technically it refers
to the largest meal of the day whenever it's consumed
So to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper
- Supper? - Or dinner
I was thinking 6:30 if you can go Or a different time
6:30's great
Really?
- Great - I like hanging out with you guys
Us guys?
Yeah, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj Who all's coming?
They
might all be there
Or a subset of them might be there
Algebraically speaking, there are too many unknowns
For example, Sheldon had Quiznos for lunch
Sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn't
It's no fault of Quiznos-- they have a varied menu
Okay, whatever It sounds like fun
Great
- Did we say a time? - 6:30
- And that's still good? - It's fine
- 'Cause it's not carved in stone - No, 6:30's great
I'll get my chisel
Why?
To carve the I'll see you at 6:30
How do I look?
Could you be more specific?
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
No The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely
- What time is your date? - 6:30
Perfect That gives you
two hours and 15 minutes for that dense molecular cloud
of Aramis to dissipate
Is it too much?
Not if you're a rugby team
If it should ever come up,
you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself
with a chicken carbonara sub at Quiznos
Why would I join you?
No reason
You know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea
No, well, now there's always the possibility
that alcohol and poor judgment on her part
might lead to a nice romantic evening
You're right Alcohol, poor judgment-- it could go well
There is the other possibility, that
this date kicks off a rather unpleasant 6 months
of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall,
until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code
You could've stopped at "it could go well"
If I could've, I would've
I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy
There's no reason we couldn't go and have a lovely dinner,
maybe take a walk afterwards,
talk about things we have in common
You love pottery? I love pottery!
There's a pause,
we both know what's happening I lean in, we kiss
It's a little tentative at first, but then I realize
she's kissing me back She's biting my lower lip!
She wants me! This thing is going the distance!
We're going to have sex! Oh, God, oh, my God!
Is the sex starting now?
I'm having a panic attack
Well then calm down
If I could, I wouldn't be having a panic
That's why they call it a panic attack
Sit down
Yeah, sit down Now close your eyes
- Why? - Just do it
Now try to increase your alpha wave activity
- What?! - It's a biofeedback technique
It's relaxation through brain wave manipulation
I read a paper about it in Journal of American Neuroscience
It was a little sparsely sourced, but I think the basic science is valid
I probably have it here somewhere
Who am I kidding? I can't go through with this
You need to call her and cancel
- Me? - Yes
- What should I tell her? - I don't know Tell her I'm sick
Not an illness that will make her want to take care of me,
but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable
going out with me if I want to try this again
Got it So I'm assuming nothing venereal?
I'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy
and haven't quite bounced back
- Give me the phone - I thought you wanted to cancel
I can't, because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you
Why would she be expecting me?
Stop asking me all these questions
I need to take another shower
So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
Oh, yeah no
It turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon
had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet
My uncle just had a colonoscopy
You're kidding
Then that's something we have in common
How?
We both have people in our lives who
want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud
So what's new in the world of physics?
Nothing
Really? Nothing?
Well, with the exception of string theory,
not much has happened since the 1930s
And you can't prove string theory
At best you can say,
"Hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency"
Well, I'm sure things will pick up
What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?
Not much
We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well
Good
Good
What about your
hallway friend?
Doug? Oh, yeah, I don't know
I mean, you know, he's nice and funny, but
Can I get you started with some drinks?
- You were saying? But - I'd like a drink
Just say the "but" thing about Doug and then I'll get her back
I don't know, it's just me
I'm still getting over this breakup with Kurt
and this thing with Doug would just be rebound sex
Don't get me started on rebound sex
It's just it's my pattern
I break up, then I find some cute guy,
and then it's just 36 meaningless hours of
you know
I'm not sure that I do
Is that one 36-hour experience,
or is that 36 hours spread out over, say
one glorious summer?
No, it's usually over a weekend,
and trust me, you do not feel good after it
Well, chafing, right?
Emotionally
Of course, yeah, emotional chafing
Do you want to see something cool?
I can make this olive go into this glass
without touching it
- How? - Physics
Centrifugal force
Actually, it's centripetal force,
which is an inward force generated by the glass
acting on the olive
Excuse me
If you were riding on the olive,
you'd be in a non-inertial reference frame
and would
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay
Did you spill ketchup?
- No - I'm not okay
You sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?
No, I'm okay It stopped bleeding
I know, but you did throw up Isn't that a sign of a concussion?
Yes But I get car sick, too, so
Sorry about your car, by the way
It's fine You got most of it out the window
The poor guy on the bike
I had a nice time
Yeah, me, too
Well, um, good night
Good night
Was this supposed to be a date?
This?
No
Of course not This was just you and me
hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up
'cause of work and a colonoscopy
Okay, I was just checking
When I take a girl on a date--
and I do--
she knows she's been dated
Capital D
Boldface Underlined Dated
I think I might have a little concussion
I'm gonna go lie down for a while Good night
So, how was your date?
Awesome!
Score 1 for liquor and poor jugement
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
You know, I've been thinking about timetravel again
Why? Did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Put it on a backburner
Anyway It occurs to me,
If I have ever did perfect time machine,
I'd just go into the past and give it to myself
That's eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place
Interesting
Yeah, it really kicks the pressure off
Sounds like a breakthrough
Should I call Science Magazine and tell them to hold the cover?
It's time travel, I will have already done that
Then I guess congratulations are in order
No, congratulations will have been in order
You know, I am not going to enjoy this party
I know, I'm familiar with you
The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me
and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes
Yes, I was there
You know what's interesting about caves?
- What? - Nothing
Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head,
congratulate him, shake his hand and go
How's this? "Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehauser
"How fortunate for you that the university's
"chosen to hire you, despite the fact
"that you've done no original research in 25 years,
"and instead have written a series of popular books
"that reduce the great concepts of science
"to a series of anecdotes,
"each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration
"of an average bowel movement
Mahalo"
"Mahalo's" a nice touch
You know there only eight consonants in Hawaiian language?
Interesting You should lead with that
Oh, God, look at this buffet
I love America
You don't have buffets in India?
Of course, but it's all Indian food
You can't find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life
Shmear me
- Here's an interesting turn of events - What?
Howard brought a date?
A more plausible explanation is that
his work in robotics has made
an amazing leap forward
Hey, what up, science bitches?
May I introduce my
special lady friend Summer?
- I told you touching's extra - Right Sorry
Here comes our new boss Be polite
Hi, fellas Eric Gablehauser
Howard Wolowitz
Nice to meet you And you are?
An actualrealscientist
How was that?
I can't believe he fired me
Well, you did call him a glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts
In my defense,
I prefaced that by saying, "With all due respect"
Synchro: Sixe
Morning
Morning
You're making eggs for breakfast?
This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment
'Cause it looks a lot like breakfast
I finally have time to test my hypothesis
about the separation of the water molecules
from the egg proteins and its impact vis-a-vis taste
Sounds yummy
I look forward to your work with bacon
As do I
You know, I'm sure if you just apologize
to Gablehauser, he would give you your job back
I don't want my job back
I've spent the past three and a half years
staring at grease boards full of equations
Before that, I spent four years working on my thesis
Before that, I was in college,
and before that, I was in the fifth grade
This is my first day off in decades and I'm going to savor it
I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs
Not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs
And we all thank you
Use new eggs
I'm running out to the market You need anything?
This would be one of those circumstances
that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence
- I'm sorry? - I need eggs
Four dozen should suffice
- Four dozen? - Yes,
and evenly distributed amongst brown, white,
free-range, large, extra large and jumbo
Okay, one more time
Never mind You won't get it right
I'd better come with you
How come you didn't go into work today?
I'm taking a sabbatical
because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds
So you got canned, huh?
Theoretical physicists do not get canned
but yeah
Maybe it's all for the best
I always say when one door closes, another one opens
No, it doesn't
Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
- or there are motion sensors involved - No, I meant
Or if the first door closing creates a change of air pressure
that acts upon the second door
Never mind
Slow down
- Please, slow down! - We're fine!
You're not leaving yourself enough space between cars
- Oh, sure, I am - No, let me do the math for you
This car weighs, let's say 4,000 pounds
Now add 140 for me, 120 for you
120?
I'm sorry Did I insult you?
Is your body mass somehow tied into your self-worth?
Well, yeah
Interesting
Anyway, that gives us a total weight of,
let's say 4,400 pounds
Let's say 4,390
Fine We're traveling forward at--
good Lord-- 51 miles an hour
Let's assume that your brakes
are new and the calipers are aligned
Still, by the time we come to a stop,
we'll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us,
an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve
into death, mutilation
Oh, look, they built a new putt-putt course
This is great
Look at me
I'm in the real world of ordinary people
just living their ordinary, colorless workaday lives
Thank you
No, thankyou
And thank you, ordinary person
You want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes?
No, not really
Listen, didn't you say you need some eggs?
Yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth
knows to pick up their refrigerated food on the way out of the supermarket
Okay, then maybe you should start heading on out then
No, this is fun
Oh, the thing about tomatoes-- and I think you'll really enjoy this--
is they're shelved with the vegetables, but they're technically a fruit
- Interesting - Isn't it?
No, I mean what you find enjoyable
Oh, boy
What now?
Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin,
but the human body can only absorb so much
What you're buying here
are the ingredients for very expensive urine
Well, maybe that's what I was going for
Then you'll want some manganese
That was fun
Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores
Oh, I don't know
It's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today
Are you sure?
There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk
For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons
one-month supply at a time
What?
Think about it It's a product that doesn't spoil
and you're going to be needing them for at least the next 30 years
You want me to buy 30 years worth of tampons?
Well, 30, 35 When did your mother go into menopause?
I'm not talking about this with you
This is a natural human process,
and we're talking about statistically significant savings
Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28-day cycle
Are you fairly regular?
Okay, no warehouse store,
but we're still on for putt-putt golf, right?
Hey, I just ran into Penny She seemed upset about something
I think it's her time of the month
I marked the calendar for future reference
What's with the fish?
It's an experiment
What happened to your scrambled egg research?
Oh, that was a dead end
Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be
So fish?
I read an article about Japanese scientists
who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals,
and I thought, "Hey, fish nightlights"
Fish nightlights?
It's a billion-dollar idea
Mum's the word
Are you sure you don't want
to just apologize to Gablehauser and get your job back?
No, I have too much to do
Like luminous fish
I'm sorry I didn't
That's just the beginning
I also have an idea
for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company
Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons!
Leonard, we're gonna be rich
Thanks for coming on such short notice
- You did the right thing calling - I didn't know what else to do
He's lost all focus Every day he's got a new obsession
This is a particularly disturbing one
Mommy?
Hi, baby!
Oh, you got yourself a loom? How nice!
Thank you
Honey, why'd you get a loom?
I was working with luminous fish, and I thought
"loom"
Mom, what are you doing here?
Leonard called me
I know, but why?
Because one of the great minds of the 21st century
is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving serapes
This is not a serape, this is a poncho
A serape is open at the sides; a poncho is closed
This is a poncho
And neither is a reason to call someone'smother
Really? When was the last time you left the house?
I went to the market with Penny
That was three weeks ago
Well, then buckle up In the next four to eight days
she's going to get very crabby
Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you
Yes, well, I'm not a child-- I'm a grown man,
capable of living my life as I see fit
And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother!
Wait, where are you going?
To my room And no one's allowed in!
He gets his temper from his daddy
He's got my eyes
I see
All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus
- Sheldon, your mom made dinner - I'm not hungry!
Don't trouble yourself He's stubborn
He may stay in there till the Rapture
We so sure that's abadthing?
I tell you, I love the boy to death,
but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart
Excuse me for being so bold,
but I now see where Sheldon gets his smoldering good looks
Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep tryin'
I made chicken
I hope that isn't one of the animals that you people think is magic
You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church,
a Dr Patel-- It's a beautiful story
The Lord spoke to him and moved him to give us all 20% off on Lasik--
You know, those that needed it
That is a lovely story
Are we gonna do anything about Sheldon?
Oh, we will You have to take your time with Sheldon
His father, God rest his soul, used to always say to me,
"Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon"
- Sounds like a wise man - Oh, not so wise
He once tried to fight a bobcat for some licorice
So, everybody grab a plate
and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove
Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before?
Oh, all the time
I remember one summer when he was 13,
he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed
and told everybody he was gonna provide free electricity for the whole town
Well, the only problem was,
he had no what you call "fissionable" materials
Anyway, when he went on the Internets to get some,
a man from the government came by and sat him down
real gentle, and told him it's against the law
to have yellow-cake uranium in a shed
- What happened? - Well, poor boy had a fit
Locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray
A death ray?
That's what he called it Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids
It pissed our dog off to no end
You know, you two make a cute couple
No We're not we're not-not a couple
We're singles Two singles
Like those individuly wrapped slices of cheese that
We're friends
- Did I pluck a nerve there? - Oh, yeah
All right, everybody, it's time to eat
Oh, Lord, we thank You for this meal
and all of Your bounty
And we pray that You help Sheldon
get back on his rocker
Now, after a moment of silent meditation,
I'm gonna end with "In Jesus' name,"
but you two don't feel any obligation to join in
Unless, of course, the Holy Spirit moves you
Oh, my God, this is the best cobbler I've ever had
It was always Sheldon's favorite
You know what the secret ingredient is?
- Love? - Lard
Hey, look who's come
You'll spook him
He's like a baby deer You got to let him come to you
This is ridiculous Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it!
You're a physicist--
You belong at the university doing research, not hiding in your room!
You don't hunt, do you?
Good morning, snickerdoodle
Morning
Well, that looks awful fancy What is that?
It's my idea of what DNA would look like
in a silicon-based life-form
But intelligently designed by a creator, right?
What do you want, Mom?
You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long
before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?
Well, I'm done fishing
You put those on
- What for? - Because you're gonna
go down to your office, you're gonna apologize
to your boss and get your job back
No I'm sorry,
did I start that sentence with the words,
"If it please Your Highness"?
I'm not going to apologize-- I didn't say anything that wasn't true
Now, you listen here
I have been telling you since you were four years old,
it's okay to be smarter than everybody,
but you can't go around pointing it out
- Why not? - Because people don't like it!
Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbor kids?
Now, let's get crackin'
Shower, shirt, shoes, and let's shove off
There wouldn't have been any ass-kickings
if that stupid death ray had worked
Problem solved
Really? That's impressive
Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle
Thankfully, He blessed me with two other children
who are dumb as soup
Excuse me, Dr Gablehauser, are you busy?
- Well, actually - Sheldon, he's just doodlin'
Get in here
Let's go, baby We're losing daylight
As you know,
several weeks ago in our first encounter,
we may have gotten off on the wrong foot
when I called you an idiot
And I just wanted to say that I was wrong
to point it out
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced
Sheldon's mom
Now, that's impossible! You must have had him when you were a teenager
Oh, aren't you sweet His father's dead
- Recently? - Long enough
Please
Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?
Hey, how did it go?
I got my job back
Really? What happened?
I'm not quite sure
It involves a part of the human experience
that has always eluded me
That narrows it down
I'm very proud of you honey
You showed a lot of courage today
Thanks, Mom
Is Dr Gablehauser going to be my new daddy?
We'll see
Sleep tight
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
All right! I'm moving my infantry division
Augmented by bataillon of orcs from Lord of the Rings
We flank the Tennessee volunteers
and the North, once again, wins the battle of Gettysburg
Not so fast!
Remember, the South still has two infantry divisions,
plus Superman and Godzilla
No, orcs are magic Superman is vulnerable to magic
Not to mention you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk
Why don't you just have Robert E Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?
- You guys ready to order? - Hang on, honey
Shiva and Ganesh,
the Hindu gods, against the entire Union army?
And orcs
I'll be back
Excuse me
Ganesh is the Remover of Obstacles and Shiva is the Destroyer
When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi
and drinking mint juleps
My boss says you have to either order or leave and never come back
What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite
from a morning of weight training and cardio funk?
A shower
I'll take the Heart Smart platter
All right, thank you, and Sheldon?
We don't eat here I don't know what's good
- It's all good - Statistically unlikely
Just get a hamburger You like hamburgers
I like hamburgers where we usually have them
You can't make the assumption that I'll like them here
I'm sorry
- Give him a hamburger - Which one?
The Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger,
the Barbecue Burger, or the Kobe Burger?
Can't we just go to Big Boy?
They only have one burger the Big Boy
The Barbecue Burger's like the Big Boy
Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy,
why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?
Because you're not at Big Boy!
- Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger - Make it two
Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy
Hey, Leonard Hi, guys
Hi, Leslie
I didn't know you ate here
We don't This is a disturbing aberration
Leslie, this is Penny
She lives across the hall from Sheldon and me
And walks in quiet beauty like the night
Howard, I've asked you not to do that
Leslie and I do research together at the university
Wow, a girl scientist
Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains
Glad I ran into you
The Physics Department string quartet needs a new cellist
What happened to Elliot Wong?
He switched over to high-energy radiation research,
had a little mishap, and now the other guys
are uncomfortable sitting next to him
- You're in? - Yeah, sure, why not?
Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place
Why at my place?
Department of Energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone
- Nice meeting you - Yeah, you, too
I didn't know you played the cello
Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard
and putting me in Advanced Placement classes
wasn't getting me beaten up enough
If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox
Really?
I'm actually not that into music
Your friend's really cute
Anything going on with you two?
Leslie?
No, no
- What, are you kidding? - He asked her out once
It was an embarrassing failure
- Thank you, Sheldon - I'm sorry
Was that supposed to be a secret?
That's too bad You guys'd make a cute couple
Oh, dear
- What's the matter? - She didn't take my order
How can she take your order when you're too neurotic to talk to her?
Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip
What did Penny mean, "You'd make a cute couple?"
I assume she meant the two of you together
would constitute a couple that others might consider cute
An alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation
is that you could manufacture one
As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb
Aren't they adorable?"
If Penny didn't know that Leslie had turned me down,
then it would unambiguously mean
that she, Penny, thought I should ask her, Leslie, out,
indicating that she had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out
But, because she did know that I had asked Leslie out
and that she, Leslie, had turned me down, then she, Penny,
could be offering consolation
"That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple,"
but while thinking: "Good, Leonard remains available"
You're a lucky man, Leonard
- How so? - You're talking to one of the three men
in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought
Well, what do you think?
I said I could follow it I didn't say I care
Season 1 Episode 5: The Hamburger Postulate
I admire your fingering
Thank you
Maybe sometime you can try that on my instrument
- G'night, guys Good job - Thanks
See you next week
- That was fun Thanks for including me - You're welcome
If you're up for it, we could practice that middle section again
Sure, why not?
Just so we're clear, you understand
that me hanging back to practice with you
is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available
Really?
Yeah, I'm good to go
I thought you weren't interested in me
That was before I saw you handling
that beautiful piece of wood between your legs
You mean my cello?
No, I mean the obvious, crude, double entendre
I'm seducing you
No kidding
What can I say? I'm a passionate and impulsive woman
So how about it?
Is it the waitress?
What about her?
I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her
Which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction
I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast
Which could cause a positive urine test for opiates,
but certainly not dilate my pupils
So I guess there was no point in bringing it up
You and the waitress then
No no
There's nothing going on between Penny and me
So you're open to a sexual relationship?
Yeah, yeah, I guess I am
- Good - Yeah, it is It is good
Did you want to start now?
Why don't we finish the section first?
A little musical foreplay Terrific
I'm good to go
Me, too
Hey, Sheldon What's going on?
I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics
I'm sorry?
Semiotics The study of signs and symbols
It's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics
Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaing yourself,
but you're really not
Just come with me
- Well? - Well, what?
What does it mean?
Oh, come on, you went to college
Yes, but I was 11
All right, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means
someone doesn't want to be disturbed
because, they're you know, gettin' busy
So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there?
Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack
and gotten really into Bryan Adams
Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast
We really shouldn't be standing here
This is very awkward
Oh, come on, Leonard's had girls over before, right?
Yes, but there's usually planning, courtship, advance notice
Last time, I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse
You had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?
I didn't have to The dates just happened to coincide
So, do you know who's in there?
Well, there's Leonard
And he's either with Leslie Winkle or a 1930s gangster
Good for him
Good for Leonard
Okay, g'night
No, no, wait, hold on
What's the matter?
I don't know what the protocol is here
Do I stay? Do I leave?
Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?
You're asking the wrong girl
I'm usually on the other side of the tie
Hi, Leonard?
It's me, Sheldon
In the living room
I just I wanted you to know I saw the tie
Message received
You're welcome
You carry on
Give my best to Leslie
Big Boy
Someone touched my board
Oh, God, my board!
Hey, what's the matter?
My equations, someone's tampered with my equations
- Are you sure? - Of course I am
Look at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics
The sign's been changed
Oh, yeah
But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Are you insane? Are you out of your mind?
Are you-- Look!
That fixes the problem I've been having
You're welcome
You did this?
I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water So I fixed it
Now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies
Pretty cool, huh?
"Cool"?
Listen, I've got to get to the lab Thanks for a great night
Thank you I'll see you at work
Hold on Hold on!
- What? - Who told you you could touch my board?
No one
I don't come into your house and touch your board
There are no incorrect equations on my board
Oh, that is so
so
Sorry, I've got to run If you come up with an adjective, text me
Inconsiderate
That is the adjective, "inconsiderate "
You can stare at your board all day She's still going to be right
I'm not staring, I'm hauling
So
how's it going?
Pretty good
Just pretty good? I'd think you were doing very good
Pretty, very there's really no objective scale
for delineating variations of "good" Why do you ask?
Well, a little bird told me
that you and Leslie hooked up last night
So, is it serious? Do you like her?
I don't
That's really two different questions
I'm not
Sheldon, we have to go!
You're wound awfully tight for a man who's just had sexual intercourse
All right, I'll talk to you later, but I am so happy for you
Thank you
What did she mean she's happy for me?
Is she happy that I'm seeing someone?
Or is she happy because she thinks that I am?
Because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy
Even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy
Because the second person, though happy,
is now romantically unavailable to the first person
Do you realize I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
You know what?
I'm being ridiculous
Who cares what Penny thinks?
Leslie is a terrific girl She's attractive
We like each other She's extremely intelligent
- She's not that intelligent - She fixed your equation
- She got lucky - You don't believe in luck
I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky
Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Leslie
I'm not going to pass that up
for some hypothetical future of happiness with a woman
who may or may not want me to be happy,
with a woman who is currently making me happy
I still don't care
Careful, Leonard Liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero
Why are you smashing a flash-frozen banana?
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife
So anyway
Hello
What are you doing?
Just extending the intimacy
Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab
and share a decontamination shower?
What exactly do you think's going on between us?
I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt
Listen, neither of us are neuroscientists,
but we both understand the biochemistry of sex
I mean, dopamine in our brains
is released across synapses, causing pleasure
You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button,
he'll push that thing until he starves to death
Well, who wouldn't?
Well, the only difference between us and the rat
is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus
That's where you come in
Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it
So what happens now?
I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Year's
- Thank you - Thank you
You want to make plans for New Year's?
Please You're smothering me
Look It's Dr Stud!
Dr What?
The blogosphere is a-buzzin' with news of you and Leslie Winkle
making eine kleine bang-bang musik 
How did it get on the Internet?
I put it there
How did you know about it?
A little bird told us
Apparently, you are a magnificent beast
That part's true
I think I may have misjudged this restaurant
- No kidding - I don't want to go out on a limb,
but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger
Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so brokenhearted
Way ahead of you I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays,
and just dropping Souplantation
Really?
The name always confused me anyway Souplantation
You can't grow soup
So, how's everything?
Terrific You'll be happy to know that I plan to come here
every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future
Really?
Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?
I don't know A psychiatrist?
So, hey,
how are things with you and Leslie?
To be honest, I don't think it's going to work out
Oh, that's too bad
Hey, don't worry
I'm sure there's someone out there who's just right for you
What did she mean by that?!
Was that just a generic platitude,
or was that a subtle bid for attention?
You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy?
This is a single-decker hamburger, whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker
This has a much more satisfying meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio
Are you even listening to me?
Of course, I'm listening Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion
Okay, then
You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Okay, if no one else was
We really sucked at paintball
Oh, that was absolutely humiliating
Oh, come on Some battles you win, some battles you lose
Yes, but but you don't have to lose to Kyle Burnsteen Barmistva party
I think we have to acknowledge,
those was some fairly savage preadolescent jews
No, we were annihilated by our own incompetence
and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command
Sheldon, let it go!
No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the ck
I shot you for good reason
You were leading us into disaster
I was giving clear, concise orders
You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke!
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"
Oh, hey, guys
- Oh, hey, Penny Hello - Morning, ma'am
So, how was paintball? Did you have fun?
Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun
You clear space on your calendar-- there will be an inquiry
Okay
Um, hey, I'm having a party on Saturday,
so if you guys are around, you should come on by
- A party? - Yeah
A "boy-girl" party?
Well, there will be boys and there will be girls and it is a party, so
It'll just be a bunch of my friends
We'll have some beer, do a little dancing
Dancing?
Yeah, I don't know, Penny
The thing is, we're not
- No, we're really more of a -No
But thanksThanks for thinking of us
Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween
A Halloween party?
As in costumes?
Well, yeah
Is there a theme?
Um, yeah, Halloween
Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre-specific?
As usual, I'm not following
He's asking if we can come as anyone from science fiction, fantasy
- Sure - What about comic books?
- Fine - Anime?
- Of course - TV, film,
D- and-D, manga, Greek gods, Roman gods, Norse gods--
Anything you want! Okay?
Any costume you want
Bye
Gentlemen, to the sewing machines
Season 1 Episode 6: The Middle Earth Paradigm
I'll get it
Oh, no
Oh, no
Make way for the fastest man alive!
Oh, no
See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting
We all have other costumes: We can change
Or we could walk right behind each other all night
and look like one person going really fast
No, no, no
It's a boy-girl party, this flash runs solo
Okay, how about this?
Nobody gets to be The Flash
We all change Agreed?
Agreed
I call Frodo!
Damn!
Hey
Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus
You went with Thor?
What, just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse god?
"No, no, Raj has to be an Indian god"
That's racism
I mean look at WolowitzHe's not English,
but he's dressed like Peter Pan
Sheldon is neither sound nor light,
but he's obviously the Doppler effect
I'm not Peter Pan
I'm Robin Hood
Really?
Because I sawPeter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby
She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man
Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party
I don't care if anybody gets it
I'm going as the Doppler effect
- No, it's not that - If I have to, I can demonstrate
Terrific
this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group,
and I need you not to embarrass me tonight
Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?
Well, for example, tonight,
no one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey
But there's nothing embarrassing about that
Your father worked with Louis Leakey,
a great anthropologist
It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting
All m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny
to see me as a member of her peer group,
a potential close friend, and perhaps more,
and I don't want to look like a dork
Just a heads up, fellas
If anyone gets lucky, I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver
Oh, hey, guys
Hey Sorry we're late
Late?
It's 7:05
And you said the party starts at 7:00
Well, yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7:00,
no one shows up at, you know, 7:00
It's 7:05
Yes Yes, it is
Okay Well, um, come on in
So, what, are all the girls in the bathroom?
Probably, but in their own homes
So, what time does the costume parade start?
The parade?
Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume
You know, most frightening, most authentic,
most accurate visualization of a scientific principal
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry,
but there aren't going to be any parades
or judges or prizes
This party is just going to suck
No! Come on, it's going to be fun,
and you all look great
I mean, look at you, Thor,
and, oh, Peter Pan
That's so cute
- Actually, Penny, he's Robin Hood - I'm Peter Pan
And I got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it
No, you don't
Uh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?
Oh, he's the Doppler effect
Yes It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave
caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer
Oh, sure, I see it now
The Doppler effect
All right, I got to shower
You guys, um, make yourselves comfortable
Okay
See?
People get it
By Odin's beard, this is good Chex mix
No, thanks Peanuts
I can't afford to swell up in these tights
I'm confused
If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?
We're socializing, meeting new people
Telepathically?
Oh, hey, when did you get here?
Hi
Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I've ever seen
And that includes Halle Berry's
She's not Catwoman She's just a generic cat
And that's the kind of sloppy costuming
which results from a lack of rules and competion
Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse
I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough
What is your move?
I'm going to use the mirror technique
She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back
She shrugs, I shrug
Subconsciously she's thinking, "We're in sync We belong together"
Where do you get this stuff?
You know, psychology journals, Internet research,
and there's this great show on VH-1 about how to pick up girls
Oh, if only I had his confidence
I have such difficulty speaking to women, or around women
or at times even effeminate men
If that's a working stethoscope,
maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat?
No, thanks
No, seriously, you canI have transient idiopathic arrhythmia
I want to get to know Penny's friends,
I just don't know how to talk to these people
Well, I actually might be able to help
How so?
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes,
I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured
But patterns emerge
They have their own language, if you will
Go on
Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting,
"How wasted am I?"
Which is met with an approving chorus of "Dude"
Then what happens?
That's as far as I've gotten
This is ridiculous
I'm jumping in
Good luck
No, you're coming with me
Oh, I hardly think so
Oh, come on
Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
Yes; but I need a wing man
All right, but if we're going to use flight metaphors,
I'm much more suited to being the guy
from the FAA analyzing wreckage
Hi
Hi Hello
So what are you supposed to be?
Me? I'll give you a hint
A choo-choo train?
Close!
A brain damaged choo-choo train?
How wasted am I?
I still don't get it
I'm the Doppler effect
Okay, if that's some sort of learning disability,
I think it's very insensitive
Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Because I'm Frodo
Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect
- Oh, no - What?
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend
What do you suppose he's doing here?
Besides disrupting the local gravity field
If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him
Oh, snap
So, I guess we'll be leaving now
Why should we leave?
For all we know he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here
You have a backup hypothesis?
Maybe they want to be friends
Or maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more
Then he and I are on equal ground
Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is
Look, if this was 1, 500 years ago,
by virtue of his size and strength,
Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners
And male partners, animal partners,
large primordial eggplants--
pretty much whatever tickled his fancy
Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift
In the Information Age, Sheldon,
you and I are the alpha males
We shouldn't have to back down
True
Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?
No
I'm going to assert my dominance face-to-face
Face-to-face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down,
or are you going to stand on the coffee table?
Hello, Penny
Hello, Kurt
Oh, hey, guys, are you having a good time?
Given the reaction to my costume,
this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system
What, you're a zebra, right?
Yet another child left behind
And what are you supposed to be, an elf?
No, I'm a hobbit
What's the difference?
A hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth,
whereas an elf is an immortal, tall warrior
So why the hell would you want to be a hobbit?
Because he's neither tall nor immortal
and none of us could be The Flash
Well, whatever
Why don't you go hop off on a quest?
I'm talking to Penny here
I think we're all talking to Penny here
I'm not No offense
Okay, maybe you didn't hear me
- Go away - All right, Kurt, be nice
Oh, I am being nice
Right, little buddy?
- Kurt - Okay
I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me
I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level
so you're driven to animalistic puffery
You calling me a puffy animal?
Of course not No, he's not
You're not, right, Leonard?
No, I said "animalistic"
Of course we're all animals,
but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree
If he understands that, you're in trouble
So, what, I'm unevolved?
You're in trouble
You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf
Okay, Kurt, please
Penny, it's okay I can handle this
I am not a dwarf,
I'm a hobbit
A hobbit
Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion
from short-term to long-term memory?
Okay, now you're starting to make me mad
A homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
What?
I think I've made my point
Yeah? How about I make a point out of your pointy little head?
Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute,
in a physical confrontation, I will be less than useless
There's not going to be a confrontation
In fact, I doubt if he can even spell "confrontation"
C- O-N
frontation!
Kurt, put him down this instant!
He started it!
I don't care I'm finishing itPut him down!
Fine
You're one lucky little leprechaun
He's a hobbit!
I got your back
Leonard, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine
It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us
It's just getting a little late, so
Oh, okay
All right, well, thank you for coming
Happy Halloween
If it's any consolation,
I thought that homo habilis line really put him in his place
What's that?
Tea
When people are upset,
the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages
There, there
You want to talk about it?
- No - Good
"There, there" was really all I had
Good night, Sheldon
Good night, Leonard
Hey, Leonard?
Hi, Penny
Hey, I just wanted to make sure you were okay
I'm fine
I am so sorry about what happened
It's not your fault
Yes, it is
That's why I broke up with him
He always does stuff like that
So why was he at your party?
Well, I ran into him last week and he was just all apologetic about how he's changed
And he was just going on and on and
I believed him and I'm an idiot
because I always believe guys like that
And I can't go back to my party because he's there
And know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset
and I'm really drunk and I just want to
There, there
God, what is wrong with me?
Nothing, you're perfect
I'm not perfect
Yes, you are
You really think so, don't you?
Penny?
Yeah?
How much have you had to drink tonight?
Just a lot
Are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with Kurt
doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?
It might
Boy, you're really smart
Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius
Leonard, you are so great
Why can't all guys be like you?
Because if all guys were like me,
the human race couldn't survive
I should probably go
Probably
Thank you
That's right, you saw what you saw
That's how we roll in the Shire
Coming
Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?
He's not here
Maybe the Avengers summoned him
He's not the Marvel Comics Thor, he's the original Norse god
Thank you for the clarification
I'm supposed to give him a ride home
Well, I'm sure he'll be fine
He has his hammer
I have to say, you are an amazing man
You're gentle, and passionate
And, my God, you are such a good listener
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Watch this, it's really cool
Call Leonard Hoffstadder
Did you say: "Call Hellen Boxlightner? 
Call Leonard Hoffstadder
Did you say: "Call Temple Badsaidor?" 
Let me try!
Call
Calling "Rajesh Koothrappali" 
That's very impressive
And a little racist
If we're all through playing "mock the flawed technology,"
can we get on with Halo night?
We were supposed to start at 8:00 It is now 8:06
So we'll start now
First we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming
out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break
We could split it two, two and two
If we're having anchovies on the pizza, we can't take it out of bathroom time
Oh, what fresh hell is this?
- Hey, Penny Come on in - Hey, guys
See a Penny, pick her up,
and all the day you'll have good luck
No, you won't
Can I hide out here for a while?
Sure What's going on?
There's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christy
She called me up, and she's like, "Hey, how's California?"
And I'm like, "Awesome," 'cause, you know, it's not Nebraska
And the next thing I know
she's invited herself out here to stay with me
8:08
Anyway, she got here today and she's just been in my apartment
yakity yakking about every guy she slept with in Omaha,
which is basically every guy in Omaha,
and washing the sluttiest
collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink
Is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she throw it all in
like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?
- He really needs to dial it down - I know
So if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
She was engaged to my cousin
while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family
I apologize for my earlier outburst
Who needs Halo , when we can be regaled
with the delightfully folksy tale of the Whore of Omaha?
I don't think she's a whore
No, yeah, she's definitely a whore
I mean, she has absolutely no standards
This one time she was at
Where's Howard?
Bonjour, mademoiselle I understand you're new in town
Oh, good grief
Subtitles: swsubcom
I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment
And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes,
but on a more serious note,
it's 8:13 and we're still not playing Halo 
Fine We'll just play one-on-one until he gets back
One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one We play teams, not one-on-one
One-on-one
The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half
Sure, cut the foreigner in half
There's a billion more where he came from
If you guys need a fourth, I'll play
- Great idea - No
The wheel was a great idea,
relativity was a great idea
This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that
Why?
Why?
Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny
What, what, what?
This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve
There are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies
to master, not to mention an extremely intricate backstory
Oh cool Whose head did I just blow off?
Mine
Okay, I got this Lock and load, boys
It's the only way we can play teams
Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung
by her lack of experience, and not to mention the fact
There goes your head again
It's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just re-spawned
You need to to give them a chance to Now, come on!
Raj, Raj! She's got me cornered Cover me!
Cover this, suckers!
- Penny, you are on fire! - Yes, and so is Sheldon
Okay, that's it I don't know how, but she is cheating
No one can be that attractive and this skilled at a video game
Wait, Sheldon, come back You forgot something
What?
This plasma grenade
Look, it's raining you
You laugh now-- you just wait until you need tech support
Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?
To be fair, he's also a rather unpleasant winner
Well, it's been fun
We make such a good team
Maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime
Or we could just have a life
I guess for you that's an option
- Good night - Good night
As usual, nice talking to you, Raj
What do you suppose she meant by that?
She's an enigma, Raj
And another thing-- there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny,
- a well- established - She's gone
She could have said good-bye
Okay, I have a problem
It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it
What's wrong?
Howard and Christy are
kind of hooking up in my bedroom
Are you sure?
I grew up on a farm, okay?
From what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine
Do you mind if I stay here tonight?
No, take the couch, or my bed
I just got new pillows Hypo-allergenic
The couch is good
Hold that thought Leonard, a moment
Let me guess You have a problem with this
- Where do I begin? - It's up to you Crazy person's choice
First, we don't have houseguests
Frankly, if I could afford the rent, I'd ask you to leave
Your friendship means a lot to me as well What else?
Well
our earthquake supplies We have a two-man, two-day kit
So?
So if there's an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here,
we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon
I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay
we might succumb to cannibalism?
No one ever thinks it'll happen until it does
If you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones
while we sleep, you can stay
- What? - He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum
It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument
to ridiculous proportions and then criticizing the result
And I do not appreciate it
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow
Okay, since I'm obviously being ignored here,
let's go over the morning schedule
I use the bathroom from 7:00 to 7:20
Plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly
How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
I suggest no liquids after 11:00 pm
- Here you go - Thanks, Leonard
Wrong
I'm listening
Your head goes on the other end
- Why? - It's culturally universal A bed,
even a temporary bed,
is always oriented with the headboard away from the door
It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders
I'll risk it
Anything else should I know?
Yes, if you use my toothbrush,
I'll jump out that window
Please don't come to my funeral Have a good night
Sorry about that
- That's okay - FYI--
his toothbrush is the red one in the Plexiglas case under the UV light
Got it
- Sleep tight - Thanks
Funny expression, "sleep tight"
It refers to the early construction of beds
which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes,
which would occasionally
Sleep tight
What are you doing?
Every Saturday since we've lived in this apartment
I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal,
added a quarter cup of two percent milk,
sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America,
and watched Doctor Who 
Penny's still sleeping
Every Saturday since we've lived in this apartment
I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl
I know You have a TV in your room
Why don't you just have breakfast in bed?
Because I am neither an invalid, nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day
What time is it?
Almost 6:30
I slept all day?
No, it's 6:30 in the morning
What the hell is your problem?
Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity
I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste
Hola, nerd-migos
Why do you people hate sleep?
Are you wearing my robe?
Yeah Sorry, I'll have it cleaned
That's okay, keep it
- Where's Christy? - In the shower
By the way, where did you get that loofah mitt?
Yours reaches places that mine just won't
You used my loofah?
More precisely, weused your loofah
I exfoliated her brains out
You can keep that, too
Then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection
In here, milady!
Here's my little engine that could
There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again
Hi Christy
- I'm Sheldon - Right
You're Howard's entourage
So, Christy, what are your plans?
Howard said he'd take me shopping in Beverly Hills
Yeah, no, I meant plans to find someplace to live
Other than with me Not that I don't love having you,
but it's It's a little crowded
Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us
Oh, terrific Now we're running a cute little B & B
Let me offer a little outside-the-box thinking here
Why doesn't Christy stay with me?
- You live with your mother - I do not
My mother lives with me
Then it's all settled Christy will stay with Howard,
Penny can go back to her apartment,
and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who 
Although at this point, it's more like Doctor Why Bother ?
- Sheldon, you just can't dictate - No more talking! Everybody go!
So what do you say? Want to repair to Casa Wolowitz?
What is that, like a Mexican deli?
I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier
My last name is Wolowitz
That's so cool
My first Jew
I imagine there aren't very many Kosher Cornhuskers
But you're still taking me shopping?
Anything you want
Okay, I'll go pack my stuff
When they perfect human cloning, I'm going to order 12 of those
Can't you see she's using you?
Who cares? Last night, she pulled off her blouse and I wept
I know her Okay? She'll have sex with anyone,
as long as they keep buying her things
- Really? - Yeah
If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar Mitzvah bonds to cash
I'm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz
We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
Let me walk you through it Our standard order is:
the steamed dumpling appetizer, General Tso's chicken,
beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce
and vegetable lo mein
Do you see the problem?
I see a problem
Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees
divided amongst four people
- So, we'll just order three entrees - Fine
What do you want to eliminate? And who gets the extra dumpling?
We could cut it into thirds
Then it's no longer a dumpling Once you cut it open it is,
at best, a very small open-faced sandwich
Hi, fellas
Where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?
He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good
Where he comes from, that's punishable by death
I come from Sacramento
Can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four?
No substitutions
This isn't a substitution It's a reduction
Okay No reductions
Fine Bring us three orders of dumplings
- That's 12 We'll each have four - That works
If we fill up on dumplings, we need to eliminate another entree
No eliminations
If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home
And divide it how? I'm telling you, we cannot do this without Wolowitz
Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend
If you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth
Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food?
She uses a fork and she double-dips her egg rolls
- We don't order egg rolls - Exactly,
but we'd have to if she was here!
Can we please make a decision?
Not only are there children starving in India,
there's an Indian starving right here
There's an idea Why don't we just go out for Indian food?
You're nice boys
Tell you what I'm going to do
I'm going to bring you the four dumplings
When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped,
one of the dumplings fall to the floor No one has to know
I'll know
- How about soup? - Yeah, we can always divide soup
What about the wontons?
Hey, guys, what's up?
It's Halo night
So?
With Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy
She's not my friend Friends do not get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty
Right Anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere,
we had something we wanted to ask you
Yes
We would very much appreciate it
if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team
I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is
That's so sweet, but I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend
You can't go out; it's Halo night
- Well, for Penny, it's dancing night - You go dancing every Wednesday?
- No - Then that's not "dancing night"
Why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?
Tonight is Halo night It's like talking to a wall
All right, now, Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this
Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational
All right, fellas, I gotta go
But good luck
Maybe we should've asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend
Assuming we could dance-- which we can't--
there are three of us and two of them
So?
It's the Chinese restaurant all over again
I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds
is child's play compared with three men
each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman
For God's sakes, Sheldon, you're driving me crazy!
Your anger is not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics
I'm pretty sure my anger is with you
What's happening to us? We're falling apart
- Who are you calling? - The only man who can restore
any semblance of balance to our universe
Hi, this is Howard Wolowitz 
And this is Christy Vanderbelt 
We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex! 
You're not going to put that on your message, are you? 
Nah, I'm just kidding I'll re-record it 
Sheldon, think this through You're going to ask Howard to choose
between sex and Halo 
No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo Three 
As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded
to include Hi-Def graphics and enhanced weapon systems
You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact
My point
You can take the damn plastic off the couch once in a while!
Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?!
Ladies, ladies, I'm sure there's a middle ground
Shut up, Howard!
You guys talk I'm gonna take my scooter out for a little spin
You happy? You drove your own son out of the house
Why don't you stop
What are you doing here?
It's Halo night
He's not a man, he's a putz!
And don't you take that tone with me, you gold digger!
- What'd you call me? - You heard me!
And I'll tell you something else, you're barking up the wrong tree
'Cause as long as you're around, Howard is out of the will!
You know what? I got better offers I'm outta here
That's right Go back to Babylon, you whore!
So, Halo night, huh?
I thought she was the whore of Omaha
Sheldon, you got him in your sights! Fire! He's charging his plasma rifle!
I can't shoot now I'm cloaking!
- Raj! Kill Sheldon! - I can't see him!
That's why they call it cloaking, dead man!
- Start throwing grenades! - I'm all out!
Hey, guys My friends and I got tired of dancing,
so we came over to have sex with you
Raj, hop in the tank!
- We said no tanks! - There are no rules in hell!
Son of a bitch Med pack! I need a med pack!
Told ya
There's a sniper Use your rocket launcher!
All I've got is a Needler and I'm all out of ammo!
And now you're out of life
Why'd you hit pause?
I thought I heard something
What?
No, never mind Sorry Go
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Damn you, walletnookcom!
Problem?
The online description was completely misleading
They said: "8 slots plus removable ID"
To any rational person, that would mean room for nine cards
But they don't tell you the removable ID takes up one slot It's a nightmare
Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of American membership card?
It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five
Why?
It says, "Keep this on your person at all times"
It's right here under Batman's signature
and this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment
Guess whose parents just got broadband
Leonard, may I present, live from New Delhi,
Dr and Mrs V M Koothrappali
Hi! Tilt up the camera up! 
I'm looking at his crotch 
Sorry, Papa
Oh, that's much better Hi 
And over here is Sheldon
He lives with Leonard
That's nice Like Haroon and Tanvir 
Not like Haroon and Tanvir
Such sweet young men 
They just adopted the cutest little Punjabi baby 
No, we're not like Haroon and Tanvir
So, are you boys academics like our son? 
Yes
And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential? 
- Oh, yes - Not at all
Papa, please Don't start
It was just a question He's so sensitive 
That's my life That's my friends Good to see you Say good-bye
- Bye - Wait! Wait! 
Before you go, we have good news 
Put the computer down and gather your friends 
- What is it, Papa? - Friends! 
Is it just me, or does web chatting
with your clothes on seem a little pointless?
Do you rember Lalita Gupta? 
The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable?
Yes Well, now she's a dental student at USC, 
so we gave her your contact information 
Why did you do that?
You're 26 years old, Rajesh We want grandchildren 
- But, Papa, I'm not supposed - Lalita's parents approved the match 
If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid monsoon season 
A spring wedding?!
It's up to you, dear We don't want to meddle 
If you don't want to meddle, then why are you?
If I may, your parents probably don't consider this meddling
While arranged marriages are no longer the norm,
Indian parents continue to have
a greater-than-average involvement in their children's love lives
Why are you telling me about my own culture?
You seemed confused
Sorry, but with all due respect, I really don't want to
I'm sorry, darling We have to go 
Doogie Howser is on 
Grandma! It's Doogie Time! 
- Bye-bye! - Bye-bye! 
I don't believe it
Neither do I
Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years
Actually, I read somewhere
that it's one of the most popular programs in India
It might speak to a cultural aspiration
to have one's children enter the medical profession
I bet you're right
- I bet they loveScrubs - What's not to love?
Excuse me! Hello?
My parents are trying to marry me to a total stranger What am I going to do?
I suggest you go through with it
What?!
Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the 19th century
Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm,
and it served society quite well
It's the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof 
I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show
Me too Of course, it speaks to me culturally
Understandable, but there's a universality to that story
which transcends ethnicity
Let's not forget it's got some really catchy tunes
- I know what I'm going to do - What?
Find new friends
So who wants to rent Fiddler ?
No need, we have the special edition
Maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir
Subtitles: swsubcom
This is Dr Sheldon Cooper
Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium
Well, I'm sorry, too,
but there's just no room for you in my wallet
I understand,
but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History,
and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs
I'll miss you, too Bye-bye
Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to stop
Oh, dear, I am rightly and truly screwed
Hey, I thought you were finding new friends
I've got some feelers out
In the meantime, listen to this
Hi, Rajesh This is Lalita Gupta
Your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me
So, I'm calling you
and call me back Bye
Can you believe how pushy she is?
So don't call her
If I don't call her, I won't hear the end of it from my parents
- So call her - How?
You know I can't talk to women
I'm done Anybody else?
- Give me the phone - Why?
Just give it to me
- What are you doing? - Don't worry You'll thank me
Hello, Lalita? Raj Koothrappali here
Yes, it is good to talk to you, too
So what are you wearing?
Oh, not important
So, anyhow, when would you like to meet?
Friday works for me!
I'll call you with a time and place
But in the meantime, keep it real, babe
You may now thank me
For what? Making me sound like a Simpsons character?
Next time make your own date
- I didn't want this one! - Look on the bright side,
she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl
Great, then we'll get married, I won't be able to talk to her
and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence
It worked for my parents
Hi, guys
I need some guinea pigs
There's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try
But if your research is going to have human applications,
may I suggest white mice instead?
Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours
I swear to God, one day,
I'm going to get the hang of talking to you
His mom's been saying that for years
What's up?
I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bartending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks
Great The key to acquiring proficiency
in any task is repetition
With certain obvious exceptions
Suicide, for example
So, Leonard, how about it?
We'd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now,
besides, he doesn't drink, so
Really?
Raj is going through some stuff right now
and he'd like to take up drinking
Here you go, Leonard One Tequila Sunrise
Thank you
This drink is a wonderful example
of how liquids with different specific gravities
interact in a cylindrical container
Thank you
Okay, Raj, what'll it be?
Whatever you recommend
How about a Grasshopper? I make a mean Grasshopper
Okay? Good Coming up
Sheldon, what are you going to have?
I'll have a Diet Coke
Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks
Fine I'll have a Virgin Cuba Libre
That's, rum and Coke without the rum
Yes
So Coke
Yes
And would you make it diet?
There's a can in the fridge
A Cuba Libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge
Then swim to Cuba
Bartenders are supposed to have people skills
Raj, here you go
All right Who's next?
I'd like to try a Slippery Nipple
Okay, you're cut off
Anybody need a refill?
Where did my life go, Penny?
One day I'm a carefree bachelor, and the next I'm married
and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches
in suburban New Delhi
Are you talking to me?
Is the another Penny here?
I had such plans I had dreams
I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astrophysics
But with a penis, of course
- Amazing - Ever since I was a little boy,
my father wanted me to be a gynecologist like him
How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the eye!
You know what?
I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer
It's time for a showdown
Somebody give me a computer with a webcam!
Sweetie, I think that's the Grasshopper talking
And it's about to tell my parents
that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta
Okay, calm down
No one can make you get married
Why don't you just meet this girl and see what happens?
Haven't you been listening to me? I cannot talk to women
No, no, let's see how long it takes him
Raj, honey,
you say you can't talk to women, but you've been talking to me
And now we'll never know
You're right
I am talking to you
Hello, Penny, how are you?
- I'm fine - Okay, now I just need
to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the Grasshopper
It's a sweet, green miracle
If you're going to drink on this date, just promise me you won't overdo it
Overdo what?
Happiness?
Freedom?
This warm glow inside of me
that promises everything's going to be all hunky-dunky?
Yeah, that Why don't you bring her to my restaurant
while I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you
What's the plan here?
Let's say he meets her, he likes her, they get married
What's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?
Worked for my parents
I can't believe I'm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta
Well, you are
Little Lalita
That's kind of fun to say
Little Lalita, little Lalita, little Lalita
- You should try it - Oh, it's okay
You have lost so much weight
That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat
Do you remember?
Yes, I do
Of course you do Who could forget being that fat?
I've been trying
So you're a dental student
Are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate?
Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers,
but there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers,
so in pure numbers, you're still winning
Yay, me
Do you have a drink that will make him less obnoxious?
Drinks do not work that way
I'd say he's doing fine Look at her
The last girl my mom set me up with had a mustache and a vestigial tail
- Sorry I'm late - What happened?
Nothing I just really didn't want to come
Virgin diet Cuba Libre, please
In a tall glass with a lime wedge
Oh, I'll wedge it right in there
So how's Koothrappali
Oh, my Lord
- What? - That's Princess Panchali
I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita
No, no, Princess Panchali, fromThe Monkey and the Princess
Oh, yeah I tried to watch that online, but they wanted my credit card
It's a children's story
Oh, no, it isn't
When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read it to me
It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey
who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different
For some reason, I related to it quite strongly
I know the reason
We all know the reason
Sheldon, what are you getting at?
That woman looks exactly like the pictures
of Princess Panchali in the book
How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
Every year at Comic-Con
Every day at Disneyland
You can hire Snow White to come to your house
Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid
Hey, guys This is Lalita Gupta
Lalita, this is Leonard
and Sheldon and Howard and Penny
Isn't it great? She isn't fat anymore
"Forgive me, Your Highness, for I am but a monkey,
"and it is in my nature to climb
"I did not mean to gaze upon you
as you comb your hair"
I'm sorry?
You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Panchali
Oh, no kidding
Who is that?
A beloved character from an Indian folktale
Us Indian or "Come to our casino" Indian?
You Indian
The resemblance is remarkable
I can practically smell the lotus blossoms
woven into your ebony hair
Well, thanks
I imagine you smell very nice, too
I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can
Really? So do I
But you're a dentist He's nuts
Don't be insulting, Rajesh
So, Sheldon,
tell me more about this princess you say I look like
It was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars
and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips
- Oh, my - Back off, Sheldon
What?
If you do not stop hitting on my lady, you'll feel the full extent of my wrath
I'm not hitting on her
And I am not your lady
And you have no wrath
You are my lady Our parents said so
We are, for all intents and purposes, 100% hooked up
Let's get something straight here
The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case
I certainly don't need to be getting this Old World crap from you
That's exactly the kind of spirit
with which Princess Panchali led the monkeys to freedom
- Screw Princess Panchali - You can't talk to me like that
But you're not Princess Panchali
Luckily for you-- she could have you beheaded
Sheldon, are you hungry?
- I could eat - Let's go
What just happened?
Beats the hell out of me
I'll tell you what happened I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks
What are we supposed to say to Lalita's parents? 
I play golf with her father I won't be able to look at him 
Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa
Oh, now you're a funny man 
This is not funny, Mr Funny Man 
Dr and Mrs Koothrappali,
in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault
This is a family matter, Sheldon 
I'm Leonard
Sorry You all look alike to us
But he's right, Papa Listen to him
You! You are the one who ruined everything
Who is it? We can't see 
Turn us Turn us! 
Go ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren
How would I know? Do you have a low sperm count?
This has nothing to do with my sperm count
You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren't you? 
- Yes, Mumi - Because you know what happens 
to the samosas when you wear tighty-whities 
Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
Sheldon, tell them what you did
What did I do?
You left with his date
Friends don't do that to each other
All right, noted
Sorry
Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?
Take it It's more than I've ever gotten
May I point out,
she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring
- Drunk? - And boring-- her words
I knew it He moves to America and he becomes an alcoholic 
I'm not an alcoholic
Then why were you drunk? 
- It was just this one time, I swear - Are you in denial? 
Do we have to come over and do an intervention? 
Don't embarrass him in front of his friends 
All right Carry us outside 
We want to talk to you in private 
- But, Papa, please - Now, Rajesh! 
I have to go
Now, listen to me
At least wait till I get into the hall
Okay, well, good night
Hold on
What happened with you and Lalita?
We ate, she lectured me
on the link between gum disease and heart attacks--
nothing I didn't already know-- and I came home
So you're not going to see her again?
Why would I see her again?
I already have a dentist
I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren?
I don't believe it What's gotten into him?
Oh, maybe a couple virgin Cuba Libres
that turned out to be kind of slutty
You didn't
You do your experiments I do mine
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Ok
The X10's are online
Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP
racing down fibre optic cable at the speed of light to San Fransisco,
bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal,
where the data packets will be headed off to submerge transatlantic cables,
terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia
and transfered across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP
And the extend receiver attached to this
Lamp
Look at me, look at me I've got goosebumps
- Are we ready for the stereo? - Go for stereo
- Hey guys - Hello
It's a little loud
No problem Turning it down
San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax  et voil?
- OK, thanks - Hang on, hang on Do you not realise what we just did?
Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop
No, we turned our stereo down, by sending a signal around the world via the Internet
Oh You know you can get one of those universal remotes from Radioshack?
They're really cheap
No, you don't get it Howard,
- Enable public access - Public access enabled
- Boy, that's terrific I'll see ya - No hang on, hang on
See?
No
Someone in Sichuan province, China, is using his computer
to turn our lights on and off
Oh, that's handy
Here's a question Why?
Because we can
They found our remote control cars!
- Wait, what's on top of that? - Wireless webcams, wave hello!
The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas,
and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv
- You may want to put on slacks - What?
Ew, stop it! No! Leave me alone!
- Who's running the red Corvette? - That would be me
Season 1 Episode 9: The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization
You know in the future, when we're disembodied brains in jars,
we're going to look at this as eight hours well wasted
I don't want to be in a jar I want my brain in an android body
Eight feet tall and ribbed
I'm with you
I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish
I promised my mother
I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised
But that's something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer
Not to mention you'd have to power down on saturdays
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Well, there's always the possibility that
a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter
but Occam's rasor would suggest that someone threw it out
It's from the Institute of Experimental Physics, they want us to
present our paper on the properties of supersolids
at the topical conference of Bose-Einstein condensates
I know I read it before I threw it out
Ok, if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question:
why did you throw it out?
Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose room of the Pasadena Marriot,
in front of a group of judgmental strangers
who wouldn't recognise true genius if it was standing in front of them giving a speech
Which if I were there, would be
I don't know Sheldon
Those topical conferences on Bose-Einstein condensates' parties are legendary
- Forget the parties! - Forget the parties? What a nerd
Are there any other honours I've got that I don't know about?
Did the UPS dropped off a Nobel prize with my name on it?
Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel prize,
is the day I begin my research on the drag coefficient of tassles on flying carpets
The only thing missing from that insult was: "your mama"
I got one Hey Leonard,
- Your mama's research methodology is so flawed - Shut up, Howard
- Sheldon, we have to do this - No, we don't
We have to take a nourishment, to expel waste,
and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying
Everything else is optional
Ok, let me put it this way: I'm doing it
You can't I'm the lead author
Come on, the only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically
I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you
the humiliation with dealing with the fact that it was my idea
Now to put too fine a point to it, but I was throwing you a bone
You're welcome
Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis
That doesn't mean proving
So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
They're not supposed to, but they should
Alright, I don't care what you say
I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings
And I forbid it
You forbid it?
If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is
- So, you admit that it's our work - No
Once again, I'm throwing you a bone
And once again, you are welcome
So, how's it going with Sheldon? Are you guys still not talking to each other?
Not only is he still not talking to me,
but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode
You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie "Scanners"?
Like  Bzzz
Nevermind
How about this one?
It says, I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy
Oh, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits
They don't, that's why I saved this one
Ok, well, let's just see what else you have
Ok, here Take this
And this, and this, and this, and these
Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out
Seriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone
What's this?
That's the bottled city of Kandor
You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton
It was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded
and then rescued by Superman
Oh, nice
It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it
Here, why don't you put these while I find a shirt and a sport cut match
Right, be right back
Where are you going? Just put them on
Here?
Oh, are you shy?
- No, I'm not shy - Don't worry I won't look
I know you won't look Why would you look?
There's nothing to see Well, not 'nothing'
Sweetie, put the pants on
So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could
- compromise on this whole presentation thing? - No, No
Scientists do not compromise
Our minds are trained to synthetize facts
and come to inarguable conclusions
Not to mention, Sheldon is back-crap crazy
What is this?
Oh, careful
That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit
Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit
Ok, alright, moving on
Oh, wow A paisley shirt
It goes with my corduroy suit
If you mean it should end up in the same place, then I agree
Is this your only tie?
Technically, yes But, if you'll notice
It's reversible!
So it works as two
Sweetie, I don't even think it works as one
- Is this all your clothes? - Eh, yeah
Everything since the eighth grade
- The eighth grade? - My last growth sprout
Ok, well, let's go back to the curdoroy suit
- Great - Yeah
I said no Put it down
Hey Sheldon
Hello Penny
Get anything good?
Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly
Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't
It was a joke
Yep
Tip you waitresses I'm here all week
Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness,
know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence
Oh, yeah ok, me too Zip it, lock it
Put it in your pocket
- So, you and Leonard - Oh dear God
Little misunderstanding, huh?
A little misunderstanding ?
Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding
Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it
How do you feel?
I don't understand the question
I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend
I haven't thought about it like that
I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations
of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil
Wait, what?
I couldn't poop this morning
You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out
- Certainly preferable to my plan - Which was?
A powerful laxative
You absolutely should talk to him
Look, I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself
without your little idea there's no way he could come up with this whole experiment thing
Excuse me "Little idea"?
Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me,
- I didn't really understand it but - Of course you didn't
He said: "Little idea"?
Oh, well, no Not
- Not in those words - In what words then, exactly?
Oh, you know Gee The exact words are It's more the spirit in which he said
- What did he say? - You had a lucky hunch
Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this
Don't you ever speak to me again
What ?
Ok, I'm leaving for the conference
Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch"
Shel, I didn't mean it like that
- Then why did you say it? - I don't know, I wasn't
- Were you trying to impress Penny? - No, no, not at all A little bit
How did that work out for you?
- Leonard, ready to go? - Libido: 1 Truth: 0
Ok, I'm gonna ask you one more time
We did the work together, let's present the paper together
And I'm telling you for the last time,
it's pandering, it's undignifying, and bite me
Let's go
- Bye Sheldon - Goodbye Penny
One of these days bshh!
There you go
You're right this side does look better
No, no, I didn't say better, I said "less stained"
I just checked the house There's probably 20-25 people in there
- You're kidding! - Is that all?
"All? " In particle physics 25 is Woodstock!
- Then good! - I wasn't expecting such a crowd,
I'm all nervous
It's ok, just open with a joke, you'll be fine
A joke Ok
How about this? Um, ok
There's this farmer
and he has these chickens but they won't lay any eggs, so
He calls a physicist to help
The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says: "I have a solution,
but it only works for spherical chickens in a vacuum"
Right?
Oh, sorry, I just had heard it before
- Let's roll Hey, nice suit - It's a classic, right?
I really should have brought my own car
So, in conclusion,
the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero,
the moment of inertia changes, and a solid becomes a supersolid,
which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter
Thank you!
- Are there any questions? - Yeah
What the hell was that?
Any other questions?
Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper
Thank you
And you sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park
and I saw these children on a merry-go-round which started me thinking
about the moment of inertia in gases like helium
at temperatures approaching absolute zero
I didn't skip it It's just an anecdote, it's not science
Oh, I see It was the apple falling on Newton's head,
- was that just an anecdote? - You are not Isaac Newton
No, no, that's true Gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple
You cannot possibly be that arrogant
You continue to underestimate me, my good man
Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me!
As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you,
I don't need validation from lesser minds
No offense
Really, so why did you come?
Because I knew you'd screw this up
I didn't screw it up!
Oh, please I admit that spherical chicken joke,
- that was hilarious - Thank you
But it was straight downhill from there
I've had enough of your condescendship
Maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you
Maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16
but you are not the only person who is smarter than
everyone else in this room!
No offense
And I am clearly not the only person
who is tormented by insecurity
and has an ego in need of constant validation!
So you admit you're an egotist?
Yes!
My name is doctor Leonard Hofstadter and I can never please my parents so
I need all my self esteem from strangers like you!
But he's worse!
Ok, that's it!
Stop it!
You cannot blow up my head with your mind!
Then I'll settle for your aneurism!
- Stop it! - You hit me!
You saw that he hit me!
You tried to blow up my head!
So it was working!
It wa It was not! You're a nutcase!
We'll see about that!
Heads up, you people in the front row!
This is a splash zone!
Stop it!
Just quit it!
Is this usually how these physics things go?
More often than you think
You could have offered me a ride home
You're lucky I didn't run you over
I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about
You begged me to come, I came
There's just no pleasing you
You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help
Well, that's not much of an apology but I'll take it
Excuse me,
is there anything you would apologise for?
Yes
I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head
It was uncalled for
You won't believe this
Somebody got the whole thing with their cell phone and put it on YouTube!
What?
- Who would do that? - That would be me
Hey, check it out, it's a featured video!
He hit me! You saw that he hit me!
- Then it was working! - It was not working! You're a nutcase!
We will see about that!
You people in the front row heads up!
This is splash zone
Stop it! Leave it, leave it!
You want a volcano nerve pinch!
You should clip your fingernails! Those hurt!
Oh, Jeez does this suit really look that bad?
Forget your suit, look at my arms waving
I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin
Howard,
would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page
has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned
"me and my girlfriend"?
Uh oh, here comes the talk
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
No, see, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet,
and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson,
but that future no longer exists due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2 
Okay, then riddle me this:
Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet
but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor,
why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?
Skynet is kinky?
I don't know
Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes
Allright Wait! They use it to
Too late I win
What the hell is that?
I don't know, but if cats could sing
they'd hate it, too
Hey, guys!
- Hi! Where you going?
- What?
We just had to mail some letters
and
throw away some chicken
You'll never guess what just happened
I give up
I don't guess
As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation
Although as I'm saying this,
it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot
- What was that?
- Believe it or not, personal growth
What happened?
Allright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent ,
but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why
I have a conclusion based on an observation
No, you don't
No, he doesn't
Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi
she dropped out, and they asked me to replace her
Congratulations
What a lucky break
It's not a big deal, just a one-night showcase,
but they invite a lot of casting people and agents
So, you never know
- I think I know
- No, you don't
He doesn't
It's this Friday at 8:00
Do you guys want to come?
No!
Because
Friday we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium
I think that's a week from Tuesday, at 6:00
No, it's this Friday
At 8:00
Oh, too bad
I gotta get to rehearsal
- See you guys - See ya
You just lied to Penny
- Yes, I did
- And you did it so casually-- no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration
So?
So, lack of a physiological response while lying
is characteristic of a violent sociopath
Sheldon, are you worried about your safety?
No, I imagine if you were going to kill me,
you'd have done it a long time ago
That's very true
Season 1 Episode 10: The Loobenfeld Decay
Leonard?
What?
I need to speak to you
- It's 2:00 in the morning!
- It's important
I highly doubt that
Go away!
Are you still out there?
Yes
What?
You're right; it can wait until morning
- What, what, what, what, WHAT?
- Never mind
I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle
You're in no state of mind to talk
Sheldon, what is it?
I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny
What was I supposed to say?
- You could have told her the truth
- That would have hurt her feelings
Is that a relevant factor?
Yes!
Then I suppose you could've agreed to go
And what would I have said afterwards?
I would suggest something to the effect of:
singing isneither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you,
and if you disagree, I'd recommend you have a CAT scan to look for a tumor
pressing on the cognitive processing centers of your brain
I couldn't say that I would have to say,
"You were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again"
Why?
It's the social protocol
It's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at
I was not aware of that
Well, now you are
Oh! All right
Leonard?
Yes?
When we played chess earlier, you were terrific,
and I can't wait to play you again
Good night
Leonard?
This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath
What?
I was analyzing our lie,
and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse
How?
Simple: If she were to log onto "wwwsocalphysixs-grouporg/activities/other"
click on "Upcoming Events," scroll down to "Seminars,"
download the PDF schedule,
and look for the seminar on molecular positronium,
well then Bippity, boppity, boo--
our pants are metaphorically on fire
Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today
Penny?
Good morning!
Do you have any idea what time it is?
Of course I do
My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado
It's accurate to one tenth of a second
But as I'm saying this, it occurs to me
that, once again, your question may have been rhetorical
What do you want?
Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance
because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
I remember "symposium"
Yes Well
He lied
Wait What?
He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it
Well, imagine how I'm feeling
Hungry?
Tired?
I'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit
You told her I lied?
Why would you tell her I lied?
To help you
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help
She was going to see through your lie eventually,
so I told her that you were lying to protect me
I'm getting a bad feeling
Hunger?
Indigestion?
I'm sorry, I'm really not very good at this
Anyway, Penny now believes that, on Friday night,
we're going to participate in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention
Your cousin Leopold
Who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee
- Remember that It's important
- What's important?
Details, Leonard-- the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details
- Do you have a cousin Leopold?
- No I made him up
I think you'd call him Lee
I don't get it I already told her a lie
Why replace it with a different lie?
Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent,
where mine is exquisitely convoluted
While you were sleeping, I was weaving an un-unravelable web
Un-unravelable?
Yes
If she Googles "Leopold Houston," she'll find a Facebook page,
an online blog depicting his descent into drug use
and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eHarmonycom
Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousin?
Because it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive
- We're going to Long Beach?
- Of course not
There's no cousin Leo
There's no intervention
Focus, Leonard
Aw, come on
We just leave the house on Friday night and we return in the wee hours,emotionally wrung out,
from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab
- He goes back into rehab?
- Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to hear her sing again
You still told her I lied
For a noble purpose-- to spare me the social embarrassment
of having a drug-addled first cousin--
which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
How am I supposed to remember all of this?
That's the best part
You don't have to
I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied,
so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie is still in force
So she's expecting me, to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena,
when, in actuality, we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach
Un-unravelable
Hey Penny! Wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase
- You look great
- Thanks
I just wanted to come by, wish you guys luck
with your symposium
Thank you!
I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone,
but that's not who you are
You are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when
When he has a symposium to go to
I don't know what to say
It's okay, Leonard
Okay, all right, good
Oh, boy, group hug
So, what's up?
Well, Penny is on her way to perform in a one-night showcase production of Rent, 213 00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:46,457 which we are unable to attend,
because we're going to a symposium on molecular positronium
given by Dr Emilarmanfarmian
Wait a minute Farmanfarmian is speaking and you're bogarting the symposium?
- Howard, I'm sorr
- No, no, you're quark-blocking us
I don't know what to say
Howard, listen
It's okay It's your Millennium Falcon
You and Chewbacca do whatever you wanted
Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening
Howard, wait
Sheldon, I think we should tell them
Okay, sure
I don't see a problem with that
There's no symposium
Leonard lied to me
Isn't that right, Leonard?
Well
I don't know what to say!
It's okay; I do
Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis
He made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farman
Farmian
Good for you
Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed
And there's nothing to be embarrassed about
Every family in America has a relative
holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner
No, I'm lost, too
I think she skipped a step
No, look
Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach
The whole family's going out for an intervention
Leonard is driving Sheldon down there
to help him through this, because he's such a good man
Another hug? Thank you
All right, you guys, good luck
Thanks, Penny
Break a leg!
Break a leg!
So, road trip to Long Beach
- We're not going to Long Beach
- Why not?
Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug-addicted cousin Leopold
Oh, too bad
I've always wanted to go to Long Beach
It's a very nice community
The Queen Mary is docked there
Once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant,
where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner
- Sounds fun - I'm game
- No, no, no
Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then, it's iffy
Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?
Leonard?
Let it go, Sheldon
The murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not
No, that's the least of our worries
I've been doing some research on addiction,
both the biochemical and behavioral aspects--
and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie
What are you talking about?
It's fine! She bought it; it's over
Sadly, it's not
Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle,
but beyond that, I have realized that the Leo I described
would not have agreed to go to rehab
- Why not?
Because Leo's a middle child
There is no Leo!
How can you say that?
You didn't read the bio, did you?
He's not just a middle child, he is the quintessential middle child--
from a broken home, to boot
Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling,
even to the point of self-destruction,
is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab
- I've got a solution
- Great What is it?
Get out!
Fine
I've hesitated to point this out,
but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament
because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit
I'm just trying to clean up after your mess
We'll talk in the morning
Morning
Who are you?
I am Sheldon's cousin Leo
Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo
Au contraire 
I'm 26 years old
I'm originally from
Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat,
so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world
As a result, I've often felt like an outsider--
never really fitting in,
which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem
Excuse me, we just went over this
As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted
in your unmet need for attention
Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology?
For your information, this is based on solid research
Just stick with the character profile I wrote for you
Sheldon?
I'm sorry
Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld
He's a research assistant in the particle physics lab,
but he also minored in theater at MIT
It was more of a double major, actually
Theater and physics
You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me toward
Yeah, I got it
Sheldon
why?
You see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab,
it is completely plausible,
that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us
How about this as my motivation-- when I was 14 years old,
I was abused in the Philippines by a clubfooted Navy chaplain
No We're going with middle child
and a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production
Swell How do I play genetic predisposition?
Subtextually, of course
Just have fun with it
- Morning, Penny
- How did the intervention go?
Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab
Based on what you told me, I am not surprised
But we did convince him to leave the motel
Come say hello
Leo
This is Penny, our friend and neighbor
Hi, Leo
How are you feeling?
Let me ask you something, Penny
Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit,
next to a transsexual prostitute?
No
Then don't ask me how I'm feeling
Well, that's Leo
why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?
It was okay, I guess
It wasn't a big turnout, but they both really seemed to like it
There were only two people there?
By the end, yeah
Damn you, Chaplain Harrigan!
I'm I'm sorry?
The Philippines
1992
The Subic Bay Naval Station
A young boy on the cusp of manhood
His only companions,
mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes
Desperate and alone,
he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him
to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him
to a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat
What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away?
Don't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction
- That's never been proven
- There have been studies
Not double-blind studies
How could there be?
Who would be the control group?
As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly
Let's give them some privacy
Do you want to come over and have coffee?
Ah, sounds good
I have a video of me singing last night
Do you want to see it?
Gee, why wouldn't I?
This is even better than you coming to the showcase,
because now I get to watch you watch me
Yeeaaahh
Funny how things work out
but he loved the companionship and the wisdom
that his own father failed to provide
Your parents made the right decision
I cannot work like this
This is amazing
Just sitting on a couch watching TV with a woman
Not being drunk or high
or wondering if you're a dude down there
Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy
You're going to do okay
One day at a time, Penny
One day at a time
How long is he going to stay here?
He's a homeless drug addict Leonard
Where is he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Here's the problem with teleportation
Lay it on me
Assuming a device could be invented which would identify
the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location
and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly,
you would not have transported the individual
You would have destroyed him in one location
and recreated him in another
How about that
Personally, I would never use a transporter,
because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated
in order to create a new Sheldon
Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?
No, he would be exactly the same
That is a problem
So you see it too
Dr Hofstadter Dr Cooper
Dr Gablehauser
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim
Dennis is a highly sought-after doctoral candidate,
and we're hoping he'll do his graduate work here
- Graduate work Very impressive - And he's only 15 years old
Not bad I, myself, started graduate school at 14
Well, I lost a year while my family was tunneling out of North Korea
Advantage: Kim
I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around
Let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country
I already know you're not
You don't have an Open Science Grid computer or a free electron laser
The string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end
Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end
Obviously you don't see it yet, but trust me, you will
Dennis, we've discussed this
We're in the process of updating our equipment,
and we welcome your input on our research goals
We've agreed to look the other way
if you use up to 20% of the grant money you attract
to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang
We want him here, boys
- Make it happen - Yes, sir
You can count on us We're on it
What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?
I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory
could be as large as 10 to the 500th power In addition
Look, chocolate milk
I sense a disturbance in the Force
A bad feeling I have about this
Season 1 Episode 12: The Jerusalem Duality
Dennis, how long have you been in America?
- A year and a half - No kidding
- You speak English really well - So do you
Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions
What are you talking about?
That
He's not wrong
All right And this is my office
- Is this part of the tour? - Nope Goodbye
Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything
All right This is my desk
These are my books; this is my door Please close it behind you Goodbye
Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections
Keen observation Goodbye
You see where you went wrong, don't you?
Get him out
Come on I'll show you the rec center They've got Nautilus equipment
Do I look like I lift weights?
Not heavy ones
It's startling you haven't considered
a Lorentz invariant or field theory approach
You think I haven't considered it?
You really think I haven't considered it?
Have you considered it?
- Get him out, Leonard - Come on, Dennis
I'll show you the radiation lab
You won the Stevenson Award?
Yes In fact, I am the youngest person ever to win it
Really? How old?
Fourteen and a half
You were the youngest person ever to win it
It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it?
This is really delicious, isn't it?
Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh?
Sweetie, you are so damaged
Hey, I'm damaged, too
How about a hug for Howie?
Sure Raj, hug Howard
Something you'd like to share?
A tale of woe, perhaps?
15 years old
Dennis Kim is 15 years old, and he's already correcting my work
Today, I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, to
- You know, that other guy - Antonio Salieri?
Oh God, now even you are smarter than me
You know, you don't have so many friends
that you can afford to start insulting them
Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better
Why waste food?
In Texas, when a cow goes dry, they don't keep feeding it, they just
take her out and shoot her between the eyes
I'm confused Did Sheldon stop giving milk?
You can't let this kid get to you
You always knew that someday someone younger and smarter would come along
Yes, but I assumed I would've been dead hundreds of years
and that there'd be an asterisk by his name because he'd be a cyborg
So you've got a little competition I really don't see what the big deal is
Of course you don't You've never excelled at anything
I don't understand exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?
We liked Leonard
What are you gonna do, just give up?
It's what a rational person does when his entire life's work
is invalidated by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind
He ceases his fruitless efforts,
he donates his body to scientific research,
and he waits to die
I'm confused again Is he waiting,
or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?
I've decided you're right My career is not over
Great!
Since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless,
I just have to find something else to focus on
Great!
So I've decided I'm going to collaborate with you
Great
So what exactly is it you do?
You chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention
Right now, I'm designing an experiment
to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at see level,
- but I really don't need any help - Sure you do
See, what's this here in the schematic? Is that a laser array?
- Yes - Now
What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium-neon?
- It would blow up - Are you sure?
Pretty sure
"Pretty sure" is not very scientific
Is this how you normally work? Just hunches and guesses and stuff?
I understand that you're going through a bit of a career cris,
you're searching for some other area
where you can feel valuable and productive,
but I need to tell you something I want you to listen carefully
- All right - Go away
If you're concerned about sharing credit with me,
your name can go first I'm going
It's a small, brown paper bag, Ma!
I'm looking in it right now
Why would I make that up? There's no Ding Dong in it
How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow gonna help me today?
So
This is Engineering, huh?
I'll talk to you later
Engineering
Where the noble semiskilled laborers
execute the vision of those who think and dream
Hello, Oompa-Loompas of science
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
I just came by to say hello
I've been in this lab for 3 years You've never come by to say hello
Up until now, I've had better things to do
So, what are we making today?
A small payload support structure
for a European science experimental package
- that's going up on a space shuttle - Really? How does it work?
When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay,
and the sensor apparatus will rest on it
So, it's a shelf
No, you don't understand During acceleration,
it needs to stay perfectly level and provide
Yeah, it's a shelf
I notice you're using titanium
Did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes?
They're lighter, cheaper, and have twice the tensile strength
There's a diploma in my office
that says I have a master's in engineering
You also have a note from your mother that says, "I love you, Bubula"
But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes
Go away!
Did Leonard tell you to say that?
No, I thought of it all by myself
That can't be a coincidence
There must be some causal link I'm missing
Go away!
Curiouser and curiouser
- Is he here? - If he were, I wouldn't be
Do you know what he did? He watched me work for 10 min,
and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me
Is that even possible?
As it turns out, yes
Something's got to be done about him
Like what? He'll never be able to cope with the fact
that some 15-year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is
What if something happened to this boy
so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?
Then our problem would be solved
Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim?
I'm not saying no
We don't have to go that far There are other means available
We can't send him back to North Korea
He knows how to get out
The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus
Won't happen He is not interested in anything but physics
- What about biology? - What?
You know, biology
The one thing that can completely derail a world-class mind
He's 15
Yeah, so? When I was 15, I met Denise Palmeri
and my grade point average fell from a 50 to a 18
She was sleeping with you?
No, I just
wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did
Oh, good, you're all here
Look, if the three of you drop
whatever it is you're working on and join me,
we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade 12 years, tops
Go away?
Could it be me?
What's up?
We need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys
What?
Howard, that's racist Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick
It's possible she may have misunderstood us
Dr Cooper Are we interrupting?
No, please come in I think you'll appreciate this
This is very exciting
- What are you working on? - Something remarkable
Since my prospects for the Nobel prize in physics have disappeared
thank you very much,
I've decided to refocus my efforts
and use my people skills to win the Nobel peace prize
I will solve the Middle East crisis
by building an exact replica of Jerusalem
in the middle of the Mexican desert
To what end?
It's like the baseball movie
"Build it and they will come"
Who will come?
The Jewish people
- What if they don't come? - We'll make it nice, put out a spread
Okay, well, speaking of spreads,
we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim
who's agreed to join us here at the university
Of course he has
The Oracle told us little Neo was the one
You can see the matrix, can't you?
Well, obviously you're very busy with your
Come, Dennis
You'll have to excuse Dr Cooper He's been under a lot of
He's nuts
They'll come, they'll settle, and I'll win the prize
I really don't understand your objections, professor Goldfarb
Why wouldn't the Sonora desert make a perfectly good promised land?
Go away
We could call it Nuevo Jerusalem
Please go away
Said Pharaoh to Moses
Why are all these young women here?
It's Take Your Daughter To Work Day
Really? I was not aware of that
Yes There was a very official e-mail
sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated
they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16
- Smooth - Thank you
There's the man of the hour
Okay, so we now have a socially-awkward genius
in a room full of attractive, age-appropriate women
All he has to do now is hook up with one of them
Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
- We need a social catalyst - Like what?
We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk
- Or can we? - No, we can't
I don't think you mean "we can't" I think you mean "we shouldn't"
You're a Jew If there was another Wailing Wall
exactly like the one in Jerusalem
but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs,
would you still be able to wail at it?
Okay, it's definitely me
We cannot leave this to chance Let's pick a girl
and figure out how to get her together with Dennis
How about that one?
I know the type
Cheerleader, student council, goes out with the jocks,
won't even look at anybody in the gifted program
If after 2 years of begging, she agrees to go out with you,
it turns out to be a setup and you're in your mom's car with your pants off
while the whole football team laughs at y
- Are you crying? - No, I have allergies
Okay
How about her?
Sure, if he wants to spend two years
doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor
with nonfat White Russians
You're holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking
and telling you she wishes "more guys were like you"
Then she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay
for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend
and she acts like she doesn't even know you
Okay, so not her, either
How about her?
Interesting, kind of pretty,
a little chubby, so probably low self-esteem
I think that's our girl One of us should go talk to her
I can't talk to her you do it
I can't just go up and talk to her Howard, you talk to her
She'll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this
In India, this would be simpler
5 min with her dad, 20 goats and a laptop, and we'd be done
- We're not in India - Why don't we do it your way then?
We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis
so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end
- Okay, that was uncalled for - You started it, dude
Could I have everyone's attention, please?
What a wonderful occasion this is,
and how fortunate that it should happen to fall
on Take Your Daughter to Work Day
We're here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family
Welcome, Dennis Kim
Mr Kim
was not only the valedictorian at Stanford University,
he is also the youngest recipient
of the prestigious Stevenson Award
Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!
And now, without any further ado,
let me introduce the man of the hour,
Mr Dennis Kim
What?!
Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research?
No, thanks I'm going to the mall with Emma
The kid got a girl
Unbelievable
Did anyone see how he did it?
Don't worry, I've got this
Ladies and gentlemen,
honored daughters,
while Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivete,
has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact,
let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted,
and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me
Thank you
- He's back - Mission accomplished
Forget the mission How did that little yutz get a girl on his own?
I guess times have changed since we were young
Smart is the new sexy
Then why do we go home alone every night? We're still smart
Maybe we're too smart
So smart it's off-putting
Yeah, let's go with that
Unbelievable
Components I built are on the International Space Station
and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park
I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch
as it was for you telling the policewoman,
"You have to frisk me I have another rocket in my pants"
Look at that
It's Dennis Kim
I almost didn't recognize him
I kind of feel bad about what we did to him
Yeah, we really ruined his life
Screw him He was weak

More details about the new Star Trek film
There's going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth
I'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception
Oh, please
For Vulcans, mating or if you will, PonFahr
- it's an extremely private matter - Still, I'd like to know the details
His mother was human His father is Vulcan
- They couldn't just conceive - Maybe they had to go to a clinic
Can you imagine Spock's Dad in a little room
with a copy of Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears
How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same?
No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, "Hey, get your thing out of my nose"
Hi Can you help me?
I was writing an e-mail and the "A" key got stuck
Now it's just going "Aaa"
- What'd you spill on it? - Nothing
Diet Coke
And yogurt
And a little nail polish
I'll take a look at it
Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news
Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair aren't fielding a team
in the university Physics Bowl this year
You're kidding Why not?
They formed a barbershop quartet and got a gig
playing Knott's Berry Farm
So, in your world,
you're like the cool guys
Recognize
This is our year With those guys out,
the entire Physics Bowl will kneel before Zod
Zod?
Kryptonian villain Long story
Good story
- Count me out - What? Why?
You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition?
Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary?
Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle?
Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?
Come on, you need a four-person team We're four people
By that reasoning we should also play Bridge, hold up a chuppah
and enter the Olympic bobsled competition
Tickets to that, please
Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you?
No, don't
"The needs of the many
" outweigh the needs of the few
"Or the one"
Damn it, I'll do it
Season 1 Episode 13: The Bat Jar Conjecture
First order of Physics Bowl business
We need a truly kick-ass team name Suggestions?
How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?
It's beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads-up for the ladies
The ladies?
"Perpetual Motion Squad we can go all night"
- I like it - I don't
Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures,
thus intimidating one's opponent
- Then we could be the Bengal tigers - Poor choice
Gram for gram, no animal exceeds
the relative fighting strength of the army ant
Maybe so,
but you can't incinerate a Bengal tiger with a magnifying glass
Let's put it to a vote All those in favor
Point of order
I move that any vote on team names must be unanimous
No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with a Bengal tiger
when common sense dictates it should be an army ant
Will the gentleman from the great State of Denial yield for a question?
I will yield
After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes,
all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit
- if he does not get his way? - He does
I move we are the Army Ants All those in favor?
Good afternoon, and welcome to today's Physics Bowl practice round
I'm Penny, and I'll be your host
because apparently I didn't have anything else to do
on a Saturday afternoon, and isn't that just a little sad?
Gentlemen, ready?
- Yes - Fire away
It's none of my business, but isn't a guy
who can't speak in front of women gonna hold you back a little?
He'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd
He only has a problem when they're one-on-one and smell nice
Thanks, Raj It's vanilla oil
I was actually the one who noticed Okay, let's just start
Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics
"What is the shortest light pulse ever produced?"
- Dr Cooper - And of course,
the answer is 130 attoseconds
- That is correct - I knew that, too
Good for you, sweetie Okay, next question:
"What is the quantum mechanical effect
"used to encode data on hard-disk drives?"
And of course the answer is giant magnetoresistance
- Right - Hey, I buzzed in
And I answered It's called teamwork
Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions?
I am an engineer
By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions
because I'm a mammal
Just ask another one
"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses
of Einstein's predicted frame dragging?"
And of course, it's Gravity Probe B
Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer
Why?
Because it's polite
What do manners have to do with it?
This is war
Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage
to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions
The objective of the competion is to give correct answers
If I know them, why shouldn't I give them?
Some of us might have the correct answers, too
Oh, please You don't even have a PhD
- All right, that's it! - Howard, sit down
- Maybe we should take a little break - Good idea I need my wrist brace
All this button-pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury
I agree
What did he say?
He compared Sheldon
to a disposable feminine cleansing product
one might use on a summer's eve
Yeah, and the bag it came in
Leonard, excellent I want to show you something
Can it wait? I need to talk to you
Just look I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team
The colors are based on Star Trek: The Original Series 
The three of you will wear Support Red, and I will wear Command Gold
Why do they say "AA"?
Army Ants
Isn't that confusing? "AA" might mean something else to certain people
Why would a Physics Bowl team be called Anodized Aluminum?
No, I meant
Never mind
Check it out,
I got you a Batman cookie jar
Oh, neat! What's the occasion?
Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman 
and cookies, and you're off the team
What?
Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting
- No, you didn't - Yes, we did I just came from there
Okay, I don't know where you just came from,
but it could'nt have been a team meeting because I wasn't there
Ergo, the team did not meet
Okay, let me try it this way:
I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends,
and one thing led to another, and it turns out you're off the team
Why?
Because you're taking all the fun out of it
I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics Bowl the team that has the most fun?
Okay, let me try it this way:
You're annoying and no one wants to play with you anymore
I see
At this point I should inform you
that I intend to form my own team
and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together
and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears
Thanks for the heads-up
You're welcome
- One more thing - Yes?
It's on, bitch
- So who'd he get to be on his team? - He won't say
He just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar
He's using psychological warfare
We must reply in kind I say we wait until he looks at us,
then laugh like, "Yes, you are a smart and strong competitor,
"but we are also smart and strong,
and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you"
How exactly would that laugh go?
That sounds more like, "We are a tall, thin woman
who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians"
Let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my roommate
So?
So nothing Let's destroy him
Gentlemen
We're going to need a strong fourth for our team
You know who is apparently very smart is the girl who played TV's Blossom 
She got a PhD in neuroscience or something
Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our Physics Bowl team
How about the girl from The Wonder Years ?
Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution to all our problems
We can't ask Leslie Winkle
Why? Because you slept together, and when she was done with you
she discarded you like last night's chutney?
Yes
Sometimes you've got to take one for the team
Sack up, dude
Fine
Here I go, taking one for the team
in the sack
- Hey, Leslie - Hi, guys
So, Leslie, I have a question for you,
and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I
Hit that thing
Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable
just because we've seen each other's faces
and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus
There's not?
Gee, 'cause it sure sounds like there should be
Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship
regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance
are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom
That's all very comforting, but if it's okay,
I'd like to get on to my question now
Proceed
We are entering the Physics Bowl, and we need a fourth for our team
No, thanks I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton supersymmetry search
Dilepton, shmylepton We need you
Sorry
Well, we tried
We'll just have to face Sheldonmano y mano y mano a mano
Wait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper?
That arrogant, misogynistic, East Texas doorknob
that told me I should abandon my work with high-energy particles
for laundry and childbearing?
She's in
So, how do you feel?
Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on?
Are you ready?
Yeah You know, you don't have to stay for the whole thing
Oh, no I want to Sounds really interesting
Gentlemen
I'm just gonna sit down
So, is that your team?
Actually, I don't need a team
I could easily defeat you single-handedly,
but the rules require four
So, may I introduce the third-floor janitor,
the lady from the lunch room, and my Spanish is not good
either her son or her butcher
And what about your team?
What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?
Hello, Sheldon
Leslie Winkle
Yeah, Leslie Winkle The answer to the question,
"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?"
Well, I'm polymerized tree sap, and you're an inorganic adhesive
So whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction
is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory
and adheres to you
Oh, ouch!
Okay, if everyone could please take your seats
Here's your T-shirt
PMS?
It's a couple days early
It stands for "Perpetual Motion Squad"
Of course What was I thinking?
Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl!
Today's preliminary match features two great teams
AA versus
PMS
All night long, y'all!
Okay, well, let's jump right in First question for ten points:
"What is the iso-spin singlet partner
"of the pi-zero meson?"
PMS?
- The eta meson - Correct
- Formal protest - On what grounds?
The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt
Denied All right, for ten points,
"What is the lightest element on Earth
"with no stable isotope?"
AA?
And of course, the answer is technetium
Terrific
Next question:
"What is the force between two uncharged plates
"due to quantum vacuum fluctuations?"
PMS?
Sheldon can suck on the Casimir effect
Correct
How does a quantum computer factor large numbers?
PMS?
- Shor's algorithm - Correct!
41855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie
Prevost's theory of exchanges
Lambda equals one over pi r squared n
760 degrees Celsius
the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row
Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning
A sigma particle
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the Earth
Correct!
Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question
The score now stands AA: 1,150,
PMS: 1,175
So, for 100 points and the match,
please turn your attention to the formula on the screens
Solve the equation
Holy crap
What the hell is that?
Looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell
Come on Think Leslie?
It's not gonna work if you rush me You have to let me get there
You are never gonna let that go, are you?
Ten seconds
PMS?
Sorry, I panicked
Then guess
Eight
4
I'm sorry, that's incorrect
AA,
if you can answer correctly, the match is yours
He doesn't have it
He's got squat
AA, I need your answer
The answer is minus eight pi alpha
Hang on a second That's not our answer
- What are you doing? - Answering question
Winning Physics Bowl
How do you know anything about physics?
Here I am janitor
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist
Leningrad Politechnika
Go Polar Bears
That's a delightful little story,
but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything
- I answer the questions - You didn't answer question
Look, now, maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia,
but on this Physics Bowl team, I rule with an iron fist
AA, I need your official answer
- It's not what he said - Then what is it?
- I want a different question - You can't
- Formal protest - Denied
Informal protest
Denied
- I need your official answer - No I decline to provide one
That's too bad because the answer your teammate gave was correct
That's your opinion
- The winner of the match is - Hang on
Is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important
that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team?
I don't understand the question
- Go ahead - The winner is PMS
Sorry, somebody's sitting there
Who?
My Physics Bowl trophy
That trophy is meaningless I forfeited, therefore you did not win
- I know someone who would disagree - Who?
My Physics Bowl trophy
Leonard is so smart
- Sheldon who? - All right, that is very immature
You're right I'm sorry I'm not!
- Okay, new contest - What are you doing?
I am settling once and for all
who is the smartest around here, okay?
- Ready? - Absolutely
Bring it on
"Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters
"in what TV family?"
The Brady Bunch 
"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?"
The Brady Bunch? 
Van Halen 
"Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum"
Oh, my God! Sean Penn!
How do you know these things?
I go outside, and I talk to people
Okay, here "What actor holds the record
"for being named People Magazine 's Sexiest Man Alive?"
- William Shatner - Wait
I don't think it's Shatner
Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart
Formal protest
"Singer who sang, Oops, I Did It Again ?"
"Tweetie Bird tought he taw a what?"
Romulan
Yes
He tought he taw a Romulan

This sandwich is an unmitigated disaster
I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat
- What did they give you? - Turkey and roast beef
with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat
It's the right ingredients, but in the wrong order
In a proper sandwich,
the cheese is adjacent to the bread
to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce
They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash
- I don't believe it - I know It's basic culinary science
Some guy is auctioning off a miniature Time Machine prop
from the original film, and no one is bidding on it
A time machine from the movie The Time Machine ?
No A time machine from Sophie's Choice 
Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie
Did you see it? It's rough
- That's cool - It's only $800?
Yeah And that's my bid
You bid $800?
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing I figured it would go for thousands,
and I just wanted to be a part of it
There's only 30 sec left in the auction
Do you have $800?
Not to blow on a miniature time machine
Don't worry People wait until the last second to bid,
and they swoop in and get it It's called sniping
15 seconds
Come on, snipers
10, 9,
- 8 - Where are your snipers?
- 5 - Snipe
- 4 - Snipe
- 3 - Snipe!
- 2 - Snipe!
1
Congratulations!
You are the proud owner of a miniature time machine!
You lucky duck
I wonder why no one else bid
This is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia
- Yeah, I know! I still can't afford it - Why don't we share it?
We'll each put in 200 bucks, we'll take turns having it in our house
A time-share time machine
I'm in Sheldon?
Need you ask?
I still don't understand why no one else bid
I understand why no one else bid
Episode 114: The Nerdvana Annihilation
Transcript: swsubcom Sync: sub-wayfr | italiansubsnet
Did the listing actually say "miniature"?
I just assumed
Who sells a full-size time machine for $800?
In a Venn diagram, that would be an individual located
within the intersection of the sets "No longer want my time machine"
and "Need $800"
It's actually a tremendous bargain
Even with shipping, it works out to less than four dollars a pound
Cocktail shrimp are $1250
How are we going to get it upstairs?
If we take the dish off, it might fit in the elevator
Yes, but the elevator has been broken for 2 years
I've been meaning to ask you
Do you think we should make a call about that?
Not necessary I have a Master's in engineering
I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis
I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads
When the Mars Rover started pulling to the left,
I performed a front-end alignment
from 62 million miles away
No That baby's broken
Come on, guys! Push!
If I push any harder, I'm going to give birth to my colon
I can't feel my fingers Hurry up!
It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go
- Basic physics - Sheldon?
If my fingers ever work again, I've got a job for the middle one
- Hey, guys - Hi, Penny
Take a break, guys
- What are you doing? - We're just moving something upstairs
- What is it? - Just
You know Time machine
Neat But I really got to get to work
- Give us a few minutes - I don't have them I'm running late
Then, I have a simple solution
Go up to the roof Hop over to the next building
There's a small gap, don't look down if you're subject to vertigo,
and use their stairwell
You're joking, right?
I never joke when it comes to vertigo
Damn Okay, I'll just take the roof
If you wait for us to set up the time machine,
I can drop you off at work yesterday
Time travel joke It's not never mind
For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous
Let's just do this
- You guys ready to push? - In a minute
Howard stepped outside to throw up
I don't know what you were worried about
I think it really works in the room
It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned
The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor
from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future,
where society had splintered into two factions:
the subterranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting
on the flesh of the gentle surface-dwelling Eloi
Talk about your chick magnets
The guy who lives next to me is always like,
"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony"
But wait until I tell him,
"I've got a time machine on my balcony
Stuff that in your Speedoes, Jacuzzi Bob"
Gentlemen, we said we'd take turns, but I think you'll agree
that practicality dictates it remain here
You can't keep it here What if I meet a girl and say,
"You wanna come up and see my time machine?
It's at my friends' house" How lame is that?
He's got a point
I think we're going to need some ground rules; in addition to the expected
"no shoes in the time machine," and "no eating in the time machine,"
I propose we add "pants must be worn at all times in the time machine"
Seconded
I was going to put down a towel
I still want it on my balcony
I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis
- That sounds fair - Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term
It's every other month or twice a month?
- Twice a month - Then no
- Okay, every other month - No
You can't be selfish
We all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us
Now get out of the way so I can sit in my time machine
I am setting the dials for March 10, 1876
Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone
- and calls out for Dr Watson - Wait a minute
- I'd want to see that, too - So when it's your turn, you can
But if we all go back to the same point,
Bell's lab is going to get very crowded He'll know something's up
Also since the time machine doesn't move in space,
you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena
And even if you can make it to Boston, are you going knock on the door
and say to Mrs Bell, "Big fan of your husband
"Can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?"
Mrs Bell was deaf She's not even going to hear you knock
I have a solution First, go into the future
- and obtain a cloaking device - How far into the future?
If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device
from the Romulans on Stardate 50273,
which would be January 10, 2328 by pre-Federation reckoning
I am setting the dials for January 10, 2328
Here we go into the future
That was fun
My turn!
Okay, first of all,
what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide
- I slipped and skinned my knee - Are you okay?
Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked,
so I had to go down the fire escape, which ends on the 3d floor,
forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family
who insisted I stay for lunch
- That doesn't sound too bad - It was eight courses of lamb,
and they tried to fix me up with their son
- Sorry - Not done
By the time I finally got to work, they'd given my shift away
That's right I lost an entire day's pay thanks to this
- This - Time machine
The lights flash and the dish spins You want to try it?
I don't want to try it!
My God, you are grown men!
How can you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes
and comic books and now that?! That
Again Time machine
Please, it's not a time machine If anything, it looks like something
Elton John would drive through the Everglades
It only moves in time
It would be worse than useless in a swamp
Pathetic! All of you!
Completely pathetic!
My turn!
Leonard, it's 2:00 in the morning
So?
So it's my turn
Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
Because I want to go back and keep myself
from getting a time machine
You can't
If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past,
you wouldn't have it available in the present to travel back
and stop yourself from buying it Ergo, you would still have it
This is a classic rookie time-travel mistake
Can I go back and prevent you from explaing that to me?
Same paradox
If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious,
you would not then have the conversation that irritated you,
motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious
What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
It won't change the past
But it'd make the present so much nicer
Are you upset about something?
What was your first clue?
Well, it was a number of things
First, the late hour
Then your demeanor seems very low-energy,
- plus your irritability - Yes, I'm upset!
I don't usually pick up on those things
Good for me
Good for you
Wait
Did you want to talk about what's bothering you?
- I don't know Maybe - I'm on fire tonight
Here's the thing
Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines
I disagree
Your inability to successfully woo Penny
long predates your acquisition of the time machine
That failure clearly stands on its own
- Thanks for pointing it out - In addition, your premise is flawed
In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux
with that very time machine
In Back to the Future , Marty McFly got the opportunity
to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother
- Those are movies - Of course they're movies
Were you expecting me to come up with an example
involving a real-life time machine?
That's absurd
Come on, guys, push!
If I push any harder, I'm going to give birth to my colon
- Hey, guys - Hi, Penny
Take a break, guys!
- What are you doing? - You know, just moving a time machine
Neat, but I really gotta get to work
No problem
Hang on
But what about your time machine?
Some things are more important than toys
I'm scared
Don't worry, baby I've got you
It's still my turn
What are you doing?
I'm packing up all my collectibles
and taking them down to the comic book store to sell
Was that really necessary?
If you need money, you can always sell blood
And semen
This is not about money
We brought food!
Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time-travelers
Terrific Does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?
- Why? - I don't want it anymore
- Why? - Just personal reasons
My Spidey sense tells me this has something to do with Penny
Look, do you want to buy me out or not?
I'll give you $100, which will make me half-owner
and we'll put it on my balcony
Screw his balcony I'll give you $120 and we'll put it in my garage
I paid $200 for my share
Dude, everybody knows a time machine loses half its value
the minute you drive it off the lot
I'll go for $200 That time machine stays right where it is
$300 and I'll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon
with real light speed sound effects
No No more toys or action figures
or props or replicas or costumes or robots
or Darth Vader voice changers
I'm getting rid of all of it
You can't do that Look what you've created here
It's like nerdvana
More importantly, you have a Darth Vader voice changer?
Not for long
I call dibs on The Golden Age Flash 
I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection
- Too bad I called dibs - You can't just call dibs
I can and I did Look up "Dibs" in Wikipedia
Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war
It's not a bidding war
I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store
- Did Larry call dibs? - Will you forget dibs?!
He offered me a fair price for the whole collection
- What's the number? I'll match it - I'll match it plus a thousand rupees
- What's the exchange rate? - None of your business
Take it or leave it?
Mom? My bar mitzvah bonds How much do I got?
Thanks
I can go $2,600 and two trees in Israel
Forget it, guys
If I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me
Who cares? As long as you pick me!
Okay, Leonard, put down the box Let's talk
Sorry, Raj My mind is made up
No!
I can't let you do this
Get out of my way
None shall pass!
I did not want to do this,
but I have here the rare mint condition production error
Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi La Forge
without his visor in the original packaging
If you do not get out of my way,
I will open it
Okay, man Be cool
We're all friends here
What the hell's going on?
You hypocrite!
What?
Little Miss "grown-ups don't play with toys"
If I were to go into that apartment now, would I not find Beanie Babies?
Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies?
And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts?
Hello, Hello Kitty!
Okay, look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard,
I am really sorry about what I said I was just upset
- I need to hear it - No, you didn't You are a great guy
and it is the things you love that make you who you are
I guess that makes me "large breasts"
Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff
and, you know, move on with my life
- Really? - Yeah
Well, good for you
Thanks
Do you want to I don't know, later
Excuse me
- Hey, Penny - Hi, Mike
- Ready to go? - I just have to change
- I'll give you a hand - Stop it!
Bye, guys
My turn on the time machine!
It worked
It really worked
They said I was mad, but it worked!
Not Morlocks!
Not flesh-eating Morlocks!
Help!
Sheldon, are you okay?
We have to get rid of the time machine
It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?
Yeah, that's the problem It's too big
I'm glad you agree I hired some guys to help us move it
Come on in, fellas
Morlocks!
Eat him Eat him
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
- Take him down! - He's got you, Sheldon
- Look at this move! - He's completely schooling you
Hey, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something
It's called Tresling
It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling
with the mental agility of Tetris into the ultimate sport
That's terrific, but they wanted me to ask you
to cut it the hell out
Great Come here, guys Come on
Happy birthday to you 
We might as well stop It's a stalemate You're beating me in Tetris,
but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler elf
Keebler elf? I've got your Keebler elf right here
Okay, it's a stalemate
So, Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday
- for your free birthday cheesecake? - He can't eat cheesecake
- He's lactose intolerant - He can have carrot cake
- What about the cream cheese frosting? - He can scrape it off
Forget about the cake How do you know my birthday's Saturday?
I did your horoscope, remember? I was gonna do everybody's,
until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants
For the record, "that psychotic rant" was a concise summation
of the research of Bertram Forer, who, in 1948, proved conclusively
through meticulously designed experiments
that astrology is nothing but pseudo-scientific hokum
Blah, blah, blah Typical Taurus
Are we gonna see you Saturday?
- I don't think so - Why not?
- I don't celebrate my birthday - Shut up Yeah, you do
It's no big deal; it's just the way I was raised
My parents focused on celebrating achievements,
and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them
That's so silly
It's actually based on very sound theories
- His mother published a paper on it - What was it called?
"I Hate My Son and That's Why He Can't Have Cake"?
It was obviously effective
Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist
Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas,
he'd be a little better at it
- Thank you - You're welcome
Well, I love birthdays
Waking up to Mom's special French toast breakfast,
wearing the birthday king crown,
playing laser tag with all my friends
Yeah, see? That's what kids should have
Actually, that was last year
So you really never had a birthday party?
No, but it was okay When I was little, I'd think
maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party
Like this one birthday I came home from my cello lesson
and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front
When I got to the door, I could hear people whispering
and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favorite
And?
It turns out my grandfather had died
Oh, my God That's terrible
Well, it was kind of like a birthday party
I got to see all my cousins, and there was cake, so
It's the saddest thing I've ever heard
You think?
Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom
Episode 116: The Peanut Reaction
Transcript: swsubcom Synch: sub-wayFr | italiansubsnet
Make sure they remember, no peanuts
Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts
When they see me coming, they go, "Ah, no-peanut boy!"
- Hello, Penny Leonard just left - I know I want to talk to you
What would we talk about?
We have no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of
As you know, I don't care for chitchat
- Can you just let me in? - All right,
but I don't see this as a promising endeavor
Here's the deal We're gonna throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party
- for his birthday on Saturday - I hardly think so
Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party
Did someone say "party"?
He just doesn't know he wants one 'cause he's never had one
I suppose that's possible, but for the record,
I've never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one
Howard, here's the difference The possibility exists
that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over
Fine If I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it
I'm just kidding Yes, you can
Can you bring a friend?
I think a birthday party's a terrible idea
I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish
Anguish?!
Year after year, I had to endure
wearing comical hats while being forced
into the crowded, sweaty hell of bouncy castles
Not to mention being blindfolded
and spun toward a grotesque tailless donkey
as the other children mocked my disorientation
Okay, sweetie, I understand
you have scars that no nonprofessional can heal,
but, nevertheless, we're going to throw Leonard a birthday party
Have I pointed out that I'm extremely uncomfortable with dancing,
loud music and most other forms of alcohol-induced frivolity?
- Nevertheless - In addition, I
Here's the deal:
You either help me throw a birthday party or I will go into your bedroom
and unbag all of your most valuable mint-condition comic books
And on one of them, you won't know which,
I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink
You can't do that If you make a mark in a mint comic, it's no longer mint
Do you understand the concept of blackmail?
Well, of course, I
I have an idea Let's throw Leonard a kick-ass birthday party
That's not the secret knock
This is the secret knock
What difference does it make?
The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal
to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators
- Is that Raj and Howard? - Possibly, but unverified
Will you just let us in
Luckily for you, this is not a nuclear reactor
- So what'd you get the birthday boy? - Well, Raj got him an awesome,
limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman
And I got him this amazing autographed copy
of The Feynman Lectures on Physics 
Nice
I got him a sweater
Okay, well, he might like that I've seen him get chilly
- Sheldon, I didn't see your present - That's because I didn't bring one
- Why not? - Don't ask
The entire institution of gift-giving makes no sense
- Too late - Let's say I go out
and I spend $50 on you
It's a laborious activity because I have to imagine what you need,
whereas you know what you need
Now, I could simplify things just give you the $50 directly,
and then you could give me $50
on my birthday, and so on, until one of us dies,
leaving the other one old and $50 richer
And I ask you, is it worth it?
Told you not to ask
Sheldon, you're his friend Friends give each other presents
I accept your premise; I reject your conclusion
Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention
- What? - Just do it
It's a non-optional social convention
Oh Fair enough
He came with a manual
Question How am I going to get Leonard a present before the party?
I don't drive and the only things available within walking distance
are a Thai restaurant and a gas station
I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob
and a couple of lottery scratchers
Okay let's do this
I will drive Sheldon to get a present Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard
- for about 2 hours - No problem
And then, Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up
What if guests show up?
Entertain them
What if they're women?
Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable
- How's it goin'? - Fine
So listen, the NuArt is showing the revised,
definitive cut of Blade Runner 
Seen it
No, you've seen the 25th Anniversary Final Cut
This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage
They say it completely changes the tone of the film
Pass
Come on Afterwards, there's a Q & A with Harrison Ford's body double
Look, I'm in the Halo battle of my life here
There's this kid in Copenhagen he has no immune system,
so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24-seven
- Can't you play him some other time? - Not if you believe his doctors
Oh, my God, do you smell gas?
- No - Yeah, no
They have DVDs over there
Yes, but they have DVD burners over here
Leonard needs a DVD burner
A gift shouldn't be something someone needs, it should be something fun
Something they wouldn't buy for themself
You mean like a sweater?
It's a fun sweater
It's got a bold geometric print
Is it the geometry that makes it fun?
The point is one of the ways we show we care about people
is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them
Okay, I see So, not a DVD burner
Exactly
Something he wouldn't buy for himself, something fun,
Something like An 802-11n wireless router!
Here you go, Copenhagen boy
How about a taste of Hans Christian hand grenade?
That could not feel good
Come on, come Oh, you clever
Come on
Take that!
- What's the matter? - This granola bar has peanuts in it!
- Oh, my God Why did you eat it? - I don't know It was just there!
If I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?
Don't yell at me! I've got to go to the emergency room!
- Now?! - No, after my tongue has swollen
to the size of a brisket!
All right, just let me get my keys
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
The laundry is out of the hamper
Okay, Sheldon, what was it supposed to be?
Fine It's out of the washer!
I'll call you when it's in the dryer
All right, let's go
- What do you think? - That one
Because of the two additional Ethernet ports?
- Sure - No need,
he's already got a six-port Ethernet switch
- Okay, then this one - Why?
I don't know The man on the box looks so happy
Penny, if I'm going to buy Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it right
I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did
I know I'm gonna regret this, but: What trauma?
On my 12th birthday,
I really wanted a titanium centrifuge
so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes
Of course
Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me
This is hard
They got me
a motorized dirt bike
What 12-year-old boy wants a motorized dirt bike?
All of them?
- Really? - Yeah
So we're getting this one?
- Yeah, I suppose - All right, let's go
Excuse me Do you know anything about this stuff?
I know everything about this stuff
Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business
and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance
with the one in my refrigerated warehouse
Buy this one: it's the one we're getting Happy guy
No, she doesn't want that
She needs a point-to-point peer network with a range extender
Thank you
Which hard drive do I want
firewire or USB?
It depends on what buss you have available
I drive a Chevy Cavalier
Oh, dear Lord
- We have to go - Not now
This poor man needs me You, hold on I'll be right with you
What computer do you have? And please don't say "a white one"
- Excuse me - Fill this out Have a seat
Listen We're throwing my friend a surprise party
I'm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for 2 hours
Fill this out and have a seat
No, the only way I could get him to leave
was to tell him I ate a peanut because I'm allergic to peanuts
Well, in that case, fill this out and have a seat
All I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a Band-Aid
so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine, and you tell my friend
you need to keep me under observation for 1 hour 1/2
- Is that all you need? - Yes
Get out of my ER
- No, you don't understand - I understand, but unfortunately,
this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid
Okay, I get it I know how the world works
How about if I were to introduce to you
to the man who freed your people?
Unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin
and his five twin brothers, you are wasting your time
Sorry, I couldn't find a parking spot
- How are you doing? - Bad, very bad
Really? You don't look like you're swelling up at all
We should just pick up some Benadryl at the drugstore and go home
- We can't go home - Why not?
Because
because
Brisket! Brisket!
- Water! Need water! - I'll be right back
I've got a problem
Well, so do I You gotta stall Leonard a little longer
- I don't think I can - You have to
We all have to be there at the same time to yell surprise
You have to understand something We're in a hospital right now
- Why? Is Leonard okay? - Leonard's fine I'm fine
Thanks for asking, by the way
Okay, I don't need your attitude Just hold him there a little longer
I've done my best, but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him
Okay, how about this? You keep him there a little longer,
and when you get to the party, I'll point out which of my friends are easy?
Don't toy with me, woman
I got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem,
a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around
a alcoholic who's 2 tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat
Thy will be done
I'm doing this for you, little buddy
Okay, we don't have that in stock
but I can special-order it for you
Him
Excuse me, sir You don't work here
Yes, well, apparently, neither does anyone else
- Sheldon, we have to go - Why?
For one thing, we're late for Leonard's birthday party,
and for another, I told him to call security
Good luck
By the way, a six-year-old could hack your computer system
Keep walking
"1234" is not a secure password
Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts
- No, he's not - Yes, he is
Look, sir, we are very busy here, and I
Holy crap!
Please help me!
Code four! I need a gurney!
- Right away! Right away! - Thank you
Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country,
but when they're afraid of lawsuits, they sure test everything
I really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary
You know, before you got all swollen up,
I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment
so you could throw me a surprise party
Right, it's your birthday I had no idea it was your birthday
I completely forgot What a lousy way to spend a birthday
It's all over now
There is a party, isn't there?
Maybe
- Are you mad? - How could I be mad?
You actually risked your life because you care about me
Yeah, that's why I did it
All right
Here we go
My first birthday party
Dude,
everybody left an hour ago
Surprise!
Okay, Leonard I am at your birthday party
I don't know where you are, dude, but it's really kick-ass!
Everyone is very, very drunk and
And look, there's a girl taking her shirt off!
That's my friend Carol
Remind me, I gotta introduce her to Howard
Oh, sweet Krishna, shake that rupee maker!
I'm so sorry you didn't get your party
It's okay
Happy birthday, anyways
When's your birthday?
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Wo de zing shi Sheldon
Non, c'est
Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon
Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon
What's this?
That's what you did
I assumed, as in a number of languages, that the gesture was part of the phrase
Well, it's not
How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher, it's your obligation
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter
You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin
- Why? - Once you're fluent,
you'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me
Mei du lui zi 
You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey
My apologies,
I'm only as good as my teacher
Why are you learning Chinese?
I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off
orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them
If I were you, I'd be more concerned
about what they are passing off as chicken
- I need to use your window - Sure, go ahead
Hey, jerk face, you forgot your iPod!
- What's going on? - I'll tell you what's going on
That stupid self-centered bastar wrote about our sex life in his blog
Drop dead, you stupid self-centered bastard!
Thank you
Okay, where were we?
Not now, I have a blog to find
Episode 117: The Tangerine Factor
Transcript: swsubcom Synchro: sub-wayfr | italiansubsnet
Penny, are you okay?
I'm fine, Leonard Just go away!
I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful
- Go away! - Okay, feel better! Bye!
She doesn't want to talk
Not surprising Penny's emotional response is originated
in the primitive portion of the brain, known as the amygdala
While speech is centered in the much more recently developed neo-cortex
The former can easily overpower the latter,
giving scientific credence to the notion of being "rendered speechless"
Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk
Look, I found an iPod!
It's smashed beyond repair What are you gonna do with it?
What else? Sell it on eBay as "slightly used"
It was Penny's boyfriend's, they broke up
Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship
on his blog which I cannot find anywhere
I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again
Good idea, sit with her
Hold her, comfort her
And if the moment feels right,
see if you can cop a feel
I'm not going to do that, Howard
I'm not aware of a new social convention that requires you to intervene at all
What about damsel in distress?
Twelfth century code of chivalry? Not exactly current
You'd also have to be knighted for that to apply
I don't care She's upset, I'm going over there
Remember to sit on your hands a bit, so they're warm
I'm her friend I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability
So you're saying, if in the depths of despair,
she throws herself at you and demands you take her,
right there, right now, you'll just walk away?
I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend
Listen, I know you said you didn't want to talk
- I don't - Sorry
- Wait! - Wait? Did you say "wait"?
Tell me the truth
Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?
So I pick good guys but turn them into losers
- Of course not - Well,
it's gotta be one or the other Which is it?
I'm sorry, what were the choices again?
I really thought Mike was different
I thought he was
sensitive and smart,
I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart
Yeah, no, sure
And then he just goes and has to humiliate me
by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it
I tell you, it's not all that easy to find
Really? My friends at work found it, my sister found it
Judging by my email, a number of prisoners
at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it
What exactly did this guy write?
Not that I need to know the details of your sex life I just thought
Never mind
No, you know what?
You might as well read it Everybody else has Go ahead
Oh, God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed!
I just want to crawl into a hole and die!
Okay Well, you know, this isn't that bad
It just paints the picture
of a very affectionate woman,
who's open to expressing her affection
in non-traditional locales
Oh, God!
Elevators, parks,
movie theaters
Out of curiosity,
is this "subway" the transportation system
or Subway the sandwich shop?
Sandwich shop
Doesn't that violate the health code?
No, at the sub shop we were only making out
But my point is that
you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed
Really? Do you think I overreacted?
- Maybe a little - Because I do that I do overreact
Maybe I should call Mike and apologize
That would be under-reacting
He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom
And in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise
You're right I should just say "I am done with him"
Yes, you should Go ahead, say it
But I never gave the man a chance to explain
What is there to explain? It's all right here
The betrayal!
No, you were right the first time
This is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way,
which is trying to show people how he feels
I'm pretty sure I never said that
You did better than that You helped me see it on my own
Oh, good for me
Where are you going?
I'm going over to Mike's Leonard, thank you so much
Oh, sure
Maybe I am her gay friend
I'm going to need another Mandarin lesson
I obviously didn't make my point with those people
For God's sake,
if you don't like the tangerine chicken, don't order the tangerine chicken
I like tangerine chicken, I'm just not getting tangerine chicken
- Can we please change the subject? - Sure
Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her boyfriend
Just roll the dice
"Enslaved by warlocks Stay here until you roll two, four or six"
She was mad at him!
She was done with him! The relationship was broken beyond repair,
and I walked over there, and I fixed it
Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it
Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling
Previously, I felt sympathy for the Leonard character,
now I just find him to be whiny and annoying
Eat your tangerine chicken
I'd love to, but I don't have tangerine chicken
Thank you so much for your stupid advice!
Incredible
You managed to screw up the screw-up
I'm back
I'm sorry I yelled at you
It's not your fault
What happened?
I went over to Mike's to make up with him
Yeah No, I know that part
But he had already moved on
Already? That was quick
That's what I said to the woman who had her legs around his neck
- Penny, I am so sorry - How could he do that?!
You know, you did throw an 80-gig iPod
Yeah, no, how could he do that?
I swear to God I am done with guys like that
You know, macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money
Yeah, that must get old quick
You know, just once
I would like to go out with someone
who is nice and honest
and who actually cares about me
What about me?
What about you what?
What about if you went out with me?
Are you asking me out?
Yes, I am
asking you out
I was just going off your comment about the nice guy
- No, I got that - And honest
- Totally - It's not a big deal
Yes what?
Yes, I will go out with you
Really?
Why not? I mean What do I have to lose?
That's the spirit
Show me your citrus peels
Gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee 
Show me your citrus peels
Gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee 
Sheldon?
I'm sorry
Look, do you have a second?
A second what, pair of underwear?
I was just wondering if I could talk to you It's about Leonard
Why me?
Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
Well, Raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk,
and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting
Yes, I suppose he is
All I'm saying is, you know Leonard the best
Not necessarily
I'm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard
Just the other day I discovered he not only has a loofah,
he hides it
Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah?
I, myself, prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally,
but I don't condemn those who seek to accelerate the process
And until recently,
I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance,
he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream
without producing a noxious gas that I maintain,
in the right concentration, could be weaponized
Leonard might come home Can we talk in my apartment?
We're not done?
No
Why not? We're already through the looking glass anyway
Okay, so here's the thing
I guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out
He didn't actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment
he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia 
That's nice
Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about
is, since Leonard and I have become friends I was just
Wanna sit down?
I wish it were that simple
I don't spend much time here, and so I've never really chosena place to sit
Well, choose
There are a number of options and
I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities,
air flow patterns and dispersion of unlight
to make an informed choice
Why don't you just pick one at random and if you don't like it
- you can sit somewhere else next time - No That's crazy
You go ahead and talk while I figure it out
Here's the thing
So I've known for a while now that Leonard has had
- a little crush on me - A little crush?
I suppose so in the same way Menelaus had a "little crush" on Helen of Troy
I don't really know who they are
- Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon - I don't care
The point is,
Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with
Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with
Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?
No What I'm saying is
Leonard might be different in a good way
Obviously, my usual choices have not worked out so well
Your last one worked out well for Koothrappali
He got a free iPod
Glare
On the other hand, if things don't go well with Leonard,
I risk losing a really good friend
I'm guessing he's not looking for a fling
He's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for
- like you would say, light years - I would not say that
No one would say that A light year is a unit of distance not time
Thank you for the clarification
Draft
People hear the word "year" and they think duration
"Foot-pound" has the same problem, that's a unit of work, not of weight
Right Thanks
- It's a common mistake - Not the first one I've made today
I think this will be my seat
Do you have anything to say that has anything to do with
what I'm talking about?
Well, let's see
We might consider Schrodinger's cat
Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?
That's Mrs Grossinger
She doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless
- Annoying little animal - Sheldon
Sorry, you diverted me
Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger,
in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics,
he proposed an experiment
where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison
that will break open at a random time
Now, since no one knows
when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened,
the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead
Sorry I don't get the point
Of course you don't get it I haven't made it yet
You'd have to be psychic to get it, and there's no such thing as "psychic"
Sheldon, what's the point?!
Just like Schrodinger's cat,
your potential relationship with Leonard right now
can be thought of as both good and bad
It is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is
Okay, so you're saying I should go out with Leonard
Let me start again In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger
Two seats right there
- Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake - I can see that
Unless you're planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing
and mashed potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy
No, it's about Penny
A mistake involving Penny
You'll have to narrow it down
I don't think I can go out with her tonight
Then don't
Other people would say "Why not?"
Other people might be interested
- I'm going to talk anyway - I assumed you would
Now that I'm actually about to go out with Penny,
I'm not excited, I'm nauseous
Then your meal choice is appropriate
Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit
available for violent expulsion
Right
You also made a common grammatical mistake
You said "nauseous," when you meant "nauseated"
But go on
Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny
What happens if I blow it?
Well, if we accept your premise
and also accept the highly improbable assumption
that Penny is the only woman in the world for you,
then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it
would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny
The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers
from Scooby-Doo cartoons comes to mind
You're not helping
What response on my part
would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?
Tell me whether or not to go through with the date
Schrodinger's cat
That's brilliant
You sound surprised
- Come on in - Thank you
You look very nice
Thank you So do you
I made an 8:00 reservation
Okay, yeah, great Listen
Maybe we should talk first
But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger's cat?
Actually, I've heard far too much about Schrodinger's cat
Good
All right, the cat's alive Let's go to dinner
Crazy man Call the police!
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
So you see, what you're eating is not technically yogurt,
because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures
It's really just ice milk with carrageenan added for thickness
That's very interesting
It's also not pink and has no berries
Yeah, but it doesn't really answer my question
- What was your question again? - Do you want some?
- Right No I'm lactose intolerant - Right
- So, gas - Yeah, got it
Well good night
What are you doing?
There's a draft
I didn't feel a draft
Why don't we just go into, your
Yeah, you know what, maybe we should slow things down a little
I didn't mean to go into your apartment to
- go fast - No, I know
I know what you meant, it's just this is only our first date
Okay, sure, no problem
Why don't we just figure out where we're going
and when we want to get there,
and then rate of speed equals distance over time
Solve for R
Or we could just wing it
That might work, too
- Good night, Leonard - Good night
He's coming Screensaver!
Hey, Leonard How was your date?
Bite me
Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?
They were clever
They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing
You should thank us When future generations try to determine
why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned,
this right here is the black box
What are you talking about? The date went fine
She said she wants to slow things down
Okay, so she said she wants to slow things down
It's like saying, "I'm really enjoying this meal
"I'm going to slow down and savor it"
No, it's like, "This fish tastes bad,
"so I'm gonna slow down and spit it out"
- You being the fish - I'm not the fish
Really? Did you make a second date?
No, we sort of decided to wing it
Even I know that's lame
Okay, all right, let's assume your hypothesis
We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed
Where could I have possibly gone wrong?
Think back, Leonard The littlest things can set women off
Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot,
"I bet we could get her to come home with us"
Or, "How much does your mom weigh?
"I want to know what I'm getting into"
- I didn't say anything like that - Good, 'cause they don't work
They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate
Sadly, that's my home run swing
Look, everything went fine
I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters
That woman across the hall is into me
Let's go to the tape
Look at her reaction to the good night kiss
No change in respiration, pupils un-dilated,
- no flushing of the chest - Nice close-up, by the way
Interesting Her jaws are clenched: no tongue access
Clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans
That's not a bad sign
Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement
And the worst sign of all is you're here and not there
I'm not there because I'm taking things slow,
which, by the way, compared to you guys, approaches warp speed
And take down that camera
He was a lot more fun when he had no hope
Give him time
Episode 201: The Bad Fish Paradigm
Synch: Sixe, Jesslataree
seriessubcom / sub-wayfr / foromcom
Hi
Oh, hi, Penny
FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine two, so colors only,
and four is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle,
- so avoid using it for your delicates - Thanks
Good Lord why don't you just take your clothes
down to the river and beat them with a rock?
Can I ask you a question?
I would prefer that you not, but I won't go so far as to forbid it
All right, I heard yes, so
Here's my question
Has Leonard ever dated,
you know, a regular girl?
I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity
Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate
No, I meant, has he ever been involved with someone
who wasn't a brainiac?
A few years ago, he did go out with a woman
who had a PhD in French literature
How is that not a brainiac?
Well, for one thing, she was French
For another, it was literature
So
Do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating,
he'll eventually get bored with me?
- That depends - On what?
Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?
Do you speak Klingon?
- You know any card tricks? - Okay, you know what
I get it Leonard has no business being involved
with a waitress-slash-actress who felt so insecure
that she lied to him about finishing community college
Why would you lie about that?
He was going on and on about this college and that grad school,
I didn't want him to think I was some kind of stupid loser
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser"
was "community college graduate"?
You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country
who are community college graduates
Yeah, but you are neither
Right
Okay, this is between you and me You cannot tell Leonard any of this
You're asking me to keep a secret?
Well, I'm sorry,
but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret,
so I could've chosen if I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping
You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis
What?
Secret keeping is a complicated endeavor
One has to be concerned not only about what one says,
but about facial expressions, autonomic reflexes
When I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics
than a Lyme disease research facility
It's a joke
It relies on the homonymic relationship
between "tick," the bloodsucking arachnid,
and "tic," the involuntary muscular contraction
I made it up myself
Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied,
I will absolutely die of embarrassment
- Physiologically impossible - Sheldon, please
Look, I am asking you as a friend
So you're saying that friendship contains within it
an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
Yeah
Interesting
One more question, and perhaps I should have led with this
When did we become friends?
 ie, I couldn't become Green Lantern
unless I was chosen by the Guardians of Oa,
but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility,
I could be Batman
You could be Batman?
Sure I'm Batman See?
- Hi, guys - Hi, Penny
If you're free Friday night, I thought maybe we could go see a movie
Oh, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday
What about Saturday?
I'm not sure; the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet
- How about I let you know? - Great
So you just let me know when you know
Okay, so Oh, God, I am the bad fish
What did I do wrong?
Why are you asking me?
I have no information about your interactions with Penny
other than what you have provided me,
nor do I have any method of learning such things
- What does that mean? - Nothing
You seem to be implying an informational back-channel
between me and Penny where obviously none exists
No, I didn't
I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir
- What's going on with you? - I might ask you the same question
Why are you attempting to drag me
into matters which have nothing to do with me,
but exist between you and Penny, a person to whom I barely speak?
What's wrong with your face?
There's no reason to bring my looks into this
Good day, Leonard
- What? - I said, "Good day"
"Good day"?
Also today, we have a fresh-caught Alaska salmon,
and that's served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice
- Our soup of the day is - You must release me from my oath
Sheldon, I'm working
- Why don't you take a minute to decide? - Oh, my
I can't keep your secret
I'm going to fold like an energy-based de novo protein
in conformational space
Like a Renaissance tryptich
Like a cheap suit
Look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?
I'm constitutionally incapable That's why I was refused clearance
for a prestigious government research fellowship
at a secret military supercollider
located beneath a fake agricultural station
125 miles southeast of Traverse City, Michigan
Which you did not hear about from me
Just forget I told you about me
- not graduating from community college - Forget?
You want me to forget? This mind does not forget
I haven't forgotten a single thing
since my mother stopped breastfeeding me
- It was a drizzly Tuesday - Okay
You promised me you would keep my secret,
so just figure out a way to do it
Leonard, I'm moving out
What do you mean, you're moving out? Why?
There doesn't have to be a reason
Yeah, there kinda does
Not necessarily
This is a classic example of Munchausen's Trilemma
Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons
leading to an infinite regression,
or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements,
or it's ultimately circular,
ie I'm moving out because I'm moving out
I'm still confused
Leonard, I don't see how I could have made it any simpler
Hey, qu'est-ce que s'up ?
We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticized human cadavers
And some of those skinless chicks were hot!
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack
That's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia
It's not you, Howard He says he's moving out
What did you do?
Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the TV?
Did you take a Band-Aid off in front of him?
Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink,
talk to him through the bathroom door?
Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro,
pronounce the "t" in often?
Did you make fun of trains?
No, I didn't do anything He's just gone insane
We all knew this day was coming
That was fast
It's my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag
It's recommended by the Department of Homeland Security
And Sarah Connor
Where are you going to live?
Until I find a permanent place, I will stay with friends
Bye
You can't stay with me I have a teeny-tiny apartment
Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests an aspect of manushya yajna ,
one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?
I hate trains
Don't be ridiculous, you love trains
Yes, I do Come on
See you later, Leonard
This could work
This is a very old building
60 years It used to be a watch factory
What?
Don't you worry about the residual radium
from the luminous dials?
Not until now!
I can't believe I didn't bring my Geiger counter
I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it
- If you're not comfortable staying - I'm kidding, I packed it
It was a joke
I was subverting the conversational expectations
I believe they call that the ol' switcheroo
Terrific
Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?
Yes, isn't she an amazing actress?
Actually, I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit
How dare you!
Aishwarya Rai is a goddess
By comparison, Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you
Obviously, you're not that familiar with Indian cinema
Who is it?
Strip-o-Gram!
Tag, you're it
Shouldn't you put him in a brown paper bag
and set him on fire?!
I've never slept on an air mattress before
No lumbar support whatsoever
Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench
I don't see any way to get a park bench in here
- Do you want to switch? - No, that's fine
I'm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle
- Get out of bed We're switching - Only if you want to
Just get in the bed!
What's going on? 
Are you boys roughhousing? 
We're just talking, Ma!
If you don't settle down right now, 
I'm not going to let you have any more sleepovers! 
For God's sake, Ma, I'm 27 years old!
And it's not even a school night!
Comfy now?
That poster of Halle Berry is a little unnerving
So don't look at it
She's like my fourth favorite Catwoman
No kidding
Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, and then her
What about Lee Merriweather?
I forgot about Lee Merriweather
I'm glad that's settled
That makes Halle Berry my fifth favorite Catwoman
It's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,
- Eartha Kitt, Lee Merriweather - Please, I'm begging you Go to sleep
I'm trying I'm counting Catwomen
She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies, though
- For God's sake - She's not my favorite of the X-Men
In order that would be: Wolverine, Cyclops
I forgot Professor X
Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops,
Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast--
No, wait, Nightcrawler
Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, Storm,
Angel
I'm coming!
There he is
There my old buddy bud bud
What's with him?
Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn't get to sleep,
so I gave him a glass of warm milk
with a handful of my mom's Valium in it
but he still wouldn't shut up, so tag, you're it
I'm ba-ack
- I still don't know why you left - I can't tell you
Why not?
I promised Penny
You promised Penny what?
I wouldn't tell you the secret
What secret? Tell me the secret
Mom smokes in the car
Jesus is okay with it but we can't tell Dad
Not that secret The other secret
- I'm Batman! - Damn it! Sheldon!
You said Penny told you a secret What's the secret?
Okay, I'll tell you,
but you can't tell Leonard
I promise
Penny lied about graduating from community college
'cause she's afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard
So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?
I drank milk that tasted funny
Penny thinks I'm too smart for her That's ridiculous
I know
Most of your work is extremely derivative
And don't worry, that's not a secret
Everybody knows
Hi Yeah, hi
I know what's been bothering you about us, and I have the answer
What are you talking about?
First, I wanna say that it's not Sheldon's fault
He tried very hard to keep your secret
If Howard hadn't drugged him, he would've taken it to his grave
- He told you? - Yes, but it's okay
Now that we know what the problem is there's a simple solution
Pasadena City College?
"A place for fun, a place for knowledge"
This man here is playing hackey-sack, and this girl's gonna be a paralegal
Oh, I get it
Because Dr Leonard Hofstadter
can't date a girl without a fancy college degree
It's really not that fancy It's just a city college
Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?
That doesn't matter to me at all
So it's fine with you if I'm not smart
Absolutely
Okay, this time, I know where I went wrong
Bite me!
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Fellow warriors,
This is sheldor the conqueror
We are about to enter axidus' fortress
Now, this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check
All right, barry, we'll wait for you again,
But you really should see a doctor
Sheldor is afk
Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?
Yes I can't get my stupid door open
You appear to have put your car key
In the door lock-- are you aware of that?
Yeah
All right, then
Damn it,
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it!
Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?
I can't get the damn key out
Well, it's not surprising-- that baldwin lock on your door
Uses traditional edge-mounted cylinders,
Whereas the key for your volkswagen
Uses a center cylinder system
Thank you, sheldon
You're welcome
Why did you put
Your car key in the door lock?
Why? I'll tell you why-- because today I had an audition,
It took me two hours to get there,
I waited an hour for my turn,
And before I could even start,
They told me I looked too midwest
For the part
Too midwest-- what the hell does that even mean?
Well, the american midwest was mostly settled
By scandinavian and germanic people
They have a characteristic facial bone structure
I know what it means, sheldon!
God! you know, I have been in la for almost two years now,
And I haven't gotten a single acting job
I've accomplished nothing, haven't gotten
A raise at work, haven't  even had sex in six months,
And just now, when I was  walking up those stairs,
A fly flew in my mouth and I ate it!
Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures
They're almost pure protein
Oh, son of a bitch!
I believe the condensation on your frozen foods
Weakened the structural integrity of the bag
But returning to your key conundrum,
Perhaps you should call a locksmith
And have him open the door for you I did
He said he'll get here  when he gets here
And you're frustrated because he phrased his reply
In the form of a meaningless tautology? no!
I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything
And my breath smells like fly
There, there
Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
No, sheldon, I'd rather sit on this freezing-cold floor
Sobbing like a three-year-old
All right, then
For heaven's sake
Just when I think I've gotten the hang of sarcasm
Make yourself comfortable
Not there
Sheldor is back online
Sheldor?
The conqueror
What are you doing?
Afk
I'm playing
Age of conan,  an online multiplayer game
Set in the universe of robert e howard's
Conan the barbarian
Sheldor back online
What's "afk"?
Afk
Away from keyboard
Oh, I see
What does that stand for?
Oh, I see
Yes, but what does it stand for?
Now, just click on the enchanted boots to put them on
Mm, I don't know-- can I see them in another color?
Just click on them
Yeah, congratulations
You are now a level-three warrior
What's going on? leonard, guess what?
I'm a level-three warrior
Great
Do you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?
Yeah, yeah, yeah shh
I only bring it up because your ice cream's melting
And it's starting to attract wildlife
Uh-huh, yeah
Do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?
It doesn't matter-- right now; you're looking for treasure
Wait, wait, where are you going?
No, no you're okay
If you run into crocodiles, just kick them with your boots
You want to catch me up?
Well, let's see, uh,
She attempted to open her apartment with her car key
Because her face is overly midwestern, um
She hasn't had sex in six months
And she ate a fly
Seriously? six months?
Oh, my god!
A treasure chest! I'm rich!
Level three, and she thinks she's rich
What a newb
Okay
We're all set
Let her rip
Hi
Check it out-- it's just  corn starch and water
They make up
A non-newtonian fluid, which is liquid,
But solid under the percussive action of the speaker
That's what makes it get all funky
Yeah okay
Uh, listen, I need to talk to sheldon
No, that's what she said-- sheldon
Okay, I'm in the game,
And I've been exploring the island of tortage,
But I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain
Do you have the enchanted sword?
No, no, I have a bronze dagger
You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger
My lord, it's like the car key
In your apartment door all over again
All right, how do I get the sword?
Well, have you been to the temple of mishra?
Is that the place on the hill with
-The weird priest in front of it? -no, no, no, it's
Oh, for god's sakes, gimme
Thank you-- I really appreciate this
You're gonna have to learn
To do these things for yourself, penny
Don't patronize me-- just get the sword!
What the frack?
Beats me
They were playing all last night, too
It's like some kind of weird comic book crossover
Like if hulk were dating peppermint patty
I always thought peppermint patty was a lesbian
No, that's marcie
Peppermint patty's just athletic
There you go-- one enchanted sword
All right, gimme, gimme, gimme
I want to kill the guard captain
That girl needs to get a life
Sheldon?
Sheldon
Danger! danger!
No danger-- it's just me, penny
Listen, I got to level 25
And reached purple lotus swamp, right?
You're in my bedroom
Leonard gave me an emergency key
People can't be in my bedroom
Well, can we go talk in the living room?
I'm not wearing pajama bottoms
Why not?
I spilled grape juice
Well, wear different pajamas
I can't wear different pajamas-- these are my monday pajamas
Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom
Okay, fine, just tell me, is it too soon
To join a quest to the black castle?
-You were invited on a quest to the black castle? -yeah, yeah
By some guys in budapest
I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character
Of course it's not--  you're only
A level 25
These hungarians,
They're just using you for dragon fodder
Really? boy, you'd think you could trust
A horde of hungarian barbarians
Please, penny, enough
I have to sleep
Okay, well, you were great
Thanks
Oh hey, leonard listen, don't go in sheldon's room--
He's not wearing bottoms
Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?
People, I am very busy today
I realize that, dr gablehauser,
But it is your job, as head of the department,
To mediate all interdepartmental disputes
University policy manual,
Chapter Four, Subsection Two:
"mediation of interdepartmental disputes"
Fine
Dr winkle, what colorful name
Did you call dr cooper this time?
Dr dumb-ass
Dr cooper, dr winkle apologizes
No, I don't no, she doesn't
Here's the problem
I was clearly signed up
To use the mainframe in buckman 204,
And dr winkle just wantonly
Ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall
It wasn't even an official sign-up sheet
He printed it himself, and he put his name down
On every slot for the next six months
If it is a crime
To ensure that the university's resources
Are not being squandered chasing subatomic wild geese,
Then I plead guilty
Oh, penny! do you need
To get that, dr cooper?
-God, no -Well, don't turn it off,
You might miss your call from the nobel committee
Letting you know you've been nominated
As dumb-ass laureate of the year
Oh, yeah? well
You wouldn't even be nominated
Dr gablehauser, I have a series
Of important calculations and simulations to run
All she's doing is reducing irrelevant data
And making a mock
Excuse me
Gablehauser
It's for you
Hello?
Penny, this is not a good time
No, I told you,
You're not prepared for the sanctum of burning souls
You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest
And one should be a level 35 healer
Penny, I can't log on and help you
We'll talk when I get home
I'm not getting the computing time, am i?
Dumb-ass
Leonard, you have to do something about penny
She is interfering with my sleep,
She's interfering with my work,
And if I had another significant aspect of my life,
I'm sure she'd be interfering with that, too
Why should I do something?
You're the one who introduced her to online gaming yes,
But you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in
If you'd simply restrained yourself,
None of this would be happening
Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone?
I did, I told her,
I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter
I even changed my facebook status to
"sheldon cooper wishes penny would leave him alone"
I don't know what else to do
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I don't know, but if you don't figure something out,
I warn you, I shall become very difficult to live with
You mean up until now we've been experiencing
The happy, fun-time Sheldon?
Yes I'll go talk to her
No, fritz, I need you on my flank
No, I don't know german
Flankenzei, flankenzei
Hey, PennyBusy
Yeah, I see that
Shouldn't you be at work?
I don't work on mondays
It's thursday
Listen, Penny
Queen penelope, afk
What?
Here's the thing
Sometimes people, good people,
Yeah, they start playing these games
And they find themselves--
Through no fault of their own--
You know, kind ofaddicted
Yeah, get to the pointI'm about to level up here
It's just if a person doesn't have
A sense of achievement in their real life,
It's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world
Where they can get a false sense of accomplishment
Yeah, jabber, jabber, jabberokay, boys,
Queen penelope's back online
Penny, you've got
Cheetos in your hair
Oh thanks
Hey, Penny, it's me again, Leonard
Leonard, I said not now
I know, I'm just a little concerned about you
I said not now!
Okay, maybe later
Hey, guys
Hey, what's with him?
Penny's been keeping him up at night
Me, too
But probably in a different way
She's gotten really hooked on age of conan
She's playing nonstop
Ah, yes, online gaming addiction
There's nothing worse than having
That multi-player monkey on your back
Sheldon, wake up!
Danger! danger!
Afternoon, men
Sheldon
Oh, yeah?
Well, your attempt at juvenilizing me
By excluding me from the set of adult males, just
Oh, I'm too tired to do this
RightI heard you've been pulling all-nighters
With middle earth barbie
She comes into my room
No one's supposed to be in my room
I would postulate that she's escaping into the online world
To compensate for her sexual frustration
I do that, too
But probably in a different way
That's not what she's doing, Leslie
She's just trying to shore up her self-esteem
It has nothing to do with sex
Everything has to do with sex
Mm, testify
I'm not touching that
Leslie, you are way off base here
Hang on, leonard
While I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist
Or a human being,for that matter,
We have to
Concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields
Of promiscuity and general sluttiness
Thank you
My point is that tinker bell just needs to get her some
Some what?
Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse
I'll take the bullet
Excuse me, this whole idea is insane
Enough debate, I'm going to take action
Excuse me
Are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?
No
Would you like to be?
Uh sure, why not?
Sheldon
Puh-puh-puh
Can I have your phone number?
Uh yeah
There problem solved
Dumb-ass
Okay, I'm at the gate to the treasury of the ancients
I'm going in
Stay close to the wall
Avoid the mummies got it
I must say you're playing very well for a woman of 23
Twenty-two
Right, 22
Oh, here come the mummies
Which spell do I use, the hateful strike
Or the frenzy stance?
What happened to the rest of your group?
I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies
Frenzy stance
Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy
So, listen, would you describe your ideal vacation
As a wild adventure to unknown lands
Or staying at home curled up with a good book?
What?
These are market research questions
I'm filling out the online registration for your game
Oh, okay, wild adventure
Oh, frenzy stance isn't working
Die, you undead mummy, die!
Drink a healing potion
Thank you you're welcome
Anyhow, on a scale of one to five,
With one being always initiated by him
And five being always initiated by you,
How do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?
That's on the registration?
Oh, yes, it's quite extensive
But if we complete it,
You get a free expansion pack
75 additional quests
Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate
I'm a big ol' five
Good to know
Big ol' five
Hello
Hi
Leonard, this is tom
Hi, tom  sheldon
Didn't I explain to you
About your little mistake in the cafeteria?
Yes,
You were very clear
As was everyone else at the table
Tom, however, has been chosen by science
As a suitable mate for penny
Chosen by science?
Well, what passes for science on dating sites
They claim to use heuristic algorithms,
But it may well be hokum
You got penny to sign up for online dating?
No, of course not
See, I used trickery and deceit
This is bad
Tom is a paramedic with the fire department,
But he's going to med school at night
He likes the outdoors
And, uh, strong women who initiate sex
Really, really bad
I'm surprised you struck out with penny
Apparently, she's a big ol' five
Sheldon, what do you want?
Oh, good,
You got my note
Penny, I'd like you to meet tom
Penny, this is tom
Tom, may I present penny
Hi, penny
Yeah, hey listen
As long as I'm here,
I'm on a quest with a bunch of newbs
They don't know what they're doing
We've got one assassin,
Three spell casters and no tank
Can we talk about this later?
No, no, no, no I need you now
Wouldn't you prefer to socialize with tom,
Who is a sexually passive outdoorsman?
Whatever I'll figure it out myself
Bye, penny
I'm sorry, dude, she didn't look anything like her picture
They never do
hello, fair penny
Who are you?
It is i, sir howard of wolowitz
Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing
Followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?
Yeah, sure, why not?
Oh, my god, I need help
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Good morning
We're gonna have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work
I bought these Star Wars sheets, but,
they turned out to be much too stimulating
to be compatible with a good night's sleep
I don't like the way Darth Vader stares at me
I'm not going to work
Just because your career's been stagnant for a few years,
that's no reason to give up
I was up all night using the new free-electron laser
for my X-ray diffraction experiment
Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
No
Then you can drive Let's go
Ddn't I tell you I'd be working nights and that
you'd have to make other arrangements?
- You did - And?
I didn't
Let's go
Good night
- But how am I going to get to work? - Take the bus
I can't take the bus anymore They don't have seat belts,
and they won't let you latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords
You tried to latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
I didn't try I succeeded
But for some reason, it alarmed the other passengers
and I was asked to de-bus
You're a big boy You'll figure it out
Don't talk to me like I'm a child
Now, take me to return my Star Wars sheets!
What is it?
Leonard's asleep
Thanks for the update
No Wait
You have to drive me to work
Yeah, I really don't think I do
But I don't drive, and I can't take the bus
You'll be fine as long as you don't do that bungee cord thing, okay?
Didn't you recently state that you and I are friends?
Yes, Sheldon We are friends
Then I hereby invoke what I'm given to understand
is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship
The favor
Oh, dear God
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was interrupting your morning prayers
When you're done, we'll go
Subtitles: sub-wayfr
Thank you for driving me to work
You know this is my day off?
Oh, good I'm not keeping you from anything
Your "check engine" light is on
Typically that's an indicator to, you know, check your engine
It's fine It's been on for, like, a month
Actually, that would be all the more reason to
you know, check your engine
Sheldon, it's fine
If it were fine, the light wouldn't be on
That's why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it's not fine
Maybe the light's broken
Is there a "check the 'check engine light' light"?
What?
Studies have shown that performing tasks
such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving
reduces one's reaction time
by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol
Do you have any alcohol?
- Of course not - Too bad
You're going up Euclid Avenue?
Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue
Good for Leonard
Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies,
but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase
point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice
But you have the conn
If you're not going to slow down for the speed bumps,
I withdraw my previous objection
Here's a fun question
Do you know what the most common street name is?
- No - The answer's tricky
It's Second Street
You'd think it would be First Street, but in most towns,
First Street eventually gets renamed to something else
You know, like Main Street,
Broad Street
Michigan Avenue
Leonard and I often use our commute time
to exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that
We also play games
- Would you like to play one? - No
Come on It's fun
Another bump
Okay I'll say an element, and you say an element
whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay?
I'll start
Helium
Now, you could say "mercury"
That would give me a "y" Very clever That's a tough one
So I go with "ytterbium," which gets you back to "m"
So you go "molybdenum," and I say "magnesium"
You say "manganese" I say "europium,"
and, then, you're left with "mendelevium,"
and there are no more m's
because I believe that meitnerium should still be called ekairidium
So, congratulations You win
Do you wanna go again?
Why don't we just have a little quiet time now?
All right
I'm sorry I'm finding your reckless nonchalance
regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling
Get out
I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding
of the workings of an internal combustion engine,
I'm not sure I'm capable of performing diagnostics
I said, "Get out"
Okay I'll give it a shot
There you are I'm ready to go home
- I just got here - Good Perfect timing
I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night
I can't drive you for the next few weeks
No, you said you couldn't drive me to work
This is from work
Howard, help me out here
No, just for the fun of it, I'm gonna take his side
Now, how do you propose I get home?
How did you get here in the first place?
Penny
But I sense that's no longer an option
I need to get to the laser lab
You're just gonna have to find someone else to take you home
Damn, I picked the wrong side
God, not Euclid Avenue!
Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
- We had a difference of opinion - Over what?
Whether or not he was trying to kill me
For the record, I maintain he was
Where are you going? I'm taking you home
But I'm not going home It's Wednesday
Wednesday's new comic book day We have to go to the comic book store
Then, we have to stop at Souplantation;
it's creamy tomato soup day
And Radio Shack There's a sale on triple-A batteries
Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets
I have a better idea
You want to go to Pottery Barn first?
Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?
Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets
Good morning
Good morning
Sheldon, sit down
She's in my spot
Don't look at me like that Everybody knows that's my spot
You know that we care about you
And it's because we care about you that we've decided we have to speak up
You're hurting the people around you, sweetie
So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it
Department of Motor Vehicles New Driver Handbook?
But I don't have a problem
Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive
This madness has to stop
Penny's taking you to the DMV I'm going to bed
- Why Penny? - Because rock breaks scissors
Good night
- All right, come on, Sheldon - Hold on
- I have one condition - What?
We have to stop at Pottery Barn
And Radio Shack
Fine
- And the comic book store - All right!
I want to go to the comic book store
I like comic books
I still don't see why I need a driver's license
Albert Einstein never had a driver's license
Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn't make me wet myself
at 40 miles an hour
Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts
I gotta ask, why didn't you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?
I was otherwise engaged
Doing what?
Examing perturbative amplitudes in N=4 supersymmetric theories
leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties
of multi-loop N=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory
Well, how about when you were 17?
Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top,
sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back Next
Application?
I'm actually more of a theorist
The application in your hand
Give it to her
Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top,
sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back Next!
Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions
Look at that sign up there
Does it say "I give a damn"?
That's because I don't
Just look This first question makes no sense
"How many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving?"
There's no possible way to answer that
A "car length" is not a standardized unit of measure
Look at the sign
- It's "C" Just put down "C" - I don't need your help, Penny
Listen to that little girl, honey Put "C" Next!
Wait! Hang on
- Look at this next question - Why are you arguing with the DMV?
How else are they going to learn?
Look question two:
"When are roadways most slippery?"
Now, there are 3 answers, none of which are correct
The correct answer is "when covered by a film of liquid
"sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction
"between the tire and the road to essentially zero,
"but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction"
Here's your learner's permit Go away
But I'm not done
I have many additional concerns about these questions
- Don't make me climb over this counter - Come on
Next!
Aced it
That's it Let's boot it up
Booting
This is a state-of-the-art simulator
I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army
Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah
behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?
I haven't configured it yet
Let's see
Bradley tank
transport truck Batmobile
Here we go Red 2006 Ford Taurus
on the streets of Pasadena
What?
Statistically, red cars are stopped by police
far more often than any other color
I don't want any hassles with the fuzz
Fine, what color do you want?
You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber?
Before it was digitally remastered?
Black, it is
Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition
and shift into drive
I haven't fastened my seat belt yet
Okay, fasten your seat belt
- Now, are there air bags? - You don't need air bags
What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
I'll hit you in the face with a pillow
Okay, now shift into drive
Pull out slowly into traffic
Watch out, watch, watch out for the pedestrians!
Wait-- slow-- Hit the brakes! The brakes!
Thank you
Sorry Excuse me
My bad
Student driver
How did you manage to get on the 2d floor
of the Glendale Galleria?
I don't know
I was on the Pasadena freeway I missed my exit,
flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another
Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow
I quit
The pet store
Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software
It's amazingly detailed
So wait, you're just gonna give up?
No, I'm not giving up
I never give up
So, what is it you're doing?
I'm
transcending the situation
I'm clearly
too evolved for driving
What does that mean?
Have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors
are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?
I wonder a lot of things about you But not-not that
Well, those are indicators
that I'm farther along the evolutionary scale
- than the average human - No kidding
Hold on
I'm not gonna go so far as to say
that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind--
you know, a homo novus, if you will
That's for anthropologists to decide
But I am convinced
that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving
is because I'm not meant to
Yes, you are You're meant to learn how to drive
Please learn how to drive!
I'm meant for greater things,
like unraveling the mysteries of the universe,
not determing when it's safe
to pass a stopped school bus on a country road
- It's never safe - Yeah, well, I know that now
Fine
Assuming that everything you say is true,
how does the biologically superior homo novus get to work tomorrow morning?
Homo novus doesn't know
Well, hang in there
Maybe you'll evolve into something with wings
Good morning, gentlemen
Good morning
Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don't know about?
No, he lives here now
Really? Why?
Since he won't take the bus and he's too evolved to drive,
he decided it would be easier to sleep in his office
and shower in the radiation lab
until I'm finished with my experiment
But you finished your experiment a week ago
You saw nothing!
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics,
my door is always open
Once again, I'm sorry the demonstration didn't quite work out,
but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill
Peach Snapple into a helium neon laser
Short answer is don't
And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department
is Dr Sheldon Cooper
Forget it
Excuse me
- Sheldon, we both agreed to do this - It's a waste of time
I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics
to a bunch of labradoodles
If you don't do this,
I won't take you to the comic book store
Nice work with the laser, by the way
Looking out at your fresh young faces,
I remember when I too was deciding my academic future
as a lowly graduate student
Of course, I was 14
And I'd already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to,
despite my 9:00 bedtime
Now, there may be one or two of you in this room
who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics
It's more likely that you'll spend
your scientific careers teaching 5th graders
how to make papier mache volcanoes with baking soda lava
- Good God - In short
any one who told you that you would someday be able
to make any significant contribution to physics,
played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed
Any questions?
Of course not
I weep for the future of science
Now if you'll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out
Come, Leonard
Laser demonstration's looking pretty good now, huh?
Subtitles: sub-wayfr
I love this time of the year
The leaves are turning, there's a bracing chill in the air
Plus there's a whole new crop of female grad students
about to put on just enough winter weight
to make them needy and vulnerable
That's right, honey, have another calzone
Daddy can wait
Isn't there a university policy against dating graduate students?
No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out
Damn, there's always a catch
- Hey, guys - Hey, Leslie
So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night
The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat
of those unprepared to hear it
But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
Because first-rate minds call you "dumbass"?
Oh, yeah? Well
you're a mean person
Excuse me, Dr Cooper,
I'm Ramona Nowitzki I was at your talk last night
I think you're just brilliant
That is the prevailing opinion
Now I'm gonna throw up
Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering,
co-designer of the International Space Station's
Liquid Waste Disposal System
I've read everything you've published
I liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates
and was wondering how you determined that 3-dimensional string-nets
provided a unified picture of ferrnions and gauge bosons?
Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle
The fact is I'm quite close to a breakthrough
in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate
My God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe
It's what I do
You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System
is turning a few heads as well
Again, ew
I'd love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos
Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
I don't drink coffee
I do I love me a cup of joe
It doesn't have to be coffee How about dinner?
- I do eat dinner - Great
- I know a terrific Italian place - I never eat in strange restaurants
One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery
Excuse me?
Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork
Three tines is not a fork
Three tines is a trident
Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas
What if I brought food to your place?
That would be acceptable
On Mondays, I eat Thai food
Mee krob and chicken sate
with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace
You got it
I already have your address
What a nice girl
Do you have any idea what just happened?
Yes Apparently I'm getting a free dinner
Oh, yeah, no, this thing's majorly out of order
- See? Sorry - That's okay
Guess I'm taking the stairs
- Where you going? - 4- A
- You here to see Leonard? - No, Dr Cooper
Dr Sheldon Cooper?
We're having dinner
Sheldon Cooper?
Tall, thin,
looks a little like a giant praying mantis?
He is cute, isn't he?
- Hi, Leonard - Hey, Ramona Come on in
- Thanks Where should I put this? - The kitchen's fine
- Hey, what are you doing? - I need to see this
The viewing area's right over there
Sheldon, your girl date person Ramona's here
- Hello - Sorry I'm late
I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper
Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry
by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
So funny
But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity,
I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating
My hypotheses tend to have that effect
I'm sorry I didn't bring enough for your friends
I assumed we were going to be alone
No, we were just going
To watch, right?
No, come on, now, we're going out
Come on, we'll be quiet
Let's go
Okay, you two
Have a nice
whatever this is
Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business,
but I just I have to ask
What's Sheldon's deal?
- What do you mean "deal"? - You know, like what's his deal?
Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?
Honestly, we've been operating under the assumption
that he has no deal
Come on, everybody has a deal
Not Sheldon
Over the years, we've formulated many theories
about how he might reproduce
I'm an advocate of mitosis
I'm sorry?
I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food
and split into two Sheldons
On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species,
and someday he'll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later
with moth wings and an exoskeleton
Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares
Hey, do you want to hang out with us?
What are you guys gonna do?
My mom's making a brisket tonight
The one with the little onions?
Yeah, I'm busy, so
Good night
Her loss Let's go
Brisket party!
B- to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K
To-the-E-to-the-T
Don't
Aren't you having breakfast?
Yes
Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
Not in these pants
So how'd it go with Ramona last night?
Great She's smart, insightful
and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me
Here's your spinach mushroom omelet
Thank you
- Did anyone touch it? - Gloves were worn by everyone involved
I was vigilant
Ramona pointed out that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day
- standing on cafeteria lines - Time which would be better spent
tackling the great physics problems of our day
You don't tackle the big issues You fence with them
En garde Riposte
Touche
- Morning - Hey, Lesly
So I see you're organizing your papers
for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery
There won't be any room until they get rid
of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit
Good one
I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you
I'll let you keep your lunch money today
Dr Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough
If you're going to stay, you'll have to be respectful and quiet
Wait for me
Have you worked out the neutrino issue?
Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there
I just have to put them in the right order
You're so witty
Aren't I?
Hey, guys, this package came for
Dr Cooper is working
Yes, I'm close to a breakthrough
It tickles!
Sorry
Holy crap on a cracker
You probably don't want to go in there
Why? What are they doing?
The only way I could explain it would be in a therapist's office with dolls
Boy
Dr Cooper's working
Yeah, I can see that
Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali's You coming?
Yes, it's Halo night
Let me just dry my tootsies
- You're not going to Halo night - Yes, I am
It's Wednesday Wednesday's Halo night
Didn't a great man once say, "Science demands nothing less
"than the fervent and unconditional dedication
"of our entire lives"?
- He did - And who was that great man?
Me
- Sorry, Leonard - Seriously? You're not coming?
You heard her How can I argue with me?
Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good
whatever this is
Dr Cooper, I have to tell you your friends are holding you back
I prefer to think of it as "I'm pulling them forward"
Halo night?
A man with your intellectual gifts
doesn't waste an evening playing video games
He does on Wednesdays
Not if he wants a Nobel Prize
He does want that
Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
- What do you think? - Drat
- Now shall we get back to work? - I suppose
Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight
I guess I can wait for the DVD
And then, never ever watch it
Sheldon, honey, I've told you, it's a small apartment
You only have to knock one time
I don't have a lot of time
Ramona finally dozed off,
and I need you to help me get rid of her
Get rid of her how?
I don't know,
but apparently I'm in some kind of relationship,
and you seem to be an expert at ending them
Excuse me?
I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return
Okay, first of all, it is not man after man
Hide me
- Hide you? - I formally request sanctuary
Why aren't you working?
She distracted me
I told you, Penny, I don't have time for your nonsense
I have important things to do
Oh, man
- I know what's going on here - Really?
Then will you explain it to me?
You're in love with Dr Cooper
Yeah, no, that's not it
Don't try to deny it
He's a remarkable man,
but you have to let him go
Gee, okay
I know it's hard, but he's a gift to the whole world,
and we can't be selfish
Yeah, he's a gift all right
Sisters?
Sure
Sisters
Holy crap on a cracker
What are you doing?!
It's Morse code
Why?
So we can communicate through the wall
We are communicating through the wall
Yes, but the communication is not encrypted
I don't know Morse code
It's very simple This is A
This is B
- This is C - I'm not going to learn Morse code
at 3:00 in the morning!
All right
Don't come in here, don't come in here
What's going on?
Ramona's sleeping on the couch
I know When is she going home?
Never That's the problem
- I need your help - What are you talking about?
I'm invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement
That only applies if you need me
to help you destroy an artificial intelligence
you've created that's taking over the Earth
Come on! Don't nitpick!
Good night
All right
I'm invoking our Body Snatchers clause
The Body Snatchers clause requires me to help you destroy
someone we know who's been replaced with an alien pod
She's in the living room Go I'll wait here
Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?
Now! Do it!
You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing
to perform at optimum levels Now come on
Godzilla clause?
Not unless she destroys Tokyo
Rats
I've got it!
I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox
with my theory of string-network condensates!
It's unbelievable! It's paradigm-altering
I could not have done it without you
Please, I just offered a little encouragement
It was a lot more than that
You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions
and you pumiced my hammer toe
How can I ever repay you?
Would you consider naming it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?
Who's Nowitzki?
I'm Nowitzki
You want me to share credit?
Get out!
Bite me!
Sisters?
Excuse me, Dr Cooper
I'm Kathy O'Brien I just finished reading your paper
reconciling the black hole information paradox
with your theory of string-network condensates,
and it just took my breath away
Maybe when I publish it, I'll include an inhaler
Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?
Let's see Today's Thursday
Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo's
Sausage, mushrooms, light olives
Great I'll bring it to your place
I have the address
What a nice girl
Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?
Yes, I'm getting a free pizza
I'm on a roll
More pad Thai, please
Sheldon, you've already had four servings
You might want to slow down a bit
Just one more bite
Are you okay?
I'm just so
full
That's it No more Thai food
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Time!
All right, Klingons, pencils down
Okay, I have "pokh"
Have it Got it
"Potl"
Yup Have it Have it
"Pukhpa"
Have it Got it Yup
I have "chorrr"
Got it Yup
-"Nekhmakh" -Yeah Yeah
And "kreplach"
Hold on a second "Kreplach?"
Yeah
That isn't Klingon; it's Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling
Well, as it turns out, it's also a Klingon word
Really? Define it
"Kreplach": A hearty Klingon dumpling
Judge's ruling?
Bilurrrbe
Hey, guys, I need to use your TV
What's wrong with your TV?
I don't know It just died
I'm getting a bunch of static
Did you pay your cable bill?
Ugh, you sound just like the cable company
All right, so, shh!
Tyra Banks is about to kick
someone off America's Next Top Model
Excuse me, Penny, but we're
No, no, don't tell her
playing Klingon Boggle
Aw
What do you mean, "Aw"?
Like she didn't know we were nerds?
All right, if you must watch,
then mute it with closed captions, please
Fine
All right, Boggle warriors kapla'!
Look at those women
They're gorgeous
Oh! "Worf," nice! Too bad that's a proper noun
Oh, look, the's the future Mrs Wolowitz
No, wait, that's the future Mrs Wolowitz
With her head in the lap of
Oh, what a coincidence It's the future Mrs Wolowitz
Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother
The current Mrs Wolowitz
Is "qochbe'" spelled with a (gargling) or a (guttural grunt)?
Why is that Mrs Wolowitz crying?
That's Anais
None of the other girls in the house like her
House? What house?
They all live in a house together
A house, where?
I don't know Somewhere in LA
Wait a minute
You're telling me that I'm within driving distance
of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?
Yeah, I guess
And they live together and shower together and
have naked pillow fights?
Hey, wh-where are you going?
To pay my cable bill
All right, pencils down!
I have "lokh," "makh," and "cherrrkh"
Anybody got those?
Did I miss anything?
Did they kick Giselle off?
Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot
was an embarrassment
Sadly, Mrs Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine
Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed
Sheldon, the food's here
Ooh, there's the house
Freeze frame, freeze frame
What are you doing?
Marking the star positions and physical landmarks
so we can find the house of the supermodels
Why?
Isn't it obvious?
Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl,
making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem
Aka the future Mrs Howard Wolowitz
-Is my hamburger medium well? -Yes
-Dill slices, not sweet? -Yes
-Individual relish packets? -Yes
-Onion rings? -Yes
-Extra breading? -I asked
-What did they say? -No -Did you protest?
-Yes -Vociferously? -No
Well, then what took you so long?
Just eat
Hey, guys, what'd I miss? What'd I miss?
Giselle's hanging by a thread
Oh, good, I hate her
Then you're not invited to our wedding
Here you go
Thank you
Oh, do we have to suffer through this
transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?
Yes
You and I have a standing TV schedule,
which is the result of extensive debate and compromise
Any alterations except for breaking news
have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting
Put it on the agenda
But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda
Oh, I'll make a motion, but you're not going to like it
Fine Mock Parliamentary procedure
At least put it on mute
Oh, Giselle's not getting kicked off
It's totally going to be Summer
What?
Sheldon's onion ring Just put it back!
It's one onion ring
Just put it back before he comes!
No, no, no!
No, I don't think that's where it was
Okay, here he comes Deny, deny, people
Wall of silence
Who touched my
Penny! Penny did it
Why would you do that?
I don't know I was hungry?
What's the big deal?
The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate
All right Look, I didn't know, I'm sorry
Well, I'm sorry, but that is your second strike
What?
You have two strikes
Three strikes and you're out
It's a sports metaphor
A sports metaphor?
Yes, baseball
All right, yeah I-I'll play along
What was my first strike?
March 18th
You violated my rule about forwarding email humor
I did?
The photo of the cat who wants to "has cheezeburger"?
Oh, come on Everybody loves "LOL cats"
They're cute and they can't spell 'cause they're cats
I trusted you with my email address,
and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality:
strike one
Touching my food: strike two
Don't worry They only stay on your record for a year
You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class
Come on, I touched one onion ring
Yeah, and then you put it back,
compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings
Oh, honey, the buses don't go where you live, do they?
Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you,
but since you've become a permanent member of our social group,
I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else
Congratulations You're officially one of us
One of us, one of us
Well, what a thrill
You're sitting in my spot
Oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me
Leonard, she's in my spot
Yeah, yeah Uh, see, here's the thing
After you leave, I still have to live with him
I don't care I'm taking a stand
Metaphorically
All right, that's it Strike three
Ooh, strike three
I'm banished?
What the hell kind of crap is that?
Listen, don't worry I'll talk to him
Yeah, you do that
Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class?
You can do it online!
So based on our triangulation,
we've narrowed down the location of the Top Model house
to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills
Or possibly Durham, Noh Carolina
When we find it, you want to go with us?
To do what?
Party with the pretty girls, dude!
Are you insane?
You're not going to party with them
You're not even going to get anywhere near that place
That's what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon
No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong
The entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure
to put a man on the moon
Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out,
we will put a Wolowitz on one of America's top models
And a large number of people will believe it never happened
Okay, let me guess
A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard
Thank you
Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds
for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard
And for our suddenly "back on the Hindu wagon" Raj,
the meatlover's pizza, no meat
Coming right up
Wait Excuse me
You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger,
barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side
Oh, I didn't tell you?
You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory
Why?
Well, you have three strikes
One: coming in Two: sitting down
And three: I don't like your attitude
You can't do that
Not only is it a violation of California state law,
it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy
Yeah, no, there's a new policy:
No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon
I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena
Penny, can I talk to you for a minute?
Well, here's the thing
Um, I talked to Sheldon
and he feels terrible
and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line
Really? Well, that's great
Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?
What? I'm not going to apologize to that nutcase
Oh, come on It's easy
He'll even tell you what to say
Leard, don't you get it?
If you guys keep going along with his insanity,
you're just encouraging him
We're not encouraging
It's more like knuckling under
Look, I like hanging out with you guys,
but I'm not going to apologize for something I didn't do
Well, actually, technically, you did do it
That's strike one, Leonard
There you go: quesadilla
Salad
There's your pizza
And thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion
with my manager
one barbecue bacon cheeseburger,
barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side
Thank you
Go ahead Eat it
I dare you
That's it There's the house
I foundAmerica's top models!
Are you sure?
Look, on the roof
Anais and Giselle are sunbathing
European-style
You can recognize people on Google Earth?
Of course not
I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over
NORAD? You're using military aircraft?
It was already targeted to poke around
a nuclear reactor in Siberia
I took it an hour out of its way, tops
Okay, where is he?
Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store Why?
Here Try and go online
Problem with the WiFi? Just try
Greetings, hamburger toucher
You are probably wondering
why you cannot IM with your little friends
about how much you "heart" various things
This recorded message is alerting you
that I am putting an end
to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi
If you want to remedy the situation,
you can contact the phone company,
set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me
Well?
I reiterate: knuckle under
No, no, no, no, no It is on
I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt
Oh, Penny, you don't want to get into it
with Sheldon
The guy is one lab accident away
from being a supervillain
I don't care I was in junior rodeo
I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds
No need to neuter the nerd
I can get you back online
There, see? Problem solved
Voil?
SHELDON: Hello, puny insects
As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will,
everyone is awarded one additional strike
Thanks a lot, Howard
What are you complaining about?
I'm the one who has to take the class again
Hello
Time to do your laundry, huh?
It's Saturday night
Saturday is laundry night
I know
Every Saturday at 8:15
Easy to anticipate
What are you implying?
I'm implying that you're a creature of habit
And if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry
on Saturday at 8:15,
you might find it
unpleasant
Knuckle under? My ass
Oh, no, are all the machines taken?
What are you gonna do?
No problem
I'll just do my laundry another night
Another night?
Well, I guess you can try,
but deep inside your heart,
you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night
Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken
Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie
Sheldon Sheldon!
Sheldon
Yes?
Where are my clothes?
Your clothes? Yes, I left them in the washers
and when I went down to get them, they were gone
Really?
Despite the sign that says "Do not leave laundry unattended"?
Sheldon, where are my clothes?
You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments
Where was that?
Oh, yes
Earlier this evening,
I happened to gaze out the window
and a brassiere caught my eye
Do those look familiar?
How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
When you understand the laws of physics, Penny,
anything is possible
And may I add: mwuh-ha-ha
Get them down
Apologize Never
Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick
and play panty pinata
Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay?
I've done some stupid things
You've done some stupid things
How about we just call it even and move on with our lives?
I've done no stupid things
Look, you've got to meet me halfway here
I am meeting you halfway
I'm willing to concede that you've done stupid things
Hey, you guys are talking again Good
What happened?
Leonard, remember when I said it was on?
Well, now it's junior rodeo on
Oh, not junior rodeo
What did you do?
I had no choice, Leonard
She ruined laundry night
Mwuh-ha-ha
Telephone wires can't electrocute you, can they?
No Look, this has to stop
Oh, no, no, no It is just beginning
All right, I really didn't want to do this, but
here
What's this?
Sheldon's Kryptonite
Oh, my God
He can never know that I gave that to you
Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but
but this?
It'll shorten the war by five years
and save millions of lives
Oh, pause it That's it Confirmed
We now have the address of the Top Model house
God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark
Okay, for the record,
what you're doing is really creepy
You know what? If it's "creepy"
to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft
to find a house full of gorgeous young models
so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly,
then fine, I'm "creepy"
Hello
Oh, hi Yeah, hold on a second I'll get him
Sheldon, it's for you
Who is it? Your mother
Oh, good
Hi, Mom How are you?
But, Mom
she keeps sitting in my spot
And-and she touched my food
Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it
No, that's not fair
Why should I have to apologize?
Yeah, I really don't think this is the kind of thing
Jesus concerns himself with
No, you're right
I don't really know what Jesus thinks about
All right, good-bye
Did you tell on me?
Are you kidding me?
I already have two strikes
Penny Penny
Penny
I am very, very sorry for what I have done
Here's your laundry
I rescind your strikes
and you are no longer banished
Can I sit wherever I want?
Never mind, never mind
That's, that's not important
Sheldon, this was big of you
Thank you I really appreciate it
Thank you
Good night, Sheldon
Penny
Yes?
Well played
Thank you
Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility
Understood
Can I help you
Yes, we here to fix the cable
I think we have satellite
That's what I meant
Oh Okay, come on in
She's taller than all the women in my family combined
What do we do now?
Follow Mrs Wolowitz
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Oh, look, Saturn 3 is on
I don't want to watch Saturn 3  Deep Space Nine is better
How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3 ?
Simple subtraction will tell you it's six better
Compromise Watch Babylon 5 
In what sense is that a compromise?
Well, five is partway between three Never mind
I'll tell you what How about we go rock-paper-scissors?
I don't think so
Anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors,
players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time
due to the limited number of outcomes
I suggest rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock
- What? - It's very simple
Scissors cuts paper Paper covers rock
Rock crushes lizard Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes scissors Scissors decapitates lizard
Lizard eats paper Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes rock
And as it always has, rock crushes scissors
Okay, I think I got it
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock!
Hello, boys
Ahoy, matey
Noticed the eye patch, did you?
It's all part of a technique I've been studying for picking up women
You employ a visual display
designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable
Oh, yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage
or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters
Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye
Mock me if you will, but it works
You show up at a club in something distinctive,
scope out your target and toss out some negs
- What are negs? - A neg is a negative compliment
that throws a pretty woman off her game,
like "Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth,
but on you, they work"
I got a whole list of 'em Who wants to be my wingman?
You're not gonna need a wingman You're gonna need a paramedic
Your scooter's blocking my car
Did you get pinkeye again?
Step one: she notices the eye patch
May I say, Penny,
not a lot of women could look as hot as you do
with such greasy hair?
Just move your stupid scooter
before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster
Subtitles: sub-wayfr
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to watch The Clone Wars TV series
until I've seen The Clone Wars movie
I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended
I want to watch it now
Then I believe we've arrived at another quintessential
rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment
Watch whatever you want
I saw what you did there
What'd I do?
What's wrong?
- Okay, we'll be right there - What happened?
Howard's at the Mars Rover lab He says he's in trouble
Defcon 5
Defcon 5?
Well, there's no need to rush
- What? - Defcon 5 means "no danger"
Defcon 1 is a crisis
How can 5 not be worse than 1?
Star Trek V worse than I 
First of all, that's a comparison of quality, not intensity
Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse
than Star Trek V 
Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard
against which all badness is measured
No, no
Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction,
while Star Trek I fails across the board:
art direction, costuming, music, sound editing
Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
Star Trek V 
Will you at least stipulate
that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?
I have three words for you: Wrath of Khan
- Thank God, you're here - What's the emergency?
I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch
Where?
On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield
Where do you think? On Mars!
Is everything okay?
Yeah, baby, I'll be right in
You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
Yeah, I picked her up in the bar She's a doctor
One free barium enema,
and my mother won't care she's not Jewish
Wait a minute So the eye patch and the insults worked?
No, there were three other guys with eye patches It was a fiasco
What did work was, "How'd you like to visit a secret government facility?"
So what exactly do you want us to do?
You and Raj help me get the Rover out of the ditch
and you get Stephanie out before somebody notices her
- She doesn't exactly have clearance - Really?
They don't let strange women from honky-tonks
come in and play with $200 million government projects on distant planets?
Yes, I was bad Maybe she'll spank me
Can we please move on?
It's getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?
No I'm sorry, but something's come up
Kind of a Mars Rover
Mars Rover can Howard come over
situation
So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home
Okay Let's go, friend Leonard
- I'll call ya - So are you a scientist like Howard?
No one's a scientist like Howard
My mother is so gonna love her
How nice Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison
I'm sorry I totally interrupted you
What were you saying?
Just said Howard's a terrific guy
He's got a great sense of humor
He loves his mother
a lot
People say "too much"
I really like that you're such a loyal friend
Yeah, I am loyal
If you look at the big picture
Out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?
Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch
Then why did you?
He said that I could drive a car on Mars
Got it
So, can I see you again?
You're not gonna see me now
Cool
Anything?
Actually, I was just checking my e-mail
But, no, the Rover is not responding
I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement
and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion
Hang on There's got to be other options
You could try calling Triple-A
But based on NASA's latest timetable, they won't get there for 35 years
Plus I understand you have to be standing
next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive
Oh, snap
Snap what?
- I guess we have to turn to Plan B - What's Plan B?
Erase hard drives, scrap surveillance tapes,
wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run
Why wasn't that Plan A?
A NASA spokesman states that due to the loss of data, 
they will most likely be unable to determine the cause 
of the Mars Rover's malfunction 
Thank God for Plan B
Didn't you say you worked on the Mars Rover?
No, you're mistaken
When we first met,
you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars
I don't know what you're talking about
Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signaling
that he'd like to talk to me in private
No I remember specifically
You started by asking if I was from Mars
because my ass was out of this world
That does sound like me, but no
Is there some problem?
Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while
- All right, good-bye - No, wait!
If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know
- Where are you going? - I can't tell you that
Who would ask me?
I can't tell you that, either
You brought me in here to inform me you can't tell me where you're going
and you can't tell me who might ask?
Yeah, I really didn't think this through
- Leonard, a moment - What?
If someone, and of course, we don't know who this would be,
does ask where you've gone, what should I say?
I don't know Just tell 'em I went to the office
- Are you going to the office? - No
Then how can I say it convincingly?
Just say, "Leonard went to the office"
All right Leonard went to the office
What is? No, not like that!
- Just, "Leonard went to the office" - It would've worked out a lot better
if you'd just told me you were going to the office
I'm going to the office
See? Why don't I believe you?
I'm going out for a while
Doesn't anyone want to know where he's going?
Okay, where is he going?
Leonard is going to the office
- So how was work today? - Busy
I removed an appendix, a gall bladder
and about a foot and a half of bowel
I'm hoping that was three different guys
No, just the one
He didn't make it
So, how was your day?
You know, I'm a physicist, so I thought about stuff
That's it?
I wrote some of it down
- Are you done eating? - Yeah
Good
If I knew you were waiting, I would've swallowed that lasagna whole
You've reached Dr Stephanie Barnett Leave a message 
It's me again, Howard 
If you're free Friday, 
maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place 
My mom cooks a hell of a brisket 
Let me know 
It's Howard 
I've had her brisket Melts in your mouth
Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom
Good idea
There's a bed in there, and I'm very, very, very pro-bed
You've reached Dr Stephanie Barnett Leave a message 
Hey, it's me again 
Just want to let you know 
the head count for dinner Friday has gone up 
My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs 
If anybody should ask, 
you're half-Jewish on your mother's side 
Okay, call me 
It's Howard 
Don't you think we should tell him you're not interested?
Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?
Dear God, no!
You've reached Dr Stephanie Barnett Leave a message 
Hey, it's me again 
My cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you 
so that means we're gonna have to move the dinner 
to a restaurant 
Tell her we're going to the Olive Garden! 
I have a coupon from the paper 
We're not going to the Olive Garden, Ma! 
Mr Bigshot with his Red Lobster 
I'll call you back when we firm up the details 
It's Howard 
- New shirts? - Yeah, a couple
- Nice - Thank you
So, who's the girl?
I'm sorry?
Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating
So what we did was in fact dating?
Well, yeah, we did have a date
Exactly Thank you
Do me a favor, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him
So, who is she?
- She's a doctor - Nice
A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?
Doctor doctor
Surgical resident
Smart, pretty
Let me ask you something
If your friend thinks he's dating someone,
but he's not because, in fact, you're dating her,
does that make you a bad person?
- That depends - On what?
Is that friend Wolowitz?
Screw him You're fine
Are you sure?
Well, have you slept with her yet?
You dog!
Good for you
- Does that change things? - No
- So why'd you ask? - I'm nosy
See ya
Howard, get the door!
Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks?!
Thank you I had no idea!
Hey, buddy What brings you to my little slice of hell?
Who is it?!
It's Leonard!
You're gonna have to play outside!
I'm not dressed to receive!
No one cares, Ma!
So, what's up?
Listen, I need to talk to you about something
Momentito
Yello
Thanks for calling me back I was worried
No, I understand
Sure, we can be friends Absolutely
Thanks for calling
You have a nice day, too
You are dead to me
Who gets the extra dumpling?
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock
Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock
How do we decide that?
- Hey, guys - Hello
Hi, Howard
Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm
in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased
He intends to act on this by not speaking to you,
feigning an inability to hear you when you speak
and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence
That's just ridiculous Why are you cooperating with him?
I don't make the rules, Leonard
Howard, come on I didn't plan on this
These things just happen
Usually not to me, but they do happen
Did someone just feel a cold breeze?
I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor
The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue
of a disembodied soul passing by
Screw it I'm just gonna eat the dumpling
- Come on in - Is this a bad time?
Yes, but I don't see a better one on the horizon
If it isn't Mrs Dead to Me
I'm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor
by acknowledging her existence I'm out
He just won't listen to me
Okay, I guess it'll just be the three of us then
Lisa's gonna be disappointed
Lisa?
My roommate She just went through a really bad breakup,
I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you
Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive!
It's a miracle!
So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again
how much I enjoyed the other night,
and again, I'm sorry for how it ended
But again, if you could let me know about Friday
My mother needs a head count
so she can know how big a brisket to get
Howard, look at this
Anyway, call me
It's Howard
It's unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, 
but one thing's certain: 
the data which it has sent back 
contain the first clear indications 
that there may have been life on Mars 
It's a scientific discovery 
that has staggering implications for all mankind 
Unfortunately, we'll never know who's responsible 
Son of a bitch
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Penny, hello
Hey, Sheldon
What is shaking?
I'm sorry?
It's colloquial, a conversation opener
So, do you find the weather satisfying?
Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?
What's wrong with you? You're freaking me out
I'm striking up a casual conversation with you
S'up?
Please don't do that
All right, but I'm given to understand that when you have something awkward
to discuss with someone,
it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat
So, this wasn't the awkward part?
All right
S'up?
Oh, good, I used that right
Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship
which includes a sexual component?
Okay, feeling the awkward now
Her name is Dr Stephanie Barnett
and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial
- Leonard told me - Good
What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me
To you?
See, of the handful of women Leonard's been involved with,
she's the only one I have ever found tolerable
Well, what about me?
The statement stands for itself
Aren't you sweet?
Anyway, should you have any interaction with her,
it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe
You say that now, but consider the following scenario:
You're sitting in your apartment, it's late, you're alone
Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone
and suddenly even Leonard
seems like a viable sexual candidate
Or a "hookup"
as it's referred to by today's urban youth
- Really? - Yes Now, should that happen,
I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido
I could think about you
Fine, whatever works
Always nice talking to you, Sheldon
Peace out!
Subtitles: sub-wayfr
This is very pleasant
Glad you're enjoying yourself
And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us
I stand corrected
You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb
A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter
is sufficient for each person
as it doubles in volume when cooked
- That's very interesting - Thank you
She doesn't mean it She's just being nice
Well, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball,
I guess I'll just have to pick it up
Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?
- No - Good
What's your favorite fruit?
Strawberries
Technically not a fruit, but all right
Where did you do your medical internship?
Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas
Really? That's where I was born!
You're kidding!
I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital
When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter
- Why, what happened? - Radiation burns
A little mishap while I was building my own CAT scanner
I'm sorry, you tried to build your own CAT scanner?
No, I didn't try, I succeeded
In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside
of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire
It led to an interesting expression in our house:
"Not a Snowball's chance in a CAT scanner"
Excuse me
When I come back, just for fun,
the subject will be alternative history
Specifically, how would the Civil War have gone differently
if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?
Look at that, there's even pasta left over
Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
I do Do you? Because frankly,
you've been in a foul mood since I sat down
Okay, here's my question Why did you sit down?
To help Look, if you fail at this relationship,
and history suggests you will,
then we risk losing the medical officer
that our landing party has always needed
What landing party?
You're Kirk, I'm Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty,
Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed
and now we've got McCoy
So, we're all standing around looking at the post-op X ray
and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity
one of my earrings
Oh, my God, what did you do?
What do you think I did?
I discreetly slipped off the other earring,
put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!
I have a bone to pick with you, sir
Hi, Sheldon
Hi, Stephanie I'm sorry I'm late,
but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation
What invitation?
"We're going to the movies"
What movie? What theater? What time?
If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you,
you couldn't have done a better job
Clearly I could have
It took me nearly 20 minutes to browse the history on your computer
to see what movie times you looked up
Wait here, I'll find us seats
- We have seats - Not the right seats
What is he doing?
He's finding the acoustic sweet spot
Does he always do this?
Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone
I am really sorry about this
No, it's fine You know, he's sweet
My apologies, you've been sitting in it all along
- You want to slide over one? - No, just sit here
Oh, yeah, this is it
What, Sheldon?
What, Sheldon?! What, Sheldon?!
Tell me what you see here
The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
This is Stephanie's Facebook page
Now, where it should say "in a relationship," what does it say?
"Stephanie Barnett is single"
Furthermore, earlier this evening,
she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike
Who's Mike?!
Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?
It's just her Facebook page
and we've only been going out a couple of weeks
You don't see it, do you? We're losing her
I'm going to make this very simple for you
You are not in this relationship
I am
Ergo, you have no say
in anything that happens between me and Stephanie
I'm afraid I can't allow that
Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104,
Section A: You are deemed unfit
and I hereby relieve you of your command
General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation
- Give me one good reason why not - Because this is not Star Trek !
What?
This is banana bread
This is a door knob
It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food
can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation
to come in and chat
Would you like to come in?
I suppose I could spare a few minutes
Were you robbed?
How can you be sure?
What do you want?
I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you,
but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship
- He's having problems with Stephanie? - She's sending virtual livestock
to random men on the Internet
If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data
Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did
that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks
- What? - Again, urban slang
In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency
So, what is the "down" and the "low"?
And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential,
so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom
We never got to the bedroom
Because?
All right, you know what? I'll tell you what happened
We were young,
we were very much in love,
but we could only communicate
through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house
It's not enough that you made me watch that movie,
but now you mock me with it?
Gentlemen, I have a question
about dating and relationships
You told me you were going to have the talk with him
I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me
More to the point, it's about finding a way
to keep Leonard and Stephanie together
I don't think you can
Why not?
Look at Leonard's record 27 days with Joyce Kim
During which she defected to North Korea
Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle
For which she awarded him the nickname "Speed of Light Leonard"
- And the three hour dinner with Penny - Which would have been two and a half
if they ordered the souffle when they sat down
Based on the geometric progression,
his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes
Yes, I'm aware of the math Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth
The issue remains
How do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?
If you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie,
your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet
Here's what you shouldn't do Don't shpritz him with that body spray
from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it
That doesn't work at all
No matter how much you put on
That's all you've got? Apocalyptic genocide
and "go easy on the cologne"?
What?
Zucchini bread
- Thank you - May I come in?
I see
Apparently, my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard
crossed some sort of line
I apologize
Well, thank you
Have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?
- Yes - Great
New topic
Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
What?!
I've been doing some research online, and apparently, female primates,
you know, apes, chimpanzees, you
They find their mate more desirable when he's courted by another female
Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting
the pheromones associated with ovulation
Which brings me back to my question Where are you
Clearly, I'm 14 days too early
All I'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria,
why can't they do something about lactose intolerance?
Leonard, you're going to have to let this go
You had a little cheese dip, you farted I thought it was cute
- You want some more wine? - Yeah, I mean
I assume I'm not driving anywhere tonight
What are you doing?
I have a craving for white asparagus
that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied
Excuse me
- What is wrong with you? - I'm helping you with Stephanie
By making constipated moose sounds?
When I fail to open this jar and you succeed,
it will establish you as the "alpha" male
You see when a female
witnesses an exhibition of physical domination,
she produces the hormone oxytocin
If the two of you then engage in intercourse,
this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain
which lay people naively interpret as "falling in love"
Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
Yes, actually it would, but let's see how the lid goes
I'm not strong enough, Leonard, you'll have to do it
- For God's sakes - Go ahead, it's pre-loosened
You want some help with that?
I got it
He's got it, and that's not surprising
It's something I long ago came to peace with
in my role as the beta male
Open it
- Are you okay? - No, I'm not
- I'm bleeding - Like a gladiator!
- Honey, you're going to need stitches - Stitches? With a needle?
Well, yeah, I mean, just a few
Yeah, hang on a sec
FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there
What a beautiful job Stephanie did
I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch,
but you can't argue with her results
It's a shame it won't scar
The war wound is a time-honored badge of masculinity
I can't remember a time when you weren't talking
Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male
were not aided by you bursting into tears
I did not burst into tears,
my eyes just got a little watery
Watery?
She stuck a needle into my hand!
Hey, how's my big cry baby?
I didn't cry
I'm just teasing you
But, yeah, you did
It's all good What do you say we get you home and put you to bed?
Are you still going to spend the night?
No, I think that you probably need to rest
She's right As long as you're vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated
Thank you, Dr Cooper
You're welcome, Dr Hofstadter
Okay, I'm going to go get your discharge papers
What?
You seem like a perfectly pleasant person
I can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you
Can you open this for me?
- Can I see your stitches? - Sure
Answering the question once and for all
why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school
- Leonard, congratulations - What for?
Your Facebook status update
Leonard Hofstadter is "in a relationship"
What? No, that's not right
Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did?
Speaking as an expert, way to look needy
Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks?
That's bold
It's not bold, it's a mistake
I didn't change my status
Well, then who did?
I had no choice He cried in front of her
You hacked my Facebook account?
It's hardly hacking
when you use the same password for everything, "Kal-El"
Are you insane? Now she's going to think I'm desperate
You've destroyed this relationship! And you know what the worst part is?
You don't even understand what you did wrong
because you can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
- In which I am not an expert - Don't even!
I don't want to hear another word out of you
What's wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well?
She just updated her Facebook status
"Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship
"with Leonard Hofstadter"
Really?
Look at that
I have a girlfriend
If I am permitted to speak again,
Dr Sheldon Cooper for the win
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
I don't see anything at all
You're the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound
Me, too
Is it a high-frequency whistle?
No, it's more of a relentless, narcissistic drone
There's no inflammation at all
Then it must be a tumor
Seriously doubt it
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies
Is that possible? I used to get those all the time
Even in church
If it is from a swirly, there something I can do
Circle, circle, dot, dot,
now you have a cootie shot!
- I'm going to bed - Okay, I'll be right in
It's not enough that she mocks me,
but that isn't even the correct procedure for a cootie shot
Do you understand that Stephanie's not here
to treat your imaginary ailments?
How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C?
Is that imaginary?
I don't think so
- Good night - One more thing
Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement,
- I'm calling an emergency meeting - You're not
Leonard moves the meeting not occur Is there a second?
None heard, the motion fails
I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you
on the progress in your relationship with Dr Stephanie
- Thank you - That being said,
we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon "cohabitation" rider
which has been activated now the two of you are living together
- We're not living together - I beg to disagree
"A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard
when she has stayed over for A: ten consecutive nights,
or B: more than nine nights in a three week period,
or C: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights
That's absurd
You initialed it See? LH, LH, LH
Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen!
I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers
Yes, you did
Now, to review, the following provisions are hereby activated:
In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having
two separate shelves and one communal shelf,
the three of us now get individual shelves
and the door becomes communal
Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week
to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells
Third, the bathroom schedule I'm given to understand
women have different needs, so, we'll have to discuss that
I'm going to bed
At least take this with you
And have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here
and here
This states that she does not now
nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument
Sure sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve
Subtitles: sub-wayfr
No, absolutely not
It's not a big deal We have latex gloves
I don't care what the symptoms are,
my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam
Hi, Sheldon
Good morning, Dr Stephanie
I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night
We don't ask questions like that
I heard you ask it over and over
How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
- He did very nicely - See? She's not offended
And now you finally have an answer
Out of coffee Need coffee
Hi! Stephanie, right?
And-And you are?
Penny, I live across the hall
- I've heard a lot about you - Really?
I haven't heard a thing about you
Why haven't I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall
and comes into your apartment in the morning
in her underwear?
She's heard about you because we're,
you know, involved and you haven't heard about her because
I never slept with her, I swear!
In Leonard's defense, it wasn't for lack of trying
- Thank you - You're welcome
Look, I'm just saying
Penny is one of our many neighbors,
and in our building, neighbors come and go,
it's very casual, no dress code
In fact, some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor
in my pajamas and have cereal with Mrs Vartabedian
Really?
I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs Vartabedian
She doesn't like you
You have a gall bladder to remove
and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so
- It was very nice meeting you - Nice to finally meet you, too
- And I'll see you tonight? - Okay, bye-bye
What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs Vartabedian?
So, that's Stephanie, huh?
Why do I feel like I'm the one that just got the prostate exam?
You know, she seems very nice
Oh, she is She's terrific
And she's proving to be a valuable roommate
Roommate? You guys are living together?
Like hippies
We're not living together
Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
- We're not living together - Are you sure?
How could I not be sure?
Well, let's find out
Don't you think if a woman was living with me
I'd be the first one to know about it?
Sweetie, you'd be the last one to know about it
Cute dresses
I bet this looks great on you!
We're not living together
Scented candles, fuzzy slippers,
Floral bed sheets?
- We're not living together - Okay, moving on
Now, who are these guys at Disney World?
The big dog is Goofy,
and the older couple with the mouse ears, I have no idea
We're not living together!
You're going to go down swinging, huh?
All right, well, we got your body lotion,
your InStyle Magazine, your jewelry box
We're not
Where's my Bat Signal?
You have a Bat Signal?
I did
It was right here
She must've
Oh, my God, we're living together
Really? What was your first clue?
New pants?
Yeah, Stephanie got them for me
Nice Cotton?
Actually, I think it's more of a wool, fire ant blend
So, the girlfriend's buying clothes for you Sounds serious
It is actually
In fact, I gave it a lot of thought
and I decided it was time for us to live together
Leonard, huge mistake
There's a whole buffet of women out there
and you're just standing in the corner
eating the same deviled egg over and over again
At least I have an egg What do you have?
A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners
See the blonde over there?
I can hit on her and you can't
So, go hit on her
She's not my type
Too bad, 'cause she was checking you out before
- She was? - Of course not Look at her
I don't care what you guys think
Stephanie and I are very happy living together
I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me
What are you doing here?
Hang on
130 over 80
It's a little high
We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk
Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday
She thought if I failed at theoretical physics
that I should have a trade to fall back on
And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer
Thank you
Didn't they teach you that in medical school?
- I'm busy here, Sheldon - I understand
All I need is for you to authorize these tests
A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram,
a CBC, baseline glucose Upper GI?
And an exploratory laparoscopy
Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm
was just going through the motions
Go home
Can I at least have the upper GI?
I already drank the barium!
Good Do you have any fabric softener?
Yeah, sure
What are you washing? A crocodile?
No, the pants that Stephanie got me
Sweetie, you can't machine wash these They'll be ruined
- Are you sure? - Absolutely
I wish you'd told me that sooner
- Are you guys having problems? - No, everything's fine
Really?
Yeah, it's wonderful
Maybe this whole living together
happened kind of suddenly, but it's fine, it's great
You know, if you're uncomfortable with the way things are going,
you're allowed to say something
Are you sure? That doesn't sound right
Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers
No, that doesn't sound right either
Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace
that you both are comfortable with
Yeah, I could say something like that to her
I'll go do that
Thank you
Sure
You have a really good grasp on this
Maybe you could talk to her?
You're kidding, right?
No, but that's okay
I'll go talk to her
Want to come with?
Go!
What?
You were right Your larynx is terribly inflamed
I've never seen anything like it
I knew it!
What do I do?!
You're going to need to stop talking immediately
For how long
Immediately
What's going on?
I just performed a "Sheldonectomy"
Careful, if you don't get it all, it'll only come back worse
Gotcha
We need to talk
Do we need to talk or "do we need to talk"?
I don't know what that means
Why don't you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?
Look, it's just that
things between you and me have been going pretty quick
And?
It's just a little scary
Well, yeah, but scary good, right?
Sure
When is scary not good?
But
I have feelings, right?
Okay, and it's perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?
Of course, honey, why don't you tell me what it is you're feeling?
Okay, well, I think it's important to remember
that we move at a pace
that is our speed and
Oh, shoot, I had it!
How about this? How about I tell you what I'm feeling?
What's that?
Really? Right now?
Why not?
I just ate, aren't you supposed to wait an hour?
I think that's for swimming
I just hope I don't get cramps
- I put your clothes in the dryer - Thank you
- Your pants are ruined - Good
So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?
On one level, really
really well
So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?
Not specifically,
but I did tell her that I had feelings
Good, good
And then what?
And then
the subject got changed somehow
You had sex, didn't you?
Little bit
What?
Nothing
Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out
It's all good
Everything's going to work out One way or another
God, come on, Leonard,
you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to
- Really? - Yes!
You don't always have to go along with what the woman wants
What?
Nothing Just rethinking my whole life
Here's the thing
I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out,
she'll just dump me
It's a chance you have to take
I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be
Very comforting
What do I say to her?
I don't know What have women said to you
when they wanted to slow a relationship down?
I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?
Yeah, that'll slow it down
I'm sorry, I totally interrupted you What were you saying?
Right, yeah
Here's the thing
I really like you
God, here comes the speech
What speech?
"I really like you,
"but maybe we should spend a little less time together
"'cause I need my space
"but I'll call you on Tuesday"
and then you never call me, so I call you,
but you don't call me back and then when I run into you
at the coffee shop, you pretend like you've been having problems
with your voice mail and I know that you're lying,
but I pretend like I don't care
even though I'm dying inside!
I wasn't going to say any of that
I was just going to say
I really like you
Oh, good!
'Cause I really like you, too
Terrific
Nice sweater
Stephanie got it for me It's kind of fun
It's got a big bird on it, dude
Yeah, yeah, that's the fun part
We're also getting new curtains for my bedroom,
and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don't even know what a duvet is,
but I'm pretty sure if I did I wouldn't want one,
but every time I talk to her about moving out,
she cries and we have sex
You're lucky With me, it's usually the other way around
You know, if you can't talk to her, why don't you just text her?
- Isn't that kind of cowardly? - Yeah, it's beyond contemptible
True,
but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater
Sold
"I think it would be better for our relationship
"if you moved back to your place"
There
- It's done - Good for you
Good for me
I'll never have sex again
I was wrong See ya
I have an inflamed larynx 
We are out of herbal tea 
Do you have any? 
Okay, let me check
Some hiney would be nice, too 
Hiney?
Honey
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Your argument is lacking on all scientific merit
And it is well established, Superman cleans his uniform
by flying into Earth yellow Sun, which incinerate any contaminate matter
and leaves the unvulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh
What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?
- Like what? - I don't know Kryptonian mustard
I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments
were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded
Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite,
the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth
Raj, please, let's stay serious here
Superman's body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian
What about Kryptonian pit stains?
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth
He's invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers
Before dinner, his host says,
"Who's up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?"
Superman says "Sure," works up a sweat, comes back to Earth,
his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration
Boo ya
Superman would have taken his uniform
to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle
"Kandorian dry cl" I give up
You can't have a rational argument with this man
Isn't that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year?
No, not all at once
Then how?
Leonard
Now, Raj
Now, Sheldon
I didn't get a good look Can I go again?
- It's David Underhill So what? - So what?
His observation of high-energy positrons has provided
the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter
I have two words for you The first is "big," the other's "whoop"
It is a big whoop
It made almost all the work you've done completely useless
- Did not - Did, too
Okay, maybe some of it, but
The guy was just in the right place, at the right time
with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe
He got lucky
In more ways than one
He's a very handsome man
Doesn't do anything for me If I was gonna go that way,
I'm more of a Zac Efron kinda guy
Yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Efron
Excuse me Are you Leonard Hofstadter?
I'm David Underhill
Dr Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up
in the photomultiplier lab, that you'd be able to give me a hand?
- You want to work with me? - If you have a little time
Sure
Yeah, no problem
Here's my home number Here's my cell
Here's my office
Here's my parents' number up in New Jersey
They always know how to reach me
Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way Big fan
Thanks I'll call you
Bye-bye!
What are you looking at? You've never seen a hypocrite before?

Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike
if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper,
who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68
Hey, guys!
That doesn't count Do over! Do over!
There are no do-overs in Wii bowling
There are always do-overs when my people play sports
Where were you that's more important than Wii bowling night?
- Actually - It's rhetorical
There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night
Come on, it's just a video game And we suck at it
Nice motivational speech from the team captain
- Where were you? - I was working with Dave Underhill
"Dave" Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF
Actually, he's pretty cool Not only is he a brilliant scientist,
but it turns out he's a Black Diamond skier
He collects vintage motorcycles He plays in a rock band
So? We're in a rock band
No
We play Rock Band on our X-Box
Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist
He's funny, too
He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex
What are you wearing?
That's not He does it better
He said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow,
so I'm gonna go practice my situps
Humongous man crush, dude
Yeah It's officially a bro-mance
Are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?
No, because we don't celebrate
the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia
- Saturnalia? - Gather round, kids,
it's time for Sheldon's beloved Christmas special
In the pre-Christian era,
as the winter solstice approached and the plants died,
pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes
as an act of sympathetic magic,
intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring
This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans
and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree
And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about
Thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard
a few silly neighbor gifts, so I'll just put them under my tree
Wait! You bought me a present?
Why would you do such a thing?
'Cause it's Christmas?
I know you think you're being generous,
but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity
You haven't given me a gift You've given me an obligation
Don't feel bad, Penny, it's a classic rookie mistake
My first Hanukah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights
You don't have to get me anything in return
Of course I do The essence of the custom
is that I now have to go out and purchase a gift of commensurate value
and representing the same perceived level of friendship
as that represented by the gift you've given me
It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year
Forget it I'm not giving you a present
It's too late I see it That elf sticker says, "To Sheldon"
The die has been cast The moving finger has writ,
Hannibal has crossed the Alps
I know It's funny when it's not happening to us
Sheldon, I am very, very sorry
No, I brought this on myself
by being such an endearing and important part of your life
I'm going to need a ride to the mall
It's happening to us
- Are you gonna make it? - Yeah, I guess
Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle
No problem
I had no idea it was so heavy
The thing just fell right over on me, didn't it?
Yeah Lucky for you it wasn't moving
Hey, Leonard Are you okay?
It's just a little motorcycle accident
My God, how fast were you going?
I don't know It's all such a blur
Good one He couldn't even get it started
- Hi Dave - Hi
Penny So it's your motorcycle?
- Is it okay? - It's fine
Lucky for the bike it landed on my leg
You mind giving me a hand with Speed Racer here?
- How do you know Leonard? - I'm a physicist
No, you're not
Why is that so surprising?
Well, it's just that the physicists I know
are indoorsy and pale
I'm not indoorsy I just wear the appropriate sun block
because I don't take melanoma lightly
So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?
- Actually we are - We're examining the radiation levels
of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector
Sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking
You know, I love science
- Since when? - Since always
Call me a geek, but I am just nuts
for the whole subatomic particle thing
The last thing I would ever call you is a geek
Well, that's what I am queen of the nerds
If you like, I could show you the lab we're working in
We've got some cool toys, you know, lasers and stuff
You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab
- Since when? - Since always
Leonard, are you okay here?
- I guess - How about we go see it now?
Maybe afterwards we take the bike, we grab a little bite to eat
Yeah, that sounds great Let me just get my jacket
Boy, she'll do, huh?
Yeah, if you like that type
So, you and her?
- No, just neighbors - Really?
I don't know how you live next door to that
without doing something about it
Actually
science is my lady
- Okay Let's go - All right
- See you tomorrow, Leonard - See ya
Have fun
Did you forget your key?
I don't see anything in here a woman would want
You're kidding
You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps
That's the estrogen hat trick
What it is is a cacophonous assault
of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla
It's as if my head were trapped in the pajamas of a sultan
If you don't like this stuff, let's go next door and build her a bear
I told you before, bears are terrifying
Come on,
bath stuff It's perfect!
You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff,
spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation
That presupposes Penny is tense
She knows you She's tense We all are Buy a basket!
- Excuse me, we're ready - No, we're not
Let's say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis,
I now lay the following conundrum at your feet:
Which size?
This one Let's go
- You put no thought into that - I'm sorry
This one Let's go!
I have insufficient data to proceed
Excuse me, miss?
If I were to give you this gift basket,
based on that action alone and no other data,
infer and describe the hypothetical relationship
that exists between us
Excuse me?
Here
Now, are we friends?
Colleagues? Lovers?
Are you my grandmother?
I don't understand what you're talking about
and you're making me a little uncomfortable
See? Sounds just like you and Penny We'll take it
- Leonard Come, join us - Hey, Dave
And Penny, what a surprise
Dave was just showing me around the university
This place is unbelievable!
I know, I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half
You always said you had yoga
- I never said that - Maybe I heard you wrong
A lot of words sound like "yoga"
This is an amazing woman She has a curious and agile mind,
not to mention being curious and agile in other respects
Shut up!
Yes, please shut up
So Dave,
don't you think you and I should get back to the lab?
You know, that dark matter isn't going to detect itself
Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off
so I could work on another experiment with Penny
Really? We're going to do an experiment?
We're going to explore the effects of tequila shots
on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman
It's not an experiment! You saw what happened last night
- You ready to go? - Yeah
- Can I drive the motorcycle? - Yeah, why not?
You can't do any worse than Leonard
That's funny
By the way, my leg is killing me Thanks for asking
Great news, Leonard
I've solved my Penny gift dilemma
Yippee
You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate,
but I have devised a foolproof plan
See, I will open her gift to me first
and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress
Then
I'll look up the price of her gift online,
choose the basket closest to that value,
give it to her
and then I'll return the others for a full refund
Brilliant
It is, isn't it?
Is it okay if I hide them in your room?
The smell makes me nauseated
- Do whatever you want - Thank you, that's very gracious
Gentlemen
Why couldn't you have just done what Leonard did
and get Penny a new boyfriend?
My leg is killing me Thanks for asking
I have just one question for you
While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us,
you said you didn't want to go out with me
because I was too smart for you!
News flash, lady:
David Underhill is ten times smarter than me!
You'd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain
for me to beat him at checkers!
Next to him, I'm like one of those sign-language gorillas
who knows how to ask for grapes!
So, my question is
What's up with that?!
Why are you yelling at me?
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Never mind, we're cool
Dave is not smarter than you He's an idiot
Really? Why would you say that?
Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife
off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos
of his girlfriend
He tried to take nude photos of you?
That's what you took from that?!
The guy is married!
I'm so Oh, that's terrible
And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us,
why are you so jealous?
The important thing is he's married and that's terrible!
Nice save, genius
Eggnog?
Lactose
It's just rum It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago
Smooth
Smoother than you
Come on, it's Christmas, just give me this one
Merry Christmas
By the way, my leg is killing me Thanks for asking
Merry Christmas How's your leg?
Very good, thanks for asking Come on in
Good, Penny, you're here to exchange gifts
You'll be pleased to know I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer
Okay, here
I should note I'm having some digestive distress,
so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don't be alarmed
A napkin
Turn it over
"To Sheldon,
"live long and prosper
"Leonard Nimoy"
He came into the restaurant
Sorry the napkin's dirty He wiped his mouth with it
I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
Yeah, I guess But look, he signed it
Do you realize what this means?!
All I need is a healthy ovum
and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
All I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon
Be right back
Here Open it
A gift cerficate for motorcycle lessons
- Very thoughtful - Yeah, and I checked
Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still
is lesson one
Then, I think you'll appreciate what I got you
"101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids"
You know, 'cause you're so into science
Sheldon! What did you do?!
I know!
It's not enough, is it?
Here
Leonard, look! Sheldon's hugging me
It's a Saturnalia miracle
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Gentlemen, I put it to you:
the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding
of any other flavor
First off, that is axiomatically wrong
because the best pudding is chocolate
Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca
makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death
- It is extracted from the plant - I'm thinking of growing a mustache
No kidding? Fu Manchu, a handlebar, pencil?
- It's extracted from - I'm not sure yet
- George Clooney has one now - Really?
I once saw him shopping at Ralph's He was buying tequila
You'd thinka guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey
This is cruel We'd better let him finish before his head explodes
All right, why is tap?
Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta!
Due to a high concentration of cyanide, it is poisonous in its raw form
and lethal if prepared improperly!
Feel better now?
It is also indigenous to Brazil as is the cocoa bean,
from which we get chocolate, the best pudding
You promised you wouldn't do that anymore!
Hey, Hofstadter
Hey, Kripke
Heard about your latest anti-proton decay experiment
20,000 data runs
and no statistically significant results Very impressive
What a jerk
Don't feel bad Negative results are still results
Even 20,000 of them
All right!
Please don't cheer me up anymore
Don't let him get to you It's Kripke
He's a ginormous knob
That's why he eats by himself
instead of sitting here at the cool table
For shizzle
It's true Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted
But he also controls the new open science grid computer
that I need to use to run some simulations
of structure formation in the early universe
Good luck getting time on it
The only people he lets use it are his friends
Then the solution is simple I shall befriend him
What would you say to the idea of you and I becoming friends?
I would say I have no interest in becoming your friend
Really?
That seems rather shortsighted coming from someone
who is generally considered altogether unlikable
Why don't you take some time to reconsider?
Yeah, I'll do that
I think we're off to a terrific start
Subtitles: sub-wayfr
There you go
Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder
Thanks The e-mail doesn't bother me
as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit
Yeah, I got the same one,
and that's not a bathing suit It's a tan line
Hello, this is Sheldon Cooper
I am leaving a message for Barry Kripke
It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria
I saw that you purchased the chef's salad
Apparently, you did not know
that the chef's salad is kitchen trickery to utilize scrap meat
Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it
I'm following up on our pending friendship
and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status
Sheldon Cooper
What's up with Ichabod?
He's trying to make a new friend
Really? Well, good for him
Unless he makes one out of wood like Geppetto,
I don't think it's gonna happen
How did you guys become friends?
There was a flyer on the bulletin board at the university:
"Roommate wanted Whistlers need not apply"
- And you moved in anyway? - I assumed he was joking
You'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side
What about Howard and Raj? How did he become friends with them?
I don't know How do carbon atoms form a benzene ring?
Proximity and valence electrons
Well, sure, when you put it that way
But it all worked out, right?
I suppose
I do miss whistling, though
Oh, come on Really?
First warning
This is for you
Hello, Sheldon
Hi
- What is this? - It's a questionnaire I devised
I'm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work
so I'm doing a little research to better understand
why my current friends like me
Yes, well, that is a good question
But is this really the best way to figure it out?
I agree
The social sciences are largely hokum
But short of putting electrodes in your brain
and monitoring your response to my companionship,
this is the best I can do
Okay, "Question one:
"Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper
"in order of appeal: Intelligence;
"ruthless attention to hygiene;
playfulness; JAVA applet writing"?
I know, I may have started out with a fairly obvious one;
an aspect of my most appealing trait: playfulness
Go ahead and rank that number one
I'm afraid you're on your own for the rest
It should take you no more than three hours
Wait How many questions are on this thing?
Only 211
Don't worry In deference to you, I kept them all
at a high school graduate reading level
Thanks, pal
You got it buddy
Honey, did you ever consider making friends by being,
I don't know, pleasant?
That's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis
May I suggest it as the topic for your essay?
Your questionnaire, very disappointing
I answered every question
You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern:
A-B-B-A-C A-B-B-A-C
Oh, you picked up on that?
How could I not?
Come on There's over 200 questions
And look at some of these things "Sheldon is to camaraderie
as the space shuttle is to blank?"
There are a number of acceptable answers
For example, "C: Near-Earth transport"
But certainly not "B: Avocado rancher"
And your essay suggesting that I'd have better luck
making friends if I wait till the Cylons take over?
Please
Hold on I put some real work into that
Yes, well, it's better than what Wolowitz did
He drew a raccoon
with what appears to be a distended scrotum
It's kinda cute
Until you get to the scrotum
What hope do I have for establishing new relationships
given that my current friends apparently could not take
a few hours out of their lives to help me?
I'm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon
I don't see how you could
What I'm trying to say is that maybe you can't approach this
as a purely intellectual exercise
What do you mean?
Remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the Internet?
I did learn how to swim
On the floor
The skills are transferable
I just have no interest in going in the water
- Then why learn how to swim? - The ice caps are melting
In the future, swimming isn't going to be optional
But you do bring up an interesting point
I don't have to break new ground here
I'm sure much of the research already exists
No, no, my point is,
if you want to learn how to make friends,
then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum
Meet people Talk to them Take an interest in their lives
That's insane on the face of it
- Where are we going? - You're driving me to the mall
I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories
in the field of friend-making
Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
Coping with the Death of a Loved One
- My condolences - Thank you
Family or friend?
- Family - Too bad
If it had been a friend, I'm available to fill the void
It's just as well She smelled like mothballs
If you're gonna start sniffing people, I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel
Excuse me
Do you have any books about making friends?
Yeah, but they're all for little kids
I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred
I guess
They're right over there by the wooden train set
I love trains
I bet you do
My, that's awfully sticky
All right, let's see
Bernie Bunny Has Two Daddies Now
That's probably about homosexual rabbits
Gerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus
Read it Not helpful
Here we go
Stu the Cockatoo Is New at the Zoo 
"Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana
"with her husband and best friend, Mark,
and their cockatoo Stu"
Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn't you agree?
I don't like birds They scare me
Me, too
Most people don't see it
- What are you reading? - Curious George 
I do like monkeys
Curious George is a monkey
Somewhat anthropomorphized, but yes
Say,
maybe sometime you and I could go see monkeys together
- Would you like that? - Okay
What are you doing?
I'm making friends with this little girl
- What's your name? - Rebecca
Hi, Rebecca I'm your new friend, Sheldon
No, you're not Let's go
- We were really hitting it off - Don't look up There's cameras
I'm curious In the "How well do you know Sheldon" section,
what did you put for his favorite amino acid?
Lysine
Damn it, I had lysine and changed it
Good, you're just in time
I believe I've isolated the algorithm for making friends
Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends
Hear him out If he's really onto something,
we could open a booth at Comic-Con Make a fortune
See, my initial approach to Kripke had the same deficiencies
as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo when he was new at the zoo
Stu the Cockatoo?
He's new at the zoo
It's a terrific book
I've distilled its essence into a simple flow chart
that will guide me through the process
Have you thought about putting him in a crate
while you're out of the apartment?
Hello, Kripke? Sheldon Cooper here
It occurred to me you hadn't returned any of my calls
because I hadn't offered any concrete suggestions
for pursuing our friendship
Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together
I see
Well, then perhaps you'd have time for a hot beverage?
Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa
I see
No, wait Don't hang up yet
What about a recreational activity?
I bet we share some common interests
Tell me an interest of yours
Really?
On actual horses?
Tell me another interest of yours
I'm sorry I have no desire to get in the water till I absolutely have to
Tell me another interest of yours
- He's stuck in an infinite loop - I can fix it
Interesting, but isn't ventriloquism by definition a solo activity?
Tell me another interest of yours
Is there any chance you like monkeys?
What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys
Hang on, Kripke
A loop counter
and an escape to the least objectionable activity
Howard, that's brilliant
I'm surprised you saw that
Gee, why can't Sheldon make friends?
All right, Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable,
and I would like to propose that we do that together
Tomorrow
Yes, I'll pay
All right, good-bye
All right
Time to learn rock climbing
You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism
Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage
He could talk while you drink
Nope I wanna climb some rocks
This appears significantly
more monolithic than it did on my laptop
One expects to see hominids learning to use bones as weapons
- You afraid of heights, Cooper? - Hardly
A fear of heights is illogical
A fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary
What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve
to cement our newfound friendship?
They have birthday parties here Little kids climb this
Little kid hominids perhaps
So is this your entire job?
Your parents must be so proud
- Let's go, Cooper - I'm coming, Kripke
The harness seems to be secure
A small amount of incontinence just now,
but the Web site said that's to be expected
This isn't so bad
It's like vertical swimming
Look at you
- You're almost halfway to the top - I am?
I was wrong
It is a fear of heights
- You all right there, Cooper? - Not really
I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function
that's approached an asymptote
- Are you saying you're stuck? - What part of inverse tangent function
approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
I understood all of it I'm not a moron
Just keep going
- Yeah, I don't think I can - Well, then climb back down
No, that doesn't seem any more likely
What's your plan?
Well, it's not exactly a plan,
but I think I'm going to pass out
Sorry, can we please just do it one more time?
One, two, one, two, three, and
It's a little thing, but you really do miss it
Hello, everyone
I brought my new friend Barry Kripke home for dinner
Hello to you, too
- How was rock climbing? - He passed out
Just hung there like a big salami
That's where I sit
You have a special spot? What kind of wacko are you?
How much time you got?
You want some Chinese food?
Terrific Got any dental floss?
In the bathroom
Be right back
I got to floss the Indian food out of my teeth
if I'm gonna eat Chinese
Sheldon, are you okay?
Yes, I pass out all the time,
but it was worth it
I've made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke,
which brings me to an awkward moment
What's that?
Maintaing five friendships
promises to be a Herculean task, so
I'm going to have to let one of you go
Me, me, let it be me
Leonard, you are my roommate,
my source of transportation,
and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer
You are safe
- Can I whistle? - Don't be silly
You do not have a PhD;
your cologne is an assault on the senses;
and you're not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays
Guilty as charged I'm out
You too are safe
Come on What do I have to do?
Okay, you know what? I see where this is going
I'm not one of you guys I'm not a scientist, so just tell me
Everything you're saying is true, but please allow me to continue
You're out
That's a good question
While you do provide a certain cultural diversity
to an otherwise homogenous group,
your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing
How could you for a moment think my favorite amino acid is glutamine?
He had lysine, but changed it
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, Raj
I like to floss before I eat
so my gum pockets are open for new food
How did I walk past you?
I'm Barry
That's not a very hot name
I'm going to call you Roxanne
Pot stickers
Suddenly, I'm looking pretty good, huh?
So, Kripke, I was wondering if there's any chance
you could get me some time on the open science grid computer?
But we're friends
I'm sorry
No, my friend
I'm confused I was given to understand
that you allow your friends time on the machine
No, that's wrong
There's an official schedule I have no control over it
This entire endeavor seems to have been an exercise in futility
Raj, you're back in
He likes monkeys
You've got to give him credit for sticking with it
I didn't think he had it in him
And he almost made it to the top this time
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
The problem appears to be unsolvable
Maybe we could run some computer simulations
There are too many variables It would take forever
We've got to be missing something
Let's start again
The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40,
here at 8:10 and here at 8:45
These theaters have to be eliminated
Why? They're state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound
Yes, but they have no Icee machines
Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add
What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific
They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines
No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that
It's gonna take at least an hour to eat,
and I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant
proximate to a Sheldon-approved theater
- We could eat after the movie - Unacceptable
The delay would result in tomorrow's bowel movement occurring at work
Hang on, hang on There's a 7-Eleven here
We smuggle Slurpees, which are essentially Icees,
in under our coats,
after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here
I don't see how we missed that
Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpees Icees?
That's how we missed it
Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis,
to create an emergency ad hoc Slurpee-Icee equivalency?
You know I can't do that
I guess we only have one option
I don't see any way around it
- Bye, Sheldon - See ya
They're right, it was the only option
Subtitles: sub-wayfr
Shut the door!
- Why? - Just do it!
- Get inside and shut the door - Well, you didn't specify
- Is Leonard around? - He went to the movies without me
It was the only option
I'm sorry, I don't understand which social situation this is
Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?
The building manager's showing an apartment downstairs,
- and I haven't paid my rent - Oh, I see
I'm not sure I'm comfortable harboring a fugitive
from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation
It's no big deal I'm just a little behind on my bills
because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down
If you recall, I pointed out the "check engine" light
to you several months ago
The "check engine" light is fine
It's still blinking away
It's the stupid engine that stopped working
It cost me like $1,200 to fix it
It occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money
Yes, it occurs to me, too
Hang on a moment
Here Take some
Pay me back when you can
- You got a lot of money in there - That's why it's guarded by snakes
- Take some - Don't be silly
I'm never silly
- Here - No, I can't
Don't you need money?
- Yeah, but - This is money I'm not using
But what if you need it?
My expenses account for 469% of my after-tax income
The rest is divvied up between a small savings account,
this deceptive container of peanut brittle
and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure
who shall remain nameless for his own protection
Or her own protection
- Take some - Really? I mean, are you sure?
I see no large upcoming expenditures
unless they develop an affordable technology
to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine
Are they working on that?
I sincerely hope so
Well, thank you
No, I can't
Honey, I don't want things to be weird between us
Won't it also be weird if I have to say hello to you
every morning on my way to work and you're living in a refrigerator box
and washing your hair with rain water?
- I'll pay you back as soon as I can - Of course you will
It's impossible to pay me back sooner than you can
Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality
I'm regretting this already
I've given the matter some thought, and
I think I'd be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens
Interesting
Ask me why
Do I have to?
Of course That's how you move a conversation forward
Why?
The learning opportunities would be abundant
Additionally, I like having my belly scratched
- Hey, Penny How was work? - Great
I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life
Was that sarcasm?
Was that sarcasm?
- Was that sar - Stop it!
- You appear to have a package here - Oh, thanks
This must be the beret I ordered
A couple of months ago It was back-ordered
Did you know the beret is an example
of a piece of women's fashion adapted from male military uniforms?
Another fascinating example is the epaulet
He's not lying He does find that fascinating
Whatever It's not like I'm running up and down the streets
just buying myself berets
I bought one a month ago, and it was back-ordered
- Look, it finally arrived, all right? - All right
Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?!
- Weird - Good, that was an unusual interaction
I wasn't sure
- Did you guys have an argument? - No
You clearly did something to aggravate her
I'm at a loss
If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions
and see if there's a blunder I overlooked
Here you go
You owe me another two dollars The price of moo shu pork went up
It's getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew
Here you go, Penny Shrimp with lobster sauce
- Thank you What's my share? - Don't worry about it It's my treat
Really, how much?
Whatever $10, $11
Which is it, $10 or $11?
$1450 But it's no biggie
You'll get the next one
What?
He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top
if he'd get his shrimp lo mein for free
What are you saying? That I'm using my body to get dinner?
That I'm some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?
Let me tell you something I pay my own way in this world, okay?
I don't rely on anybody!
What was that about?
He has a nervous bladder when he's stressed out
Kind of like a puppy
Here, Leonard $10, $11, $12 $14
It was $1450, but it's okay
Oh, good Dinner's here
Yes, and I'm having some I'm having takeout food
You're damn right it's okay I've been having leftovers at the restaurant
for like four days, and I wanted something different So sue me
Forgive me, but that would be
the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit
I will pay you back as soon as I can You just have to give me more time
- You lent her money? - She need money
You seem under pressure
Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more
You know, you would just love that, wouldn't you?
You would just love to open up your little snake can
and throw some money at the girl who can't pay her bills
- Where are you going? - Going home,
where I won't be interrogated like a criminal
I forgot my fortune cookie
In case either of you have larceny in your heart,
you should know that I've moved my money out of the snake can
But if you're ever short, there's always a couple of 50s in Green Lantern's ass
- Hey - Hey
A little mood lighting, huh?
When I didn't pay my bill,
the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience
Yeah, they're very considerate that way
I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent Then I had like $14 left over
$14, huh?
Put it back in your pocket, or I'll find some other place to put it
Back in the pocket it goes
You do understand
Sheldon really doesn't care when he gets the money back
It's actually one of the few idiosyncrasies
that doesn't make you want to kill him
Yeah, well, that's not really my big problem
So you're a little behind on your bills Everybody gets behind on their bills
I know, it's just This wasn't the plan
It wasn't supposed to go this way
What was the plan?
Waitress for six months and then become a movie star
- Was there a plan B? - TV star
It's probably not as bad as you think Let's take a look
Maybe we can find some corners to cut
Here's something
If you don't have electricity, then you probably don't need cable
Just a suggestion
$170 dollars for acting classes?
No, I can't give up my acting classes I'm a professional actress
You've had an acting job where you got paid?
That is not the definition of professional
Actually, it kind of Let's keep looking
What's $1,800 to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?
That's nothing
Nothing?
It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour
Remember Kurt?
Your ex-boyfriend?
He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car
- What? - He was drunk
I would hope so
He had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant,
so I, you know, I paid his fines
- Did he pay you back? - No, but he will
And that's based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people
who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money
- What are you gonna do? - I don't know,
but I may have to find a cheaper place to live
You don't want to do that
Why not?
Moving is a big deal
You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes,
and if they're not clean, your books smell like melons,
and it's like
Why don't you just get a roommate and stay here?
Do you know anybody?
I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn't mind moving in with you
Leonard, honey, if we started living together,
I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off you
Really?
And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money
This Moo Shu pork's burning a hole through my duodenum
Leviticus 11:3:
"Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud
among the beasts shall ye eat"
Do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita
every time you scarf down a Whopper?
- What's going on? - We're on a quest
through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown
You want the Valley of Fire? It's right here
You guys want to go on a real live quest?
Outside? I just made cocoa
- Come on It'll be fun - What is it?
Do you guys remember Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?
Yeah, that's him
Turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I'm gonna go get it from him
Who's with me?
Double sixes
Really? You're just gonna let me go by myself?
Cool, I got a sword
I could use some help
Here
You guys are unbelievable
You play a game to simulate adventure,
but when there's real adventure out there in the real world,
you just wimp out
Do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman,
we returned home without pants?
- I do - Are you sure?
Because your proposal suggests that you don't
- I'm not afraid of him - All right
Leonard fairly calls the question:
Who is in favor of abandoning our game
and confronting Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend
in a suicidal mission to extract money from him?
Say hi to Kurt for us
Excuse me
When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor,
didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?
- They did - Well?
They had a terrible time of it
Plus, no one stole their pants
Fine
Enjoy your little game I'll make this quest on my own
Wait
Take a jacket It's shpritzing a little
You guys suck
Come on, please? He's so big
Is everyone clear on the plan?
Koothrappali's going to wet himself,
I'm gonna throw up, Sheldon's gonna run away,
and you're going to die
Shall we synchronize our watches?
Guys, there are four of us and one of him
Which means his triumph will be even larger
Minstrels will write songs about him
How about this? I'll do the talking
You just stand behind me and try to look formidable
I should've peed before we left
- Hi, Kurt - Lenny, right?
I don't really go by Lenny, but that's okay
You remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj
- What do you want? - You don't remember me?
- How could he not rember me? - Not now
I remember him
Here it is
Penny's in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her
would go a long way to solving her problems
She sent you to get it from me?
No, no, she's too proud to ask for the money
I, on the other hand, feel you should honor your debt
You do?
"Feel" is a kind of a it's a strong word
I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part
She'll get it when she gets it
Well, there you go Problem solved
A successful quest Now let's go find a gas station with a clean bathroom
No, the problem isn't solved
- He just blew us off - I've got it
He didn't remember me because the last time we met,
I was in a Halloween costume
Come on, Leonard, let's go
You can leave if you want to I'm gonna see this through
I guess, technically, that was my fault
I'm not leaving here without Penny's money
What happened to your backup?
I don't need backup
I have right on my side
And I'm wearing cargo shorts under my pants
Congratulations
You may not have succeed in getting cash,
but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt
Maybe we should have your head notarized
If anybody cares, I still have to pee
- Is Sheldon here? - Hang on
Nice hat
It's kind of a fashionable look these days
Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat
- Hello, Penny - Sheldon, here is your money
Thank you very much It helped a lot
Sarcasm?
Darn I can't seem to get the hang of that
I know it's none of my business, but where did the money come from?
Well, I cut back my expenses like you said
and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant,
but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up
and gives me the money he owes me
Really?
Did he say why?
He said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right
That's it?
Did he give any reason as to why he came
to this moral epiphany?
I just think he's really changed
We're having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret
Bye, guys
Well done, Leonard
The true hero doesn't seek adulation
He fights for right and justice simply because it's his nature
Penny's hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend,
and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
That's your badge of honor your warrior's wound, if you will
I was wrong
Minstrels will write songs about you
Great
There once was a brave lad named Leonard 
With a fi-fi fiddle dee-dee 
He faced a fearsome giant 
While Raj just wanted to pee 
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
That was close
God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning
Yeah, still funny
We can't get to the ridge
The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off
And the creek bed?
The Pharmacology Department controls that,
and they're all hopped up on experimental steroids
That's it then We're doomed
The time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price
for some of us failing to attend
my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting
I told you my mom has spider veins
I had to take her to the laser clinic
And I told you I wanted to see a doctor's note
We need a plan
How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
We hide behind the dumpsters in the parking lot
and ambush people when they come to pee
No go The dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory
That shouldn't be a problem Venus is up during the day
They're probably just all staring at the sky
What we need now is a tactical retreat
Did you see the episode of Stargate 
where they found themselves on a planet
with a culture based loosely on Earth's Athens and Sparta?
Not important
Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away
Howard will cover us
Why don't I run away and you cover me?
Because you chose your mother's veins over victory
On three One, two, three, go!
I had to take her! It's almost bathing suit weather!
I surrender! Don't shoot! They went that way!
Howard, I'm on your team
Leslie, thank God
Where's the rest of your squad?
They left me here to die
What about yours?
- Dead, all of them - Sorry
Don't be
It was friendly fire
They just wouldn't listen
Well, we're surrounded,
so I guess there's nothing for us to do
but wait to be captured or killed
That's the worst part, the waiting
All the while knowing that there's a paint pellet out there
with your name on it
The big wet ball of death
Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn't it?
It kind of does
I say we make every moment count
I agree
How exactly do we do that?
Why aren't you covering us?! We're getting slaughtered out here!
War is hell
Subtitles: The FW Team
Did you guys see the budget nemo that went out this morning?
More cutbacks
Unacceptable It baffles me
why they don't simply let some of you go
so that there's money available for my research
You know what baffles me?
Based on your academic record, any number of things, I imagine
- Hey, guys - Hey
I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted
That's great, Leslie Thanks
You scratch my back, I scratch yours
What was all that about?
No big deal
They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money
Yeah, okay, but what's with the back-scratching and the meow?
I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes
a quid pro quo situation where one party provides
goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action
- Thank you - The meow,
that sounded to me like an African civet cat
Are you done?
Despite what the name suggests,
the civet cat is not a true cat
Now I'm done
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking Howard wasn't making a back-scratching metaphor
I'm thinking there was some actual scratching involved
What about it?
I didn't want to say anything
'cause I know you and Leslie have a little history
I don't care about that
Great, I've been dying to say something
- You and Leslie? - In the paintball shed! Twice!
Is that why you didn't cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
Oh, yeah, sorry about that
My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy
is a court-martial offense
Court-martial, schmort-martial,
Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I've ever had sex with
I mean, for free
Plus, you got a rapid prototyper
That's an expensive piece of equipment
And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone
One way to look at this
is that I'm getting new equipment, and you're not,
and that's unfair
But a better way to look at this is that I'm getting sex
and you're not, and that's delightful
The whole thing froze I don't know what happened
- Calm down We'll figure it out - How can I calm down?
I'm gonna lose my whole shopping cart
That's three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell
- Hello, Penny - Hello, Sheldon
You're in my spot
- Are you planning on sitting here? - No, I'm going to the comic book store
- Then what difference does it make? - What difference does it make?
Here we go
That is my spot
In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency
If my life
were expressed as a function
on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system,
that spot at the moment I first sat on it
would be zero-zero-zero-zero
What?
Don't sit in his spot
Fine
- Happy? - I'm not unhappy
Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle
Okay, that should do it
Thank you You are a lifesaver
That's a lot of shoes you ordered
Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it's really not
Is this one of those paintball guns?
You ought to come out with us sometime
No, thanks I'm from Nebraska
When we shoot things, it's because we want to eat them
or make them leave our boyfriends alone
Boy, your heart's racing I must've really gotten you going
Well, it's partly you,
partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia
Sexy
Can I assume that you've likewise found the experience
Satisfactory?
That wasn't quite the word I was looking for,
but sure, I'll do this pass-fail
Are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?
It's great
Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out
Isn't it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?
You know, most people don't get that
Howard, I'm home! 
- Oh, great - Book club was cancelled! 
That thing on Phyllis's neck opened up again! 
I'm busy, Ma!
Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?! 
- Don't come in, Ma! - Why not? 
He's got company!
There's the arrhythmia
Is she Jewish?! 
Are you Jewish?
- No - Yes!
Okay, then you kids have fun! 
Use protection! 
You think he'll notice?
There's a chance
What are we gonna do?
"We"?
No, you had your chance to be "we"
for, like, a year and a half now
Right now, you are "you," and you are screwed
- Why do we have to tell him I did it? - We're not gonna tell him I did it
Okay, okay, how about this?
We tell him somebody broke in
Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
I'm sorry, I buy it All those people are on drugs
We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend
Okay, fine What if we just flip it over?
There Looks fine, right?
Butt print
There's no discernible butt print
Oh, come on
There, butt print
It's too small and too
perfect
- Thank you - You're welcome
Act normal
- How was the comic book store? - Fine The new issue of Flash is out
Great, great
Did you walk the whole way? It's a little chilly
- Koothrappali picked me up - Isn't that terrific?
He is such a good friend
You know what the best thing about friends is?
They don't talk incessantly for no particular reason
No, friends forgive the little things
- I gotta go home and wash my hair - Don't you dare, missy
Hello, fastest man alive
Want to see me read your entire comic book?
Want to see it again?
Something's wrong
- What do you mean? - I'm not sure
It doesn't feel right
I don't know what you're talking about
Oh, that Penny did that
Excuse me
Why don't you just eat in your desk chair?
Why don't I just eat in my desk chair?
Here we go
That is my desk chair That is where I work
I don't eat in my desk chair
and I don't work in my spot
I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot
Wackadoodle
You know, there's kind of an obvious solution here
Get up
There Problem solved
Nobody cares where you're going to sit You're not crazy
Excuse me, but the problem is not solved
If your head had been accidentally amputated,
and we transplanted a dog's head in its place,
would that be "problem solved"?
If it were your head, it would be
I am really, really sorry, but it's only for a week
Can't you be a little bit flexible?
Yeah, sorry I didn't really think that through
You claimed it's going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner
Why not?
Did you notice the sign on his counter?
He's not a full-time dry cleaner
He also makes keys
For God's sake, Sheldon
Focus is important
Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants?
Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser?
"Thanks for discovering penicillin Now how about we try a bouffant?"
Looks like I'm gonna have sex tonight
Hey, baby
His right hand is calling him?
No, it's Leslie Winkle It's a long story
I'll pick you up in ten minutes
Gentlemen, adieu 
I thought we were going to play Halo tonight
What am I supposed to do?
There's a woman out there anxious to have sex with me
You understand, right?
No Not at all
Nevertheless, I must depart By the way, did I tell you?
Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip
to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider
That's not fair You're not even a physicist
There are two ways of looking at this
- Get out - Bye
You're improving
Thank you
It helps when I get to practice with a real woman
Listen
Saturday my sister's getting married I want you to come with me
It's black tie
Yeah, gee
I'd really rather not
Why not?
When I go to weddings, it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids
I don't know what I would do with a date
All right I understand
Thanks
I'm really sorry about that Geneva trip
- What about it? - Didn't you hear?
I reduced the number of people going, and you didn't make the cut
When did that happen?
About 12 seconds ago
Well, hold on Are you saying
if I don't go to the wedding, I can't go to Geneva?
Actually, I'm trying not to say it
Okay, I'm sorry,
but that makes me a little uncomfortable
- How so? - 'Cause it's like you're controlling me
with new equipment and research trips
If I weren't controlling you with new equipment and research trips,
- then I'd be uncomfortable - How so?
'Cause we'd be in a real relationship with feelings and all that crap
So, bottom line, I'm just a
bought-and-paid-for sex toy
No, not at all
You're also arm candy
So?
What do you think?
Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!
Right now? 
What kind of sex are you having up there? 
Why are you crouching there?
This is my spot
Where else am I supposed to crouch?
I don't know Texas?
Here you go Fresh from the cleaners, good as new
Really? Great Sheldon, look Good as new
From that key maker, I highly doubt it
Come on, Sheldon Just give it a try
All right
There, nice and comfy cozy Zero, zero, zero
There's one more zero
You forgot the time parameter
Sit on the damn couch
What do you mean, "nope"? What's wrong with it?
Nothing, it's what's wrong with him
It's exactly the same
Penny, I think I know what to do
Sheldon, I have some bad news
More?
I'm afraid so
You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
Yes From Szechuan Palace
Szechuan Palace closed two years ago
What?
Where did my cashew chicken come from?
Golden Dragon
No, this isn't right
Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers
Yeah, well, before they went out of business,
I bought 4,000 containers
I keep them in the trunk of my car
But
This changes everything
I thought that might take his mind off the cushion
What's real? What isn't? How can I know?
- You did make that up, right? - Oh, God, I wish I had
- Leonard? - Yeah, buddy?
I still don't like this cushion
Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming
Thanks for the shoes
Penny is an amazing shot We have a real chance to win this week
- What's the plan? - Now, we all run out
Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees
Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks
We'll have a great view
as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight
- Just one thing before we start - What is it, Sheldon?
What the hell?!
That was for my cushion
Sheldon, Penny was our only hope
I'm sorry
But revenge is a dish best served cold
Screw that
She can't shoot me She's dead
He's right You can't
Well, if we're going to descend into anarchy
See you
- Where are you going? - Surrender, then Denny's
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Okay, Raj
Hand me the #6 Torx screwdriver
Stop
We can't do this It's not right
You have two choices Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo,
or you delete stuff before we go out of town
But once you open the box, you've voided the warranty
The warranty
is a sacred covenant we've entered into with the manufacturer
He offers to stand by his equipment,
and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware
This little orange sticker
is all that stands between us and anarchy
Then we won't touch the hard drive
We'll just erase the first season of Battlestar 
There We're outlaws
Is this going to be big enough?
It's perfect
For taking daffodils to your unicorn
It's just for my notebooks Thanks, Penny
I love San Francisco I wish I was going with you
I understand your envy This is a can't-miss symposium
There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices,
the advancements in multi-threaded task completion,
plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green's function approach
to the photoionization process in atoms
When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars
This conference is kind of a big thing
The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot
Oh, my God, the George Smoot ?
- You've heard of him? - Of course I haven't
George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist,
one of the great minds of our time
His work in black body form and anisotropy
of the cosmic microwave background radiation
cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe
It's kind of a funny name, though "Smoot"
It's like talking to a chimp
Now that I've been completely insulted, have a good flight
I wish
We're not flying We're taking the train
- Oh, cool - Yeah, cool
Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much
- Then why are you doing it? - We had a vote
Three of us voted for airplane Sheldon voted for train
So we're taking the train
Don't say it like that Say it like:
"We're taking the train!"
Subtitles: The FW Team
We're all going over to the Apple store
to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar You want to come?
I always enjoy that, but I'm a little busy
What are you doing?
I'm simplifying the task of packing for our trip
See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing,
it will enable my laptop
to read and identify the items with this wand
I will then cross-reference them against destination,
anticipated activity spectrum,
weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera
That does sound much simpler
How long is this going to take?
Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes
Plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation
Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now
- I don't follow - I wouldn't expect you to See you

Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight,
one of the great American trains
operating on one of the classic American routes
On this side, you'll see panoramic ocean vistas
inaccessible to any other form of transportation,
while on your side, you'll be treated to 350 miles
of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes,
and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools
- Come on, Raj - What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?
- Why not? - That's over the wheelbase
Are you completely unfamiliar
with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980
Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?
We've been on this train 90 seconds,
and you've already said a thousand words
Just tell us where to sit and shut up
Here
I'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards
of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails,
- your sour disposition will abate - Yeah, maybe
Meanwhile, back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables

Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's protecting him from an evil Terminator
Unlikely That's a television show

Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future,
a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind
would be to send Terminators back posing as actors
who have played Terminators in popular films and television series,
lulling us into a false sense of security,
ie, "That's Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles 
"No, Summer, don't kill me! I'm pro-robot!"
At least he's off the train crap
I owe you an apology Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance!
I've actually got a shot at a Terminator
Please When it comes to Terminators,
you've got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger
You're overlooking something
I have 11 hours with her in a confined space
Unless she's willing to jump off a moving train,
tuck and roll down the side of a hill,
she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste
that is Howard Wolowitz
My money's on tuck and roll
I'm confused I thought you were involved
in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle
- Let me explain to you how this works - All right
That's Summer Glau
That's it
Hang on a sec Why do you get first crack at her?
Let's see, couple reasons
- One, I saw her first - No, you didn't I did
Fair enough But then, let me move on to #2
Unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I'm sober
You fail to take into account that even mute,
I am foreign and exotic,
while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty
You know the old saying,
"Pasty and frail never fail"
Excuse me, but what about me? Why don't I get a shot?
Fine, go ahead
Take a shot
I've already got a gorgeous blonde back home that I can't score with
I think I'll let you two take this one
Is there a place on this train to get alcohol?
Interesting that you ask
The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car
Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car,
the lower level is a theater and the upper level is a bar that offers
wine tastings if you're going as far as Portland
- So aren't you going to go talk to her? - I will, I'm just
working on my opening line
She's probably heard every possible line
Why don't you just try "hello"?
No, no, that always creeps girls out
I need to come up with something that's funny,
smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment
is disproportionate to my physical stature
You're going to need more than 11 hours
- Oh, no - What's the matter?
- I forgot my flash drive - So?
So we have to go back
Okay, I'm going to say "why"
and your answer cannot be "because I forgot my flash drive"
You don't understand
My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes
of M-theory effects in the early universe
that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference
Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
It's brilliant He needs to read it
So you'll send him an e-mail when we get back
Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it
- Right Of course - This is an unmitigated disaster
There's nothing you can do about it, so relax
Sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack
of the steel wheels on the polished rails
You forgot your flash drive, you forgot your flash drive
Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go
It's hot in here Must be Summer
So where you gals headed?
Okay, I've found the perfect solution
We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard
We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station
We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive,
and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us
and minimal traffic, we'll meet the train
- I've got a better idea - Are you going to be sarcastic?
You take all the fun out of it for me
Penny's home Why don't we call her, have her go in the apartment,
get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?
But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk
- So? - The key is hidden in my room
- So? - Penny would have to go into my room
- So? - People don't go in my room!
I see It seems once again,
you're caught between a rock and a crazy place
I hate when that happens
It's hot in here Must be Summer
It's hot in here Must be Summer
It's hot in here Must be Summer
- That's cute - Really? I just made it up
Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire ?
Yeah, I loved it
It's loosely based on my life
We're putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theater
Can you come?
Oh, great
Do you know 98 other people that might want to come?
Hang on
Listen carefully I'm about to give you
a set of instructions which you must follow to the letter
Just a sec
The theater is above a bowling alley, so it's a little noisy,
but it might be the only chance I'll ever get to play Anne Frank
And the director is brilliant
He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery
Great, I'll see you then
- Hello? - Okay, step four 
Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?
Your dresser? Who is this?
- It's Sheldon - Hey, Sheldon! 
- How is San Francisco? - I'm not in San Francisco
I'm on a train Were you even listening to me?
I was talking to my friend, but what's up?
What's up? I'll tell you what's up
I'm in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal
your powers of concentration, limited as they may be
Give me the phone
- Hi, Penny It's Leonard - Hey, Leonard 
What's going on with Dr Wackadoodle?
He's calling to ask you a favor
You might be confused because he didn't use the words,
"Penny," "Sheldon," "please" or "favor"
Enough chitchat Okay, step one
Locate your emergency key to our apartment
Step two: 
enter our apartment Step three:
Enter my bedroom
- Step four: - Hang on, getting another call
Let me tell you
Personal robots cannot get here soon enough
And that bright little star
peeking her head out early today
that's Venus
That is so cool
- You really know a lot about space - Come on
When you were on TV in Firefly ,
you were actually in space
You're not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?
You mean one of the hopeless geeks?
Those are crazy people
Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these
Now, him, he's one of those geeks
All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted,
I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access
does not create a permanent easement
Easement
It's a legal right of access Good grief
What? No, don't put me on hold
Do you believe him?
Normally around women, he has the personality
of a boiled potato
Put one beer in him, and he's M Night Charmalarmalon
Is that what he's drinking? It's not even real beer
- What? - Look
"Non-alcoholic beer"
- What's going on? - I don't know
Some sort of placebo effect, I guess
Placebo, you say
Interesting
Yes, I'm still here Where am I going? I'm on a train
Now, what you'll be looking for
is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman's sphere
and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite
Hoberman's Sphere
It's a collapsible icosidodecahedron
No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock
Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different
Where you have the Big Dipper,
we have the Big Curry Pot
You're making that up
You got me
Now what are you going to do with me?
Look
- What am I looking at? - You tell me
"Non-alcoholic beer"
Hi I'm the small package good things come in
I got a box,
but there's no key in here Just letters
That's the wrong box Put it back
Are these letters from your grandmother?
Don't read those letters!
Look, she calls you "Moon Pie" That is so cute
Put down the letters!
Hey, Penny It's Leonard
- How's the train ride? - Delightful
I don't know what you're doing
but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon's mouth
Yeah, I kind of crossed a line Put him back on
Thank you
- I'm back - What up, Moon Pie?
No one calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!
Hey, Penny Leonard again
In the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us
And then, I picked you up by your ankles
and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off
I tried to stick them back on,
but before I could,
you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread
What do you think that means?
I really don't know
I'll give you a clue
My favorite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel
Is that so?
Did you know "pumpernickel"
comes from the German words "pumper" and "nickel,"
which loosely translates to "fart goblin"?
I didn't
Okay, I found the box Now what?
You're holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes
ten precise moves to open
First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern 
and slide the center portion one millimeter to the left
Then, on the opposite end of the box, 
slide the entire panel down two millimeters
You'll hear a slight click
Hang on
Do you have any emotional attachment to this box?
No, it's a novelty I ordered off the Internet
Did you hear the click?
Not yet
There it is
Okay, here's another one
If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter,
you'd be Summer Winter
I'm going to just go for broke here and say I like you
So here's my question:
do you realistically see any conversational path
that would take us from where we are right now
to a place where I could ask you out and you'd say yes?
Fair enough I'll leave you in peace
Thank you
But before I go,
would you mind
if I take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?
Sure
Great Now, can I take one where it looks like we're making out?
Now you're going to insert the flash drive
into the USB port
She calls me Moon Pie
because I'm nummy-nummy
and she could just eat me up
Now, please put the flash drive in the USB port
The one that looks like a little duck's mouth
How'd it go?
Terminator broke my phone
Excuse me
I'll be honest with you
I've just spent the last two hours imaging various scenarios in my head,
trying to come up with some clever line to say to you
But I finally realized you're a human being;
I'm a human being
- I could just say - Next stop: Santa Barbara 
I'm sorry This is me
Hi, my name's Leonard
So, I'm thinking, you won
the Nobel Prize what, three years ago?
So you must deal with a whole lot of "What has Smoot done lately?"
My thought is we continue my research as a team
you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical
and when we win the Nobel Prize, you'll be back on top
With all due respect, Dr Cooper, are you on crack?
Fine! Smoot-Cooper
What a diva
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Okay, it's done Look, guys,
for the future, I don't mind killing the big spiders,
but you have to at least try with the little ones
Please We're facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids
It's not so bad
Not bad? It's horrible
You hear stories about this things, but you never think it'll happen to you
So they steamed your dumplings Get over it
- New topic, please - All right, Penny
Let me take this opportunity to point out
that you are looking particularly ravishing today
Not with a thousand condoms, Howard
So, there is a number
Okay, new topic, please
Did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?
What?!
- The people upstairs are moving out - No!
The horror
Why would you just say something like that?
- How else was I supposed to say it? - Slowly
Like putting a new fish in a tank You don't just drop it in
You let the bag sit in the water a while
The horror
- I'm sure it's going to be fine - No, it's not going to be fine
Change is never fine They say it is, but it's not
Honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?
I never met them
That's what made them perfect
There were no awkward "hellos" in the halls
There's no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors
They may as well have been a family of cats
just jumping around from drape to drape
Without that annoying ammonia urine smell
I'm sure the new people will be just as quiet
You can't know that How can you possibly know that?
You're right, I can't You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now:
an opera singer, the cast of Stomp 
Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg
Why are you making it worse?
I tried making it better He wouldn't go for it
You're right! That's a great idea
- What? - I'll take the apartment upstairs
I can finally get away from my mother
and we can all spend some more time together
If you catch my drift
The horror
Subtitles: The FWT Team
Hold on You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol
dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move,
and then he only need buy us a pizza?
I'm sorry, that really is how it works
You're tricking me
You tell me the truth, what do we get?
Help me out here
You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3
I knew it!
PS3, definitely PS3
Who would pick a mountain bike?
Enough with the guilt, Ma
We'll still see each other
I'll come over every night and have dinner with you
The hell you will!
What am I running here, a fancy restaurant?
Does this look like Olive Garden?!
Okay, I get it, you're angry
You don't want to see your little bird leave the nest
"Little bird"?
You're almost 30!
Fly, for God's sake!
Fine, I'll stay!
Ya happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so,
because you're ruining my life!
Hey, Penny? Good news, you can take your head out of the oven
I guess I won't be needing this
The new ones
They're here
Stay calm We don't know anything about them yet
- What are you doing? - I'm checking for musical instruments
Does that sound like castanets to you?
The box says "kitchen"
So? Do cocaine smugglers write "cocaine" on the box?
Hello?
- Hello - Hello
I'm Alicia I'm moving in upstairs
That is so great
Oh, I'm Leonard I live downstairs
Upstairs from here, but under you
Not under you per se, but
under your apartment
- That's nice - Yeah, it is
If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate
On a scale of one to ten, how light of foot
would you describe yourself, with one being not cat-like at all,
and ten being freakishly feline?
"Freakishly feline"?
Is that your answer or do you not understand the question?
We'll come back to that one
Hang on Are you now or have you ever been
a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?
- You're making her uncomfortable - Oh, I'm sorry
If it helps you feel any better, you're doing very well so far
Next question: are you fertile?
What?!
I'm trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility
- I have no immediate plans - If that changes, let me know
And finally, area rugs, pro or con?
- Pro? - Alicia?
- Yes? - Welcome to the building
Thanks so much for helping me
Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help
Hey, guys
This is Alicia, our new neighbor
- Hi - Hi
I'm helping
I can see
Alicia's non-musical, childless and pro-rug
She's still on probation, of course, but I like her
Cool T-shirt
Oh, I don't usually dress like this I'm going jogging
- You don't jog - I can start
True, but the more likely explanation is that you're out of clean clothes again
- Thank you, Sheldon - You're welcome, Penny
Please, you look cute I'm dressed like a slob today, too
I think you look fantastic
This one's a player, huh?
Yeah, be careful
Thanks for the warning
- I'll see you around - See ya
I'm dressed like a slob today, too
Oh, mimicry
I enjoy mimicry
I've been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi 
"It's a trap"
You have to imagine me with a giant squid head
"It's a trap"
Come
Congratulations, I see you did your laundry
- Sort of - How does one "sort of"
I bought new clothes, okay?
- Is Leonard around? - He's upstairs at Alicia's
Oh All right, that's cool, no biggie
He said he'd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait
What exactly is he doing up there?
In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me,
he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo
Oh, they're all up there? Typical
It's axiomatically atypical
Up until recently, they did not know her,
and had no encounters with her in a previous location
They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants
Your characterization of their behavior as "typical" is demonstrably fallacious
Now I see the giant squid head
Oh, great! Now, I have to start all over again
Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment,
but I'm really more of a "downtown loft" kind of guy
Cool So are you in a loft now?
Oh, actually, I'm, living with a woman in Altadena
Purely platonic She's also my maid
- Sounds like a sweet deal - I won't lie It's pretty dope
I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift
That is so sweet
- Come on in Let's open it - Great
Nice dress
This? I'm dressed like a slob today
The guys have been helping me set up my sound system
I've never had such good-looking technical support
Pish-posh
I don't know, it means shucks
"Shucks" means shucks Let one go once in a while
You want to hear something awesome?
Alicia is an actress, just like you
That is so awesome
Well, trying to be, but it's so hard
- I know, tell me about it - I've been out here 3 months,
and all I've gotten is a couple of national commercials
and this recurring thing on a soap
That's why I work at the Cheesecake Factory
I'm holding out for the right part
What do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 51 Dolby or DTS?
Whatever you think is best, cutie
Well, DTS has more low end, so
Hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this
I read the best science joke
You won't get it, but it's right up their alley
Anyway,
this physicist goes into an ice cream parlor every week
and orders an ice cream sundae for himself,
and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him
This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he's doing
The man says, "Well, I'm a physicist,
"and quantum mechanics teaches us
"that it is possible for the matter above this stool
"to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman
"who might accept my offer and fall in love with me"
The owner then says, "Lots of single, beautiful women come in here ever day
"Buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you"
And the physicist says,
"Yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?"
It's a little insulting, don't you think?
How would I know? I'm not even sure I get it
Leonard?
If you're done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?
Yeah, I'd love to
Maybe when you're done with her printer, you could set up mine
You know, like you promised a week ago
Yeah, I'll get to it Don't nag me
Hello there
Who is it?
Hello, Penny It's open Come in
Sarcasm
- Well, they're all still up there - You think I can't hear them?
Listen to that: stomp, stomp, stomp
That's Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one
I don't even know why I care I don't care
Enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that's all I care
You know, Penny,
there's something that occurs in beehives
you might find interesting
Occasionally,
a new queen will arrive
while the old queen is still in power
When this happens,
the old queen must either locate to a new hive
or engage in a battle to the death
until only one queen remains
What are you saying, that I'm threatened by Alicia?
I'm like the old queen of the hive and it's just time for me to go?
I'm just talking about bees
They're on The Discovery Channel
What are you talking about?
Bees
I just got that physicist joke
Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner
- Yeah, what's the occasion? - No occasion
Just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps
Did you remember to ask for the chicken to be diced, not shredded?
Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
Brown rice, not white?
Did you stop at the grocery for the good hot mustard?
And pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
Good
See how it's done?
What do we got going on tonight?
Playing Halo, watching Battlestar , drop some Mentos in Diet Coke?
- You want to watch Battlestar ? - What can I say?
I got my geek on, boys
No, PMS is different
- Thank God you're home I need help - What's wrong?
I got a callback to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed
I'd watch that
But my car is in the shop,
and I have to be at Universal in 45 minutes
I'll take you
You're a lifesaver
- I'll run lines with you in the car - Great
And afterward, I'll take you all out for Chinese
Actually, we already have
Starving
 Chinese food right here
They're gone, Penny They can't hear you
I cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that
Anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs
You know last week, she had Howard drive all the way
to her uncle's house in Orange County to pick up her TV?
You once had Leonard and me get your television
from your ex-boyfriend
Apples and oranges here, Sheldon
I'm telling you, that girl is a user, skating through life on her looks,
taking advantage of weak-willed men,
getting auditions for stupid network shows
It just creams my corn
- May I interject something here? - Please
You got the wrong mustard
Guess what?
I got the part on CSI 
Oh, boy
Something wrong?
No, you know, congratulations I think you'll make a great hooker
Thank you
I got to ask you something
How much do physicists make?
I don't know I don't think a lot
Yeah, that's what I figured
Well, got to run
The guys promised to set up my satellite dish
and paint my bedroom
Can I talk to you about that for a second?
About what?
You know, it's just that Leonard and Howard and Raj,
they aren't like other guys
They're special
Okay, they're special and?
Let's see How can I explain this?
They don't know how to use their shields
- Shields? - Yeah, like in Star Trek ,
when you're in battle and you raise the shields?
Where the hell'd that come from?
Anyways, you know how guys like this are, so
please don't take advantage of them
Who says I'm taking advantage of them?
Come on They're doing everything for you,
because you're leading them on
So I let them do stuff for me
They're happy I get stuff
Who cares?
And how's it any different from what you do?
Excuse me?
I've seen you around them
Are you pretending like you don't do the exact same thing?
Okay, lady,
you are way out of line
I'm out of line?
Yeah, you're out of line
What are you going to do about it,
bitch?
I like Green Lantern
I'm just saying it's pretty lame that he can be defeated
by the color yellow
Only the modern Green Lantern is vulnerable to yellow
Golden age Green Lantern was vulnerable to wood
Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?
Oh, my God! Girl fight!
- What are you doing? - I know you
You're stupid enough to break it up
May I say you look very comely tonight?
Thank you
You're right, this filly's been broken
You set it on DTS, didn't you?
I had to
She called me "cutie"
According to Alicia's Facebook page,
she's hooking up with one of the producers on CSI 
Dead whore on TV, live one in real life
Great
Now she's jumping up and down on the bed
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Are you from the Star Wars universe?
- Were you in the original trilogy? - Yes
Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
God, I hope not
And no, I'm not Princess Leia
Okay My turn
Are you in all six Star Wars movies?
- Yes - Interesting
Are you a droid?
Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?
- C-3PO - You got it
That's preposterous
I do not resemble C-3PO
Don't get me wrong I'm flattered I just don't see it
Leslie Winkle
You've reached "Friends with Benefits"
For a booty call, press one now
What exactly does that expression mean,
"friends with benefits"?
Does he provide her with health insurance?
Imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with,
but you were free to date whoever you wanted
I'm sorry I can't imagine any of that
- All right Back to the game - I believe it's my turn
You may begin your questions whenever you're ready
Are you Spock?
I don't like this game
So, where were we?
Aren't you leaving for your booty call?
No, it was something else
Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on
Whose turn is it?
- We were up to you - Great Just start
Let's see Are you from a TV series?
She dumped me!
I bet he's someone from Babylon 5  We're never going to get it
Subtitles: The FWT Team
What happened? Why did she dump you?
I don't know She just said, "Howard, Mama's a rolling stone"
Then her call waiting beeped and she was gone
I don't understand
If you were in a non-emotional relationship,
then why are you having what appears to be an emotional response?
He obviously had feelings for her
Of course I had feelings for her I saw her naked, for God's sake
Okay, you just need to get your mind off it
Do you want to go to the comic book store?
- Maybe go see a movie? - I don't want to go anywhere
You know,
I'm given to understand that there's an entire city in Nevada
designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems
They can replace them with new problems,
such as alcoholism, gambling addiction, and sexually transmitted diseases
Is it me, or was that Sheldon's way of saying, "Vegas, baby!"?
- I've never been there Have you? - Me? No
I just got "Vegas, baby!" from Vince Vaughn in Swingers 
It could be fun My weekend's wide open, now that
Okay, let's do this Let's go to Las Vegas
Now? Right now?
Why not? People do things "right now," all the time
Why can't we be "right now" people, too?
Go home, pack a bag, and we'll be "right now" people
I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription,
but after that, we'll go right now
What do you say, Howard?
I say
"Vegas, baby!"
- What are you gonna tell your mother? - "Sea World, baby!"
- Are you coming? - I'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs
and hatch larvae in my auditory canal
Great We'll bring you back a t-shirt
Thank you
Hello, neighbor
Hello, Sheldon
And how are you this fine evening?
- Great - Good I'm glad
Really? Are you drunk?
I'm just in a good mood
While my compatriots are in Las Vegas,
I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude
That's Superman's big ice thingy, right?
You know, I'm in such a good mood,
I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language
folksy and charming today
What smells so good?
That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer,
a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds
Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes,
it contains a generous helping of peanuts,
which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97-pound blister
And finally, its main ingredient is paneer,
a farmer's cheese
that would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes
Yum
Well, enjoy your big evening
I realize you're also on your own tonight,
so if, at some point, you find yourself with nothing to do,
please do not disturb me
Have fun, Sheldon
I shall
What's wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?
Look at this Mouthwash, lotion, body wash
Shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle
I love Las Vegas
Howard, could I borrow some aftershave?
Black case, top compartment
That's a lot of cologne
First row are your musks Second is woods,
leathers and botanicals
Third is assorted pheromones Tread lightly
That's the spirit, Howard
Yes, we can
Let's go
You guys go ahead I just have to finish up an email
That's not an email That's Leslie's Facebook page
Okay, fine
I'm checking her Facebook page Look at her status update
She's saying she dumped me People need to know I dumped her
But she did dump you
Grow up, Raj There's no place for truth on the Internet
Just go I'll catch up with you
All right
We should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky
Okay, if I get lucky,
I'll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and
if you get lucky, I'll sleep on the moon
Sounds like a plan
Hang on I think the emergency key is around here somewhere
We have a bowl
Our keys go in a bowl
You should get a bowl
So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper
forget his key in the first place?
I left them in the bowl
I just remembered where the emergency key is
Where? In your apartment
- What's it doing in my apartment? - I went in there a few weeks ago
and you guys weren't home and I forgot it there
You went in my Why would What are you saying?
It's not a big deal I was making coffee and I ran out of milk
You're the milk thief!
Leonard said I was crazy, but I knew that carton felt lighter
All right Just calm down
I will call the building manager and he'll come open your door
Eat your dinner here while you're waiting
Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?
Why not?
Sure Why not?
And after the sun's down, we can all pile in my pickup
and go skinny-dipping down at the creek
'Cause today's the day to stop making sense
Thanks
I'm telling you, Leonard video slots
free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid
and all you can eat shrimp for $395
Disneyland can suck it
This is the real happiest place on earth
Dude, check it out! That's laundry for a month!
Hi
Hello
- What's your name? - Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali
Hello, Rajesh Ra
Hi, Rajesh
- I'm Michaela - Hello, Michaela
So, you interested in a little party?
Why, yes, I love to party
Party is my middle name
Or, it would be if it weren't Ramayan
- Can I talk to you for a moment? - Not now
Michaela's inviting me to a party
You better call the moon and make sure they have a bed for you
Yeah I really need to talk to you
Excuse me I'll be right back Don't go anywhere Don't move
Just stay the beautiful, unspoiled American flower that you are
What's wrong with you, dude? That woman was all up in my jammy
Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your "jammy" is, but
I'm pretty sure she's a prostitute
What?
Let me put it this way: In your entire life,
how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar
and asked if you wanted to party?
Maybe I can save her
Maybe, but I'm guessing it'll cost you about $500 an hour to try
It was lovely meeting you Best of luck in your future endeavors
Whatever
I miss her already
Howard's losing it
Check out his latest Twitters
"I'm at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss
"My life is meaningless My future is without hope"
Why don't we take him to see the Blue Man Group?
You think that'd help?
USA Today calls them "exuberant fun for the whole family"
I don't know, Howard isn't really the family fun kind of guy
It's too bad he wasn't here for that hooker
She's exactly his type; a hooker
You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up
We're not gonna get Wolowitz a hooker
"I'm so lonely and horny,
"I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all"
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to get an estimate
So how was your day?
Are you trying to make small talk?
Sweetie, you really don't have to
No, it's the accepted convention
How was your day?
They shifted my schedule around at the restaurant,
- so my hours are gonna be - I'm sorry
That's not going to interest me at all Just eat
Hello again
Hi Listen
If you're not busy, we were thinking maybe you could
- We were wondering - If you're really a prostitute
- You guys cops? - No
I'm a prostitute
Okay, great
The thing is, we've got this friend, and he's kind of down in the dumps
And we thought maybe you could cheer him up
With sex
I think she knows what I meant
How when you beat around the bush? She's from the mean streets
where they shoot from the hip and keep it real
Don't worry I can take good care of your friend
Okay, terrific
Listen, is there a way that we can do this
where he doesn't know that you're a, you know
Prostitute
You want the girlfriend experience
Yes Yeah, exactly The girlfriend experience
Actually, if it's not too much to ask,
could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience?
Okay, that's question 20 You have to guess
I don't know, Sheldon
Are you Star Wars ?
How can one person be a whole movie?
I give up Can we just do something else?
Fine
I was Spock
Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
What?
Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
Where did that even come from? Did he say we were?
No, Leonard said nothing But who knows what goes on over here
when he pretends your mail was misdelivered?
Just mail, no benefits
I see
Why are you asking?
I'm curious about the whole social construct
On its face, the idea of satisfying one's sexual appetite,
assuming one is afflicted with such,
without emotional entanglement,
that seems eminently practical
What I've observed, however,
is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl
Some people just can't handle that kind of relationship
Can you?
Excuse me?
Are you able to have sex with men
without developing an emotional attachment?
I really don't want to talk about this with you
Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
Of course it's making me uncomfortable Can't you tell?
I really have no idea
I don't particularly excel at reading facial expressions
I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!
Thank you That's very helpful
All right, where are these amazing shrimp?
Behold
Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby's arm?
A little baby
I'm going back to the room
Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?
Hi, there Howard Wolowitz
Esther Rosenblatt
I don't think the manager's coming tonight, so here
Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch?
It wasn't the first suggestion that came to mind,
but it's the one I'm going with
I can't sleep on your couch I sleep in a bed
And given its dimensions, I have no intention of living out Snickering's
beloved children's book, The Tall Man From Cornwall 
What?
"There was a tall man from Cornwall
"whose length exceed his bed
"My body fits on it, but barely upon it,
"there's no room for my big Cornish head"
All right, I will give you my bed on one condition:
that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours
May I say one last thing?
Only if it doesn't rhyme
All right
Good night
Turn-ons? Let me see
Reading a good book in front of the fire,
long walks on the beach
and getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger
Really? Me, too!
Oy, gevalt , you're hot
Excuse me for a moment
How's it going?
Cut the crap You set this up, didn't you?
She's a hooker, isn't she?
A prostitute, yes
You already gave her the money?
Thank you!
What?
I can't sleep
Maybe that's because your hole is still open
I'm homesick
Your home is 20 feet from here
20 feet, 20 light-years, it doesn't matter
It's in a galaxy far, far away
Damn it
What do you want me to do?
Sing Soft Kitty 
That's only for when you're sick
Homesick is a type of being sick
Come on, do I really have to?
I suppose we can stay up and talk
Soft kitty 
Warm kitty 
Little ball of fur 
Happy kitty 
- Sleepy kitty - Sleepy kit 
Start over
Soft kitty 
Warm kitty 
Little ball of fur 
Happy kitty 
Sleepy kitty 
Purr, purr, purr 
Thank you for letting me stay here
You're welcome, sweetie
Okay, I'm sleepy now Get out
Good You're finally home
What were you doing at Penny's?
Well, we had dinner,
played some games, and then I spent the night
You'll be happy to know that I now have
a much better understanding of "friends with benefits"
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Smell that?
That's the smell of new comic books
They're on me today, boys
You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?
No, I'm celebrating
As we speak, the space shuttle is docking
at the International Space Station
where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System
Get over yourself It's a high-tech toilet
Just think Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts
will "boldly go where no man has gone before"
- Is that supposed to be funny? - I believe it is
The combination of the Star Trek reference
and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb "to go"
suggests that Leonard is mocking your efforts in space plumbing
Okay, make your little jokes,
but of the four of us, I'm the only one making
any real-world contribution to science and technology
He's right This is an important achievement, for two reasons
Number one
and, of course, number two!
Clever!
Playing on the use of cardinal numbers
as euphemisms for bodily functions
Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you
It's mind-blowing
Excuse me
Spoiler alert
I didn't spoil anything
You told me it's mind-blowing
So, my mind is going into it pre-blown
And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown
I'm sorry
Said the Grinch to Christmas
- Can I talk to you about something? - What's up?
Remember I went out with Penny, a couple weeks ago?
- Yeah, vaguely - Sure you remember
You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself
trying to pick up strange women
What about it?
The thing is, the date didn't go that well
Too bad
I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up,
dust yourself off, forget it and move on
- I can't do that - Why the hell not?
'Cause we're going out again tomorrow
Excuse me, Stuart
Have you read the new Flash?
Well, I have and it will knock your socks off!
Good luck getting them back on
This is probably my last shot with Penny and I don't want to screw it up
Nobody wants that
So, here's my question: It's the second date,
you think she'll be expecting things
to get physical?
Gee
My initial reaction is "no,"
but let me think about it and get back to you
So, you'll give me a call?
- Yeah, or you call me - Great
Or nobody calls anyone
Interesting
Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor
You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj
Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny
without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
I'm listening
Just tell him to do everything you've done with her
for the last two years
Subtitles: The FW Team
- How's it going? - Good, good You?
Fine
Can I ask you something?
Sure
You know your friend Stuart?
He asked me out again and I said yes,
and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first
About what?
Does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends?
'Cause you know, you and me
No, that's the past
I'm really more of a "right now" kind of guy
You know, living in the moment
Although I do have to live a little in the future, 'cause that's my job
Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction
does draw my attention backwards,
but those stories often take place in the future
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me
Okay, well, that's really cool of you
I wouldn't say cool I'd just say "That's Leonard!"
In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
About Stuart?
Love to
He's very shy
How do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
First of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort
Really?
Stuart thrives under pressure
That's why he works in a comic book store
It's Stuart
You're not going to answer it?
He wants to talk about Penny I don't want to talk about Penny
You're making an assumption
Perhaps the comic book store is on fire
And he needs your assistance
Why would he call me?
We don't know
And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know
I'm not answering the phone
Answer the phone, Leonard
There, it went to voice mail
Aren't you going to check your messages?
You have to check your messages!
The living of a message is one half of a social contract
which is completed by the checking of the message
If that contract breaks down,
then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy
It must be hell inside your head
At times
Guys, we have a code red
"Code Red" the hospital emergency alert, the computer worm,
or the cherry-flavored soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet,
and I made a teeny tiny mistake
on the specifications for the diverter valve
How teeny tiny?
It's gonna fail after about ten flushes
- But the mission is for six months - See, that's the code red
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box
No one knows exactly when, but at some point
something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box
Have you notified NASA?
Are you crazy? What am I gonna say?
"I screwed up your toilet and there's gonna be crap floating
"all over your nice shiny space station"?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them
So, what do you need us for?
He can't figure out how to fix it
You said you were gonna be supportive
I'm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny
I agree
It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration
against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet
that provides the comic fodder here
Check your messages
All right, this is an exact duplicate
of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System
as deployed on the International Space Station
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
Good one
It's hilarious Now
Here's an approximation
of the spare parts available on the Space Station
We gotta find a way, using nothing but this,
to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine
You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?
I have to say,
I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition
Apparently, there is no law
of diminishing comedic returns with space poop
You busy?
Classified, Leonard
Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project
What's up?
Tonight's my date with Penny
and since we haven't been able to connect by phone
I'm sorry, it's been broken
- Or e-mail - Yeah, that too Everything's broken
Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice
All right, well, off the top of my head,
I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow
I mean, glacial
Guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to set yourself apart
Be a little shy,
don't make too much eye contact
And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment
and-and, you know, fear
- Fear? - Yeah, like,
you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break
Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse
Good, good You kids have fun tonight
Thanks, Leonard
What is that thing anyway?
You don't know what this is?
Good Get out
Be afraid of Penny
Nice Very crafty
It wasn't bad advice It's just wasn't particularly helpful
For what it's worth, my mother says
that when we deceive for personal gain,
we make Jesus cry
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC
- to reinforce the center cross-support? - No good
It might work for the Japanese and the Americans,
but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there?
This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet
I feel terrible
Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself
I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny
Of course you feel terrible You completely screwed up your karma
You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?
It's not superstition It's practically Newtonian
For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction
Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug
It's actually a very elegant system You know, what goes around comes around
Speaking of what goes around comes around
Okay, look
Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here,
what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
It won't work The diameter of the tubing is insufficient
What if we reposition the collection tank?
It won't work No way to mount it
Okay, here's an idea What if I change my name and go live
with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?
That could work
- Morning - Morning What's up?
Nothing We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity
pasta maker
I'm gonna make a coffee run Do you want any?
No, thanks I have coffee
Great So how'd it go with Stuart last night?
I really don't want to talk about it
Yeah Right Sure
The thing is, before you guys went out,
I spoke to him and
I said I don't want to talk about it
I just I kind of
What goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business
So just leave it alone, okay?
If you want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin' latte
Hang on, I think I've got this Help me see if we can wedge
this little piece of PVC behind the support rod
You're overestimating the tensile strength
of the substructure you're building
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing
If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet
where my coffee table should be
Howard, wait
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC
to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
Because this is not a spare part from the space station
This is the thing from the pizza box
that keeps the lid from touching the cheese
That what that's for? In India, the lid touches the cheese
Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera,
so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie
- Where are you going? - Comic book store
An excellent idea! I could certainly use a break
- Me, too - You can go to the comic book store
when man can once again safely poop in space
Why does Leonard get to go?
'Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny
and if I have to hear about it again, I'm going to kick him in his ovaries
- Thanks for understanding, Howard - I got your back, sister
All right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test
Hand me that Tupperware
That's heavy
Damn right it's heavy It's my mother's meat loaf
It's been testing toilets for generations
I must say,
I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances
might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test
with meat loaf analog in
three, two, one
Fascinating
What do you think the problem is?
Not enough bread crumbs
Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you
- Sure, what's up? - I gave you bad advice about Penny,
- and I want to apologize - No, your advice was great
- It was? - Yeah, going slow really worked
You're kidding
Never worked for me
Last night at dinner, I did what you told me
I went really slow, I kept my distance,
and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine
It doesn't matter, that's where it all went to hell
During the kissing?
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once
No, everything was good and really hot
And I said,
"Oh, Penny,"
and right where she was supposed to say, "Oh, Stuart," she said
your name
That is your name, right?
I'm sorry That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear
It beats, "You know I'm a dude, right?"
Yeah, it was pretty bad
No doubt, no doubt
I'm sorry it didn't work out
Not your fault
Yeah, how about that?
- See you soon - Sure
Yes, sir, I understand "classified"
We'll keep it all classified; no one has to know but you and me
What's classified?
Howard's space toilet I'll tell you later
Well, they've deployed our solution
Let's just all hope it works
I don't see why I have to worry
My career's not hanging in the balance
That was a joke
It's funny,
because it's true
Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
Yeah, I said "Leonard"
Yes, you did, didn't you?
What the hell is that?
Meatloaf
What was it doing on the ceiling?
That's classified
Houston, International Space Station 
We have a little situation up here 
We'd like to make an unscheduled space walk 
ISS, Houston 
Which crew members would be involved in this EVA? 
Houston, we'd all like to step outside for a few minutes 
ISS, I'm afraid we can't authorize that 
Houston, this is more of an FYI call 
We are basically out the door 
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Oh, boy
What?
I can't comment without violating our agreement
that I not criticize your work
Then what was "Oh, boy"?
Great restraint on my part
There's nothing wrong with the science here
Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say, "Science"
How's that?
You actually had it right in the first place
Once again, you've fallen for one of my classic pranks
Bazinga!
Now here's a peculiar e-mail
The president of the university wants me to meet him
at his office tomorrow morning at 8:00 am
- Why? - It doesn't say
It must be an emergency
Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at 8:00
and move my bowels at 8:20
Yes, how did we live before Twitter?
I guess you'll find out what it is in the morning
That's 14 hours away
For the next 840 minutes,
I'm effectively one of Heisenberg's particles;
I know where I am or I know how fast I'm going,
but I can't know both
Yet how am I supposed to carry on
with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?
I know the feeling
Subtitles: The FW Team
Sheldon, it's 2:00 in the morning
Why does everybody keep telling me what time it is?
- Everybody? - You, the president of the university,
his wife, their sullen teenage daughter
That entire family is fascinated by what time it is
and whether people know it
You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night?
He didn't respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted
Tell me what my other option was
You could have waited until morning
I know, look who I'm talking to
Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted
to the National Science Foundation
to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it
How nice
Well, a space opened up
at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle
Wait a minute
He offered to send you to the North Pole?
In fact, he was quite enthusiastic
He said, "Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would"
Okay, well, do you want to go?
Of course not I'm a theoretical physicist
A career I chose in no small part because it's indoors,
but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there,
I will be the scientis to confirm string theory
People will write books about me
Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas
depicting scenes from my life
Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death
Sarcasm?
Maybe
I'm on the horns of a dilemma
Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?
Easy peasy, I'm doing it right now
I'm not good with cold
How often have we had to leave a movie theater
because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast?
- I can't go - Then don't go
How can you say that?
The scientific opportunity of a lifetime
presents itself and my best friend says "Don't go"
- All right, then go - Listen to you
How can I possibly go?
What are the words I can say right now
to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?
Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question
- How was it resolved? - It wasn't
His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot
Just imagine If he says yes,
we'll have an entire summer without Sheldon
We could play outside
We could sit on the left side of the couch
I could use the bathroom at 8:20
Our dreams are very small, aren't they?
Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted
 the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition
It's not gonna be the same without you
Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature
I don't like where this is going
I would like to propose
that the three of you accompany me
To the North Pole?
Is this just so we won't touch your stuff while you're away?
I'll admit that was a concern
But the fact is, I'll need a support team
And the three of you are my first choice
Really?
There are others who might be more qualified,
but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomachache
I know I'm proposing an enormous undertaking
So, why don't you take a few moments to discuss it?
We're not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
I'm still within earshot!
You may want to wait for my door to close
We're not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
Hang on Let's talk about it
This is a National Science Foundation expedition
I don't know how we can turn it down
Easy Instead of saying, "No, we don't want to go on an NSF expedition,"
say, "No, we don't want to spend
"three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag"
But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory,
we could drink for free in any bar in any college town
with a university that has a strong science program
Howard, this is big science
You could be the engineer who builds the equipment
that puts us on the cover of magazines
I could also be the engineer
who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon
You still might get on a magazine
So you guys are seriously considering this?
- You think you can put up with Sheldon? - Well, I'm a Hindu
My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life
we are rewarded in the next
Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon,
and I'm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!
Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?
- I'm in - Me, too
Damn it Peer pressure Fine
Excellent Just an FYI,
as I am the expedition's team leader,
protocol dictates that be phrased, "Fine, sir"
But don't worry, there will be a briefing
What do you want?
I need access to the Cheesecake Factory's walk-in freezer
Honey, I already told you,
the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature
This is to train
for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole
What?
I don't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you
but to elaborate, I'm going to the Arctic Circle
with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali
- You're all going? - Yes
- For three months? - Yes
Excuse me
Is that a yes or a no on the freezer?
That woman has the attention span of a gnat
Sheldon says you're going to the North Pole
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah I'm just a little surprised you didn't tell me
It all happened kind of fast
And we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear
and study up on, you know, snow and stuff
Sorry, I was gonna tell you
You don't have to apologize There's no reason you have to tell me
I was just you know, surprised
You were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating
Now where do we stand on the freezer?
- Is he serious? - Actually, it would help
All right, I'll see what I can do
So, three months at the North Pole
That is awesome
I'm sorry, but at what point do you put this
"see what you can do" plan into action?
Just a warning, Sheldon
The freezer locks from the outside
Did she seem upset to you?
Did she seem upset to you?
Good, I got it right
Are you upset?
- A little bit - Two for two I'm on fire
I know she's not my girlfriend or anything,
but wouldn't you think she'd feel a little bad
that I'm going to be gone for the whole summer?
That feels like a bonus question
I'm going to stop here while I'm ahead, but I've had a great time
All right,
the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us
to the use of tools in extreme temperatures
such as we will face in the Arctic Circle
Where are your tools?
Right here
All right, team, open up your practice kits
As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment
we'll be using to the Cheesecake Factory,
because apparently, I'm "ridiculous,"
I've provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills
Leonard, you will be doing a series
of complex mathematical problems
on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received
when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade
Treat it with respect
Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke
on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf
Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a mustache
Wolowitz, you will be completing
a series of delicate surgical procedures
on the classic children's game "Operation"
To begin with, you will
"remove funny bone for two hundred dollars"
For this I went to MIT
And begin
I think I swallowed some paint!
I can't press any of the buttons with my gloves
Son of a bitch!
Adversity is to be expected Continue
Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued
- Okay, I can't do this - Me either
Gentlemen, use your imagination Innovate
Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth?
He cut open a tauntaun
and used its internal body heat to warm him up
You heard the man Hold him down and I'll cut him open
Hang on, I know I don't possess the tools of leadership,
but why can't we assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside?
I hadn't thought of that
I guess we're done here
Here,
drink slash eat this
- What is it? - Hot chocolate with a stick of butter
Okay, why?
In the frigid temperatures in the Arctic,
we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day
just to maintain our body weight
You know I can't eat butter I'm lactose intolerant
Way ahead of you, that's an "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" stick
But Mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole
I don't care what the other guys are doing 
If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal 
and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them? 
If you were standing behind me nagging, I might
Don't talk back to your mother This trip is much too dangerous 
No, it's not Howard, tell them
Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, namaste 
I understand your concern, but if it'll make you feel any better,
my mother is fine with me going,
and it's a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17
So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus? 
That's very unlikely, Mrs Koothrappali
If Raj dies,
it'll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn
or being ripped to shreds by a 1,500 pound polar bear
Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone with Raj's parents
Can you tell them that you're okay with me going to the Arctic?
Arctic?! I thought you said Arkansas! 
I didn't say that You never listen to me!
He doesn't tell me anything! 
He lives a secret life because he's ashamed! 
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Sure, but let's go out here
where there's a little less yelling and guilt
What's up?
Well, I got you a little going away present
- A blanket - No, not just a blanket
See, it has sleeves
So, you can be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff
Cool
I'm gonna miss you
- See you later - Bye
I told you no! Why don't you believe me? 
'Cause it doesn't make sense to me! 
How can it be that in the entire country of India, 
there isn't one Outback Steakhouse?! 
I want a cookie, Meemaw
It's me
But Meemaw just made cookies
I don't know if I can go on the expedition
What?
I don't think I can go to the North Pole
I know you're concerned about disappointing me
but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge
that my expectations of you are very low
Yeah, that's very comforting
Comforting is a part of leadership
It's not a part I care for, but such is my burden
Terrific, it's just that I don't think Penny wants me to go
Assuming that's a valid reason not to go, which it isn't
How do you know this? Did she say it?
Not exactly
But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this
- What is it? - It's a blanket with sleeves
That's clever
Let me see if I understand correctly
Her missing you
is an emotional state you find desirable?
Yes, obviously
Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving,
logic dictates you must leave
Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone for three months
What if she doesn't miss me that long and she meets someone else?
She does have a short attention span
So, I can't go
Leonard, you may be right
It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life
in a very intimate and carnal fashion
- You really think so? - Of course not
Even in my sleep-deprived state,
I've managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks
Bazinga!
- What time is it? - It's 7:00 am I'm sorry it's early,
but we're leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you
What did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?
I don't know
You'll be gone and I'll notice
What about this? What does this mean?
Wine, credit card and late night television
are a bad combination
All right, fine
What about that really long hug? What did that mean?
That wasn't a long hug
It was at least five Mississippis
A standard hug is two Mississippis tops
Leonard, I don't know what to tell you It was just a hug
- Glad we cleared that up - Yeah
I guess I'll see you
- Okay, have a safe trip - Thank you
- Bye - Okay, bye
It means I wish you weren't going
- Damn it - What?
We're out of ice
All right, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment
starting tomorrow at 0700 hours,
but until then, you are all off duty
I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum
as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled
- What are you working on? - Crossbow
Hey, guys, can I just say something?
How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now?
This is literally the top of the world
Only a handful of people in all of human history
will ever see what we are going to see
He's right
It is remarkable
So, who's up for a movie?
Good idea, what do you think?
Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter's The Thing ?
- I say double feature - Dinner's ready!
- What are we having? - Reconstituted Thai food
Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
- Freeze-dried spicy mustard? - Check
Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?
Sorry
Not to worry
I hid it
Bazinga!
You're in my spot
There's no time for a crossbow Find me an icicle
Three months This is gonna be great
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
I just want you both to know,
when I publish my findings, I won't forget your contributions
- Great - Thanks
Of course, I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech,
but when I get around to writing my memoirs,
you can expect a very effusive footnote and perhaps a signed copy
We have to tell him
Tell me what?
Damn his Vulcan hearing
You fellows are planning a party for me, aren't you?
Okay, Sheldon, sit down
If there's going to be a theme, I should let you know
that I don't care for luau, toga or "under the sea"
Yeah, we'll keep that in mind Look
We need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole
If this is about the night the heat went out,
there's nothing to be embarrassed about
- It's not about that - We agreed to never speak of it again
So we slept together naked
It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting
He's speaking about it
For me, it was a bonding moment
Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks
we were looking for magnetic monopoles
and not finding anything
and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?
We were gonna be gentle with him
That's why I added the "tator"
And when we finally got our first positive data,
you were so happy
In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital "D"
Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected
wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles
as it was
static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off
He just went colon, capital "O"
- You tampered with my experiment? - We had to
It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian
You see that? I add the "ensian "
Did Leonard know about this?
Leonard's my best friend in the world Surely Leonard didn't know
It was his idea
Of course it was The whole plan reeks of Leonard
- I missed you so much - I missed you, too
I couldn't think of anyone else while you were gone
Me, neither
Except for one night when the heat went out
Long story Don't ask
Do not make a sound
Whispering, "Do not make a sound "
is a sound
Damn his Vulcan hearing
Not a good time, Sheldon
Oh, this is ridiculous
- What? - Hello
I realize you're currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges,
but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you,
may I interrupt this one?
Great to see you too Come on in
Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception
Do you have anything to say for yourself?
Yes, I feel terrible about it
I will never forgive myself, I don't expect you to, either,
and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny
for a session of self-criticism and repentance
Can someone please tell me what's going on here?
What's going on is I was led to believe
I was making groundbreaking strides in science,
when in fact, I was being
fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali
and your furry little boy toy
Is that true?
It was the only way to make him happy
Make him happy?
When he wasn't happy, we wanted to kill him
There was even a plan
We were going to throw his Kindle outside,
when he went to get it, lock the door
and let him freeze to death
That seems like a bit of an overreaction
The overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs
to four different sled dog teams and yell, "Mush "
We kept the original data
You can still publish the actual results
Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful
and I've already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university
explaining that I have confirmed string theory
and forever changed man's understanding of the universe
Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn't have done that
So write another e-mail Set the record straight No big deal
You're right, Leonard
It's not a big deal
All you did was lie to me, destroy my dream
and humiliate me in front of the whole university
That, FYI, was sarcasm
I, in fact, believe it is a big deal
The poor thing
- Yeah, I feel terrible - Wait Wait
Aren't you going to go talk to him?
He'll be fine The guy's a trouper Come here
You're right, you shouldn't talk to him I will
Man, I cannot catch a break
Do you want to talk?
About what?
Being betrayed by my friends?
Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing?
And I didn't even get to go to Comic-Con!
Oh, hon
Soft kitty, warm kitty 
That's for when I'm sick Sad is not sick
Sorry I don't know your sad song
I don't have a sad song I'm not a child
You know, I do understand what you're going through
Really?
Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school,
one of my friends heard I was gonna be named head cheerleader
I was so excited
My mom even made me a celebration pie
Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader
Big ol' slutbag
Are you saying
that you think a "celebration pie"
is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
They're pretty tasty
And on a different, but not unrelated topic,
based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits,
do you truly believe that you were ever fit
to be a cheerleader?
Look, Sheldon, I just don't think that the guys and Leonard
really meant to hurt you
They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation
You know what it's like?
Remember that scene in the new Star Trek when Kirk has to take over the ship,
so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn't true,
like saying Spock didn't care his mom died?
I missed Comic-Con and the New Star Trek movie!
- I like the new look - Thanks
I call it "the Clooney"
I call it "the Mario and Luigi," but whatever
How's Sheldon doing?
He came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet
and tried to choke me to death with the force,
so I'd say, "a little better"
If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally You know
Personally, I don't care, but my genitals wanted me to ask
Tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business
He says they didn't do it
Sheldon, over here
What are you doing?
I feel bad for the guy
Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?
Because I am without friends
Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone
Even while seated
Come on We said we were sorry
It's going to take more than an "I'm sorry"
and a store-bought apology pie from Penny
to make up for what you've done to me
Read your retraction email
Way to destroy your reputation
You see?
People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning
That's not true
People have been pointing and laughing at you your whole life
I've had enough
Attention, everyone
I'm Dr Sheldon Cooper
As many of you in the physics department might know,
my career trajectory has taken a minor detour
Off a cliff
My credibility may have been damaged
Completely wrecked
But I would like to remind you that in science,
there's no such thing as failure
There once was a man
who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant
as the single "biggest blunder" of his career
That man's name was surprise, surprise
Albert Einstein
Yeah, but research into dark energy
proved that Einstein's cosmological constant
was actually right all along, so you're still
surprise, surprise
A loser
You think you're so clever
Let me just tell you,
while I do not currently have a scathing retort,
you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy
So much for our friendship with Sheldon
We'll always have the night the heat went out
Since we got interrupted last night,
I didn't have a chance to give you this
You shouldn't have
Oh, boy!
What is it?
It's a snowflake
From the North Pole
Are you serious?
It's eternal
I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin
That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me
that I didn't understand
It's actually a simple process
Cyanoacrylates are monomers which polymerize on
Red alert, Leonard Sheldon ran away
Man, I cannot catch a break
So, how do you know he ran away?
Well, he's not answering his phone,
he handed in his resignation at the university
and he sent me a text that said, "I'm running away"
Thanks for letting me know
Aren't you going to do something?
Of course I'm going to do something
Howard, you check the comic book store Raj, go to the thai restaurant
I'll stay here with Penny in her apartment
Oh, damn it
It's Sheldon's mother
A break cannot be caught
Hi, Mrs Cooper
He is? Sheldon went home to Texas
Yeah, no, I know he resigned
I guess it kind of is our fault
No, you're right Someone needs to come talk to him
Don't worry, I'll take care of it
All right
New plan
Howard, you and Raj go to Texas I'll stay with Penny in her apartment
You're not gonna go with them?
Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake
and we were kissing and
Come on, I don't want to go to Texas!
Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once
We're done
Trust me, you'll be fine See ya
Well, wait a second, Leonard
Come on, how can you not go? He's your best friend
Yeah, but I already saw him naked Just come here
I promise I will be here when you get back
Just go help Sheldon
- Really? - Yeah
We waited a few months We can wait a few more days
Maybe you can
Go
Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?
Here you go, Shelly
Thanks, Mom
Hold your horses, young man
Here in Texas, we pray before we eat
Aw, Mom
This is not California, land of the heathen
Gimme
By His hand we are all
 fed
Give us, Lord, our daily
 bread
- Please know that we are truly -  grateful
- For every cup and every -  plateful
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
My objection was based on considerations
other than difficulty
Whatever Jesus still loves you
Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich
Oh, I know how to take care of my baby
His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he's Chinese
So, do you want to talk about
what happened with you and your little friends?
- They're not my friends - All right
If you recall, when you were little,
we sat right here at this very spot
and we talked about the problems
you had getting along with the neighbor kids
That was different
They were threatened by my intelligence
and too stupid to know that's why they hated me
Oh baby, they knew very well why they hated you
I can't believe you bought a red cowboy hat
Hello? I'm wearing a red turtleneck
Plus, it was the only boys' large they had
I'm sorry, this does not look like Texas
Where's the tumbleweeds? Whe's the saloons?
Saloons?
Like in the movies I saw growing up in India
You know, Four for Texas , Yellow Rose of Texas 
This neighborhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre 
I was really hoping to see a cattle drive
What can I tell you?
They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there
Will you please take that stupid hat off?
No, I want to blend in
To what? Toy Story? 
- Hi, boys - Howdy, ma'am
Howdy to you, too You got here quick
- We took the red-eye - Well, come on in
Thank you kindly
- Can I get you something to drink? - No, thank you
If y'all don't mind, I got a hankerin' for a Lone Star beer
There's no alcohol in this household Stop talking like that and lose the hat
Sorry I'll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it
You'll take a cola
What about you? Radge, isn't it?
You still having trouble talking to the ladies?
Because, at our church,
we have a woman who's an amazing healer
Mostly she does crutch and wheelchair people,
but I bet she'd be willing to take a shot
at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you
If you don't mind,
there's a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles
and you have no idea how much I want to be on it
- A girl? - Uh, yes, ma'am
Oh, good I been praying for you
- What are they doing here? - We came to apologize
- Again - And bring you home
Why don't you pack up your stuff and we'll head back?
No, this is my home now
Thanks to you, my career is over
and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas
trying to teach evolution to creationists
You watch your mouth, Shelly
Everyone's entitled to their opinion
Evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact
And that is your opinion
I forgive you Let's go home
Don't tell me prayer doesn't work
How about that? I finally caught a break
You know how they say when friends have sex,
it can get weird?
Sure
Why does it have to get weird?
I don't know
I mean,
we were friends, and now we're more than friends
We're whatever "this" is
But why label it, right? I mean
It is what it is and
- Leonard? It's weird - Totally
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card,
and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines
Choke on that, sucka
Okay, well, then I'll just cut your vines with my ruby sword
That's right, I did it I cut 'em
Um
I have a question
Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,
elf beats water sprite,
and basically everything beats enchanted bunny
Unless you have the carrot power
Okay, I've got another question
When does this get fun?
Are we going to talk
or are we going to play "Mystic Warriors of Ka-ah"?
Just play potion card
Which one?
It doesn't matter
You can't possibly win
Sheldon, don't ruin the game
How could he ruin the game?
Given the cards that have already been played,
Penny can only be holding necromancer potions,
which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers,
and there are no more of either left to be drawn
The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are:
four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris
See? Ruined
Sheldon, that is incredible
From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so
Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory
"Photographic" is a misnomer
I have an eidetic memory, as I've told you many times
Most recently last year during lunch
on the afternoon of may seventh
You had turkey and complained it was dry
Well, I guess game'over
Really? Oh, great
I mean, aw
Okay, I gotta go Why?
Because the last me I didn't go,
I ended up playing "mystic warlords of ka"
Not "Ka Ka-ah"
Buh-eye
See ya
Still can't believe she's going out with me
Nobody can
That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you
What?
You and I made a pact
that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend,
That person would have his girlfriend
hook the other guy up
with one of her girlfriends
I don't remember that
June 30th, 2004
Opening day of spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena
They only had red icees, no blue
Oh, yeah
So you've been with Penny for like a month and a half now
Where's my shorty, Morty?
Howard, you can't hold me to that
Why not?
Because when I made that agreement,
I didn't think I'd ever have a hot girlfriend
And I was positive you never would
Hey, how come I wasn't part of this deal?
You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge
in your customary preemptive pre-show urination
Oh, so that's how it works?
I have a teeny bladder and now I don't get a hot girlfriend?
Yeah, Raj That's how it works
Damn
* our whole universe was in a hot, dense state * 
* then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait! * 
* the earth began to cool * 
* the autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals develop tools * 
* we built the wall * * we built the pyramids * 
* math, science, history, unraveling the mystery * 
* that all started with a big bang* 
* bang! * 
Oh, damn it Can I have a napkin?
I'm sorry, no
But you have a whole bunch of 'em
Yes, I've moved to a four-napkin system
Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies
If you like, starting tomorrow,
I'll add a guest napkin,
but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today
Good luck That's the face napkin
So, have you talked to Penny yet?
No, I haven't
Why not?
Because I've been busy, because I haven't figured out
a way to bring it up,
and mostly and I can't stress how key this is
because I don't want to
Leonard, a pact is a pact
You have to get Penny to fix me up
It's not that simple
What am I supposed to say?
"Penny, do you have any friends
you'd like to never hear from again?"
Come on, I'm smart,
I have good job and I have only three percent body fat
It's true
I've seen him at the beach
He's like a human chicken wing
Leonard, come on
Fine I'll ask if she has a friend for you
Hot friend
Right
And tall
I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain
before they're 20
Ii'll see what I can do
Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?
I'd imagine you heard any number of things today
When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, "hello, Raj"
"How are you, Raj?"
Given that you're wearing a new sweater-vest,
you may have heard "new sweater6vest?"
And possibly, though far less likely, "nice sweater-vest"
Why don't I just tell you what i heard today
That would probably save us some time
Saturday night at the comic book store,
they're having a "mystic warlords of ka-ah" tournament
First prize is $500
If we team up, we'd be unstoppable
I'm sorry, Raj, but I have no interest
in playing a game in which I find no challenge
What about the money?
I have money
This is other money
How does it different from the money I have?
Half of it will be mine
Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
Leonard, help
Are you kidding?
I couldn't even talk him into giving one of his freakin' napkins
Wow, you really are a genius
Not really
I googled how to do that
So, listen have you ever made a pact with someone?
OkAy, fine, like a pinky swear
Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I
made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie
You know, from Sesame Street?
I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie
Knowing fact, we both wanted Ernie
We didn't speak again until middle school
Over puppets?
The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard
Okay
Speaking of what the heart wants
Um, a long time ago,
I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you
Okay, I don't know where you're going with this,
but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have
No, no, nothing like that
The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend,
we'd have her fix the other one up
with one of her friends
And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex
Well, I sure as hell wasn't gonna bring it up before sex
And during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so
I'm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends
It doesn't have to be a good friend
And you know that deep down inside, Howard's a really nice guy
The problem isn't what's on the inside
It's the creepy candy coating
Will you at least think about it?
Just as a favor to me?
Oh, great thing about Ernie,
was he never asked me for anything
He just gave
Got it Got it Got it Got it Got it Got it
Betty and Veronica?
Oh
Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine's coming in tomorrow
Want me to set one aside for you?
Thank you
You just robbed me of the opportunity
to stumb upon the figurine
and make the oh-so-satisfying journey
from discovery to desire to possession
All right, I won't set one aside for you
But I must have it
Okay, I'll set one aside for you Thank you
You know, I can buy all these things online
I come here for the personal service
Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up
For the mystic warlords tournament
The Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?
Yeah, he lives around here Big gamer
Excuse me
Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher
on Star Trek: The next generation
is going to be participating in your tournament?
Oh, I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?
You don't understand
Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton?
Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me
Ooh, what a coincidence
Meanwhile you're playing in the tournament
Sign here I was such a fan
that in 1995, I traveled ten hours by bus
to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi,
wearing my star flee academy cadet uniform
in order to meet Wil Wheaton
and get him to autograph
my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure
Ooh, it'll be like a reunion then
Sign here
My arduous journey, however,
was for naught
Although advertised to appear, he did not show up
It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton
Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him
Sign here
It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton
currently ranks sixth on my a-time enemies list
right between director Joel Schumacher,
Who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise,
and Billy Sparks,
who lived down the street from me
and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle
Okay, I get it He's a bad guy
Sign here
In the words of khan noonn singh
in the immortal wrath ofhan, "he tasks me
He tasks me and I shall have him"
No doubt, sign here
From hell's heart, I stab at thee"
All right, Raj, looks like you're teamed up
with "die, Wil Wheaton, die"
So, tell me more about the future mother of my children
She's adorable, Howard
I think you'll like her
Great
So what did you tell her about me?
Did you mention the body fat?
No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her
Good, good
I just told her you're an aerospace engineer,
you speak five languages
six if you count Klingon
Girls don't count Klingon, Howard
Right?
Right
Oh And I told her you have
an unhealthy attachment to your mother
What?
I'm kidding
Another delightful surprise for her
Sheldon, it's your play
Sheldon
My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy
with a cursed mace Game
Sorry, boys
Say hi to your mother when she picks you up
Or I could just tell her later tonight!
We pawned them, dude! Up top!
Look at him
Wil Wheaton, my old friend
I have chased you 'round the moons of Nibia
and 'round the Antares maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames!
You know, you keep quoting Wrath of Khan,
but he was in next generation
It's a totally different set of characters
Silence!
How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match
and we beat lonely Larry and captain sweatpants
in the next round,
we'll face off for the championship
So, my path to satisfaction is blocked
by lonely Larry and captain sweatpants
Very well
They must be destroyed
Dude, you have to stop talking like that
It's really lame
Silence!
So, Penny tells me you're working as a waitress
to put yourself through grad school
That's pretty great What are you studying?
Microbiology
Oh, cool So you could study me
I don't understand
Microbiology is the study of tiny living things
I know, I'm studying it
And I said you could study me 'cause I'm a tiny living thing
It's a joke
Are you sure?
Do you like science-fiction?
No
Role-playing games?
Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?
Either
No
Gonna be a long night
Well, it's your fault
I had to ask You didn't have to say yes
You like magic?
Not really
Okay
I play my endless serpent Raj will play ecstatic frenzy,
which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord
Then captain sweatpants, molten river
I play nightshade dryad Game, set and match
Now fetch me Wil Wheaton!
Bot-tash bir jab-loo-di rekh kkhakkh-o ny!
Did that guy just say
"revenge is a dish best served cold" in Klingon?
I believe so
What is wrong with him?
Everyone has a different theory
How about computers?
Do you like computers?
I use them I don't like them
Okay
Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?
A puppy once bit my face
Of course it did
How about that? Einstein was wrong
What?
Approaching the speed of light
doesn't slow down time
Approaching them does
Excuse me
Oh, damn It's my mother
Are you going to answer it?
I'm torn
She might be dying, and, you know,
I wouldn't want to miss that
On the other hand,
if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over
I know how you feel My mother makes me crazy
Not as crazy as my mother makes me
Oh, yeah?
Does your mother call you every day at work
to see if you've had a healthy lunch?
My mother calls me at workk
to see if I had a healthy bowel movement
Okay, well, does she lay out
your clothes for you in the morning
like you're nine years old?
You live with your mother?
No That's the sad part
Ooh, rough
Okay, check this out
My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten
so I wouldn't pick up a disease from the other children
That's nothing
I couldn't ride a bicycle
'cause my mother was afraid I'd hit a bump
and lose my virginity
Oh, wow
You didn't, did you?
Not on a bicyclle
In a camry
Oh!
Corolla!
More wine? I'd love some
Listen, you have to come
to shabbat dinner at my house sometime
Why?
A catholic girl like you
wearing a big cross like that
might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm
I've been hoping for
Okay, but only if you come
to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke
It's a date
Am I a matchmaker or what?
Lava serpent
Nest of snakes
Underworld guardian
Underworld guardian
We skirmish to the death
Invisibility spell
Luminescence spell
Water nymph
Fire demon
Two-aded tiger
Three-headed lion
Sulphur
Brimstone
Problem, Wil Wheaton?
Hang on
You're holding two moderate spell cards,
a small rock and a potion of Zancor,
which will be about as much help
as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth
Your only move is to play the potion,
lose the skirmish,
a nd two moves later, the game
I think he's got me
The year was 1995
The place: Jackson, Mississippi
Having spent ten hours on a bus,
during which I had to twice violate
my personal rule against relieving myself
on board a moving vehicle
I finally arrived
at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention
only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had
better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure
What?
You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton
You went to the '95 Dixie-Trek?
Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died,
and I had to go to her funeral
Your mee-maw died?
That's terrible
Yeah, it was
But I'm really sorry that I disappointed you
No, no, I understand
Anything happened to my mee-maw,
I'd be one inconsolable moon pie
I should clarify that statement
by explaining that she calls me "moon pie"
It'a special relationship, isn't it,
between a boy and his grandmother?
Oh, yes
Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas!
Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!
It's okay, Sheldon
I let you down
I deserve it
Potion of Zancor
What are you waiting for?!
Kill Wil Wheaton!
From hell's heart, stab at him!
I can't
Sure you can Do it! Do it!
No
I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton,
the man who destroyed my dreams
But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved is mee-maw
Enchanted bunny
No! Not enchanted bunny!
I call my mee-maw "nana"
And she's going be very happy
to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny
Game over, moon pie
I I I don't understand
Your grandmother's alive?
Oh, you catch on quick
Come on, Stewie, let's get our prize money
That was fun
Wheaton!
Wheaton! Wheaton!

Kites, ho!
Kites, ho!
Excuse me
You're misusing the word "ho"
It's an interjection used to call attention
to a destination, not an object,
as in "land, ho!" or "westward, ho!"
Kites, ho!
Hey, guys Whatcha doin'?
Going out to discover electricity?
If you're referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin,
he did not "discover electricity,"
he merely used a kite to determine that lignining consists of electricity
He also invented the Franklin stove,
bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter
Kites, ho
- We're heading for some kite fighting - "Kite fighting"?
It's an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport
Actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low
On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-present danger
You want to come watch?
Gee sounds amazing
But, I've got some friends coming over
Not a big thing we're gonna watch the Nebraska game
Football, sure
Good guess
I would've invited you, but you're not a football fan
No, no, I'm not, so great
You've got plans doing something you like,
I've got plans doing something I like,
it's good
Maybe we'll hang out later, after everybody's gone
Yeah, great
See ya
Well, this sucks
I'm sorry, I got bored and drifted off
Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?
Leonard realized that Penny's been hiding him from her friends
because he's a tiny, little man who flies kites
That certainly would suck
Episode 306: The Cornhusker Vortex
Sync: Golgi, Linwelin, Loky
wwwsubbercafefr
Wolowitz is trying to outflank us
Let out some string, add altitude and I'll go under and cut his line
Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me?
Focus, Leonard, focus!
The heat of battle is upon us The dogs of war are unleashed
Maybe Koothrappali's right Maybe I embarrass her
You're embarrassing me
A grown man worrying about such nonsense
when in the middle of flying kites
Sorry
Sorry won't bring their kites down
String burn!
They think we're flanking They're playing right into our hands
On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor
One, two
- Did you see that? - What?
That chick, she smiled at me
- No - Yes, she did
- Come on, scissors, scissors! - Hold my line
What are you doing? I can't scissors by myself!
Come back!
Victory!
Son of a bitch
You're a sucky friend, you know that?
A sucky, sucky friend
What was I supposed to do? She gave me that "come-hit her" look
If she gave you any look at all, it was a "you suck" look
I would've caught up to her if I hadn't pulled a hammy
Please, you weigh 80 pounds You don't have a hammy
Penny doesn't want me around her friends
I embarrass her What else could it be?
Her actions could be out of concern for your feelings
Perhaps she's excluded you from these gatherings
because she's scouting for a new mate
and doesn't want to do it in front of you
How kind of her
Agreed
Most primates don't show that sort of discretion
A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one
without so much as a "how do you do?"
You always do this
You ditch me for a woman you don't have a shot with
I had a shot
With a woman you were chasing through a park
that's not a shot, that's a felony
What's worse, it cost me my prized patang fighting kite
I don't suppose there's any chance you could give me my kite back?
I'm sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare
dictate that the fallen kite go to the victor
And without rules, the competition has no meaning
And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture
I have your kite
I have your kite
How was your football party?
It was pretty good We won
That's excellent
It's a weird figure of speech
"We won" when you weren't actually playing
When we watch Star Wars , we don't say, "We defeated the Empire "
I'm glad to hear it
On a related subject,
are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?
Oh, my god, no Why would you ask that?
You know, I just noticed I haven't really met any of them
Sure you have
I met the huge ex-boyfriend
and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend
By the way, were they here today?
- Of course not - Why would they be?
Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don't you stop me?
If you want to meet my friends, that would be great
You know, I didn't want you to be bored
I wouldn't be bored Why would I be bored?
'Cause they're not genius scientists
Penny, I like all sorts of people
Some of my best friends aren't geniuses
Like who?
Some of my Facebook friends aren't geniuses
My point is, if we're going to be a couple,
I should be friends with your friends
Great
Then come over next Saturday and watch the game with us
Another football game?
They have them every week
Did not know that
- You wanted to meet my friends - Sure
Just I don't know much about football
A lot of the guys' girlfriends don't know football
They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen
Great
Okay, a completed pass
First down, New England
- I think I'm starting to get this - Really?
The only thing I've learned is that American men love drinking beer,
pee too often and have trouble getting erections
Focus on the game, not the commercials
Maybe if you people cut back on the beer,
you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women
without pharmaceutical help
Raj, what are you doing here?
You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa
I'm sorry, are you under the impression that we're still friends?
Come on
You're not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?
It's not just the kite thing Every time we go some place,
you think you can dump me when someone prettier comes along,
even though you don't have a shot with them
I had a shot with that jogger
Fine Paint green flames on your little scooter with her
It's not a little scooter
It's the second biggest Vespa they make!
Are you watching football?
There's no fooling you
Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?
All I know about Saks is my mother shops there
Sacks, sacks
It's football nomenclature
for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage
Scrimmage
The line of scrimmage
is the imaginary transverse line separating the offense from the defense
Sheldon knows football?
Apparently
I mean, Quidditch, sure But football?
Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?
I grew up in Texas Football is ubiquitous in Texas:
Pro football, college football,
high school football, peewee football
in fact, every form of football except the original European football
Which most Texans believe to be a commie plot
Unbelievable
If you're interested, I also know all about frying meat
that isn't chicken as if it were chicken
So you could teach me?
Football or chicken-fried meats?
Football
I'm going to Penny's to watch a game with her friends
and I don't want to look like an idiot I want to blend in
If you want to blend in
I'd think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage
Come on, please teach me about football It'll be fun
That's exactly what my father said
"Come to the games Watch the games"
Week in and week out from the time I was five
until I went off to college
Longest seven years of my life
Please, I'm asking you as a friend
Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
Fine
I really appreciate this
All right, poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen
I'm sorry?
That's how my father always began our football conversations
And if you'd like, after the game, I'll take you outside
and teach you how to shoot close enough to a raccoon that it craps itself
When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
When I have enough to destroy all the human toast
on the Battlestar known as Galactica
Is that what you're wearing to watch football at Penny's?
- What's wrong with a football jersey? - Nothing
That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress
It's the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs
I can't believe they had one for dogs
Oh, yes
Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas
Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel
My sister found that out the hard way
Anyway, wish me luck
Leonard, wait Am I correct in assuming
that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers
is based on your desire to ensure
your continuing mating privileges with her?
Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way
How would you put it?
Like you said
Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse
Don't you have access to women who will do it for money?
By the way,
another accepted usage for the term "ho"
Good-bye, Sheldon
Hold on
I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-handed
Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in, not get laughed at
What's funny about Cylon toast?
It's open
Hey, pal
What do you want?
I brought you a little gift
New kite
The kite you made me lose was an authentic patang,
an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi
It took me a day to put together and two days to paint
This is Hello Kitty
Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse
Does a patang?
You just don't get it, do you?
Buying me something pretty isn't going to make our problem just go away
Look, I admit I haven't always been the best friend I could be
You've been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend
- Stipulated - And you do it all the time
Last week in the mall,
we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother,
and I suddenly realize you're not even there
- I know - And where were you?
Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick
But in my defense, she was gorgeous!
And working that squeezer to make the lemonade,
going up and down and up and down
It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court
You're impossible
At least, I can talk to women without being drunk
Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder
You're just a douche
No You know what?
Maybe that's what this whole thing's about
You're not mad at me, you're mad at yourself
No, I'm mad at you
I hate myself, but I'm mad at you
Fine You're mad at me I get it
How about we go spend the day together?
Just the two of us We'll go anywhere you want
I don't know
Come on
Let me take you someplace nice
I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits
Really, now? With the traffic and the parking?
Okay, fine
The Tar Pits Let's go
Why can't I stay mad at you?
Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?
Sweetie, that's a highlight from the '98 championship game
Did not know that
- How much beer have you had? - None, why?
I was just hoping you were drunk
- Now we're back live - Okay, yeah
I can see the difference
Oh, where's the flag? That's intentional grounding
Totally
That completely was a forward pass,
which they threw incomplete to avoid loss of yardage
or to conserve time
I can't believe they're not penalized with the loss of a down
and by having to move the scrimmage line back to the spot of the foul
- Here, have some pizza, sweetie - You know I'm lactose intolerant
I know I just need you to stop talking
- Sheldon, come in - Thank you
I'd like to make a sandwich, but I'm out of bread
There's some in the fridge
You shouldn't keep it in the refrigerator
Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules,
which occurs faster at cool temperatures
On earth, we say "thank you"
How goes the mimesis?
"Mimesis"?
You know
Mimesis
An action in which the mimic takes on the properties
of a specific object or organism
Mimesis
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm attempting to communicate with you
without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you
Let me try again
Have the indigenous fauna
accepted you as one of their own?
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink
Oh, I guess so
Good
Oh, fyi
After I eat my sandwich,
I'm taking Koothrappali's patang kite out for a test run
Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?
I don't want to fly kites, Sheldon We're watching football here
I can see that I was providing you with an alternative
A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances
Look at that
The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag,
indicating he's challenging the ruling on the field
I hope he's right, 'cause if he's not, it'll cost him one of his time-outs
You know, Leonard, honey,
I wouldn't mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon
I'll watch the end of the game There's only three minutes left
Until halftime
This is just half?
- We've been here for hours - You'll be here for a couple more
- You're kidding me - No
Nice meeting all of you
So, yeah, anyway, that's my boyfriend
He is really smart
I really like my saber-toothed cat Thank you
My pleasure
Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender's
and have some pie
I'd like that
This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday
Good I'm glad
Did you see the way she smiled at me?
Fine Go ahead
No This is our day
If you want to chase after her, chase after her
Ah, who am I kidding?
I wouldn't have a shot with a girl like that
Don't put yourself down You're a very attractive man
You think so?
Absolutely It wouldn't kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then,
but you have a certain wiry appeal
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter 'cause she wasn't really smiling at me
Actually, I think she was
- Really? - Yeah
What a douche
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game
It's like the slogan says, "The Physics is theoretical,
but the fun is real"
We must not be playing it right
All right, five
One, two, three, four, five
Oh, wow, look at that
My Department of Defense research grant is renewed
Oh! Great roll!
Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron
and build the large Hadron Collider
Yay
You're a natural at this, Penny
And as the first beta testers, you two'll have quite the edge
when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday
Oh, gee, Sheldon,
I don't think we can play on Sunday
Why not?
Because of the reasons
that Penny will now tell you
Penny?
Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport
There you go-- she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport
And I can't play 'cause I'm going with her-- right?
Um, yeah, if you want
I mean, there may not be room
He's got a lot of stuff-- like guitars and amplifiers
Wait
What are you talking about?
My friend, Justin
Pay attention, Leonard
That's why she can't play on Sunday
Who is this Justin?
Your turn, Leonard I told you about him
No, you didn't Roll the dice, Leonard
Yeah-- my friend from Omaha; plays the guitar
Anyway, he's coming to LA looking for some session work,
so I told him he could just crash on my couch
for a few weeks
Come on, Leonard-- if you roll a six,
Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown
See what I mean when I say the fun is real?
Hang on
Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
He's not "some guy"
He's my friend
So by "friend," do you mean "friend friend,"
"gay friend," or "ex boyfriend
"who you're now platonic with
but still might have a thing for you friend"?
Well, he's definitely not gay
Oh, ho-ho, a definitely not gay musician
sleeping on my girlfriend's couch
Yippee
Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago
But we were never like "going out"
Okay, not to be pedantic, but last I checked
"went out" was in fact the past tense of "going out"--
which I think we all know
is a popular euphemism
for "saw each other naked"
I'll just roll for you
Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?
What was your first clue?
Uh-oh! Industrial accident
You know what?
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot
I'm not talking to you like you're an idiot!
I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic!
"You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser
Lose one turn and a retina"
How is that not talking to me like I'm an idiot?
It's my friend, it's my couch,
and it's my freakin' life!
It's also your roll
You know what? It is your life
If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine
Why don't you just rent
some bun beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?!
Hey, if I want to invite the entire lineup of Lollapalooza
to sleep in my apartment, I will,
and it's none of your business!
Are you listening to yourself?
Do you know how childish you sound right now?
Oh, now I'm a child?
Well, at least I'm not an idiot anymore!
(blender grinding) The two aren't mutually exclusive!
Oh, you are such a--
What the hell is he doing?!
He's drowning us out
He doesn't like fighting
Sheldon, just stop! ok, the fight is over!
Oh, and FYI,
you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas
until you met me!
I heard of 'em!
Didn't know they were a band
(grinding continues)
Sheldon, she's gone
You can turn off the blender
Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
No, we just had a little spat
Look on the bright side
As the result of Penny's forfeit,
you have become the world's first winner of "Research Lab"
Would you like a commemorative snow cone?
* Our whole universe was in a high, dense state *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago*  The Earth began to cool t! *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *
* We built the Wall * We built the pyramids * 
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery*
*hat all started with a big bang *
* Bang! * 
I don't get how she can just announce
that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch
Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car
I don't want to play a game, Sheldon
It's called "Scientists"
Now, I will name three scientists,
then you will put them in order
of the size of their contribution
to their respective fields
To make this game even more compelling,
you must consider only the contribution
of the man to the field,
not the validity of the field itself
For example: Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn
made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy
than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology
Okay, ready to have some fun?
An old boyfriend who's definitely not gay
That's what a guy likes to hear-- "definitely"
All right, I'll start with an easy one:
Um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr
And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
Hint: Madame Curie had her husband to help her
What am I supposed to say?
"Sure, Penny, I'm cool with your old boyfriend
sleeping in your apartment"
"Well, Leonard, it doesn't matter if you're cool or not
"because I'm Penny and I'm pretty
and I can do whatever the hell I want!"
"Oh, I get it!
"You think you're doing me a favor just by
being in a relationship with me!"
"No, no, Leonard! I'm doing you a favor
just by being in the same room as you!"
Leonard! Stop the car!
What?
I can't listen to the two of you fight anymore
Come on, come on, we're late
Calm down We'll make the movie
I believe my alarm is appropriate,
given the situation
The movie starts in 17 minutes,
which means we'll need to make all the lights
on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand,
and preshow urination
Oh, dude, I wish you had said something
before pounded that last Red Bull
SHELDON: Go, go, Power Rangers, go!
Hey
Hey
We're, uh, going to the movies
No, we're not
We're standing in the hallway,
suffering through an awkward encounter
Hang on
They're showing a new digital part of Time Bandits 
You wouldn't want to come, would you?
Not really, no
All right, invitation pointlessly offered,
invitation declined as expected,
everyone's civil, nobody's fighting
Have a nice evening
Just give us a minute
Oh, take all the time you need
So, are we going to talk about last night?
Are you ready to apologize?
No
(imitates buzzer) Wrong answer
But thank you for playing
Oh, come on
This is stupid
Oh, there it is again!
You think I'm stupid!
No, there's a difference
between being stupid and acting stupid
Oh, yeah? well, there's a difference
between being a jerk and being an ass!
No, there isn't!
They're synonyms!
Well, that was rather unpleasant
Yeah, I don't think I need my preshow urination anymore
Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago
I told you not to talk to her, and now look
we're going to be late for the movies
Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183 
Got it
Remember this one?
Spider-Man loses a big fight
and then his girlfriend breaks up with him
Hmm
Want me to get it for you?
It'll help take your mind off things
Hey, guys What's going ?
Oh, we need to kill a couple hours
till the next showing of Time Bandits 
Oh, well,
no problem
I was thinking of closing early and going home,
but let's face it,
that's just a slightly smaller lonely room
filled with comic books
Thanks, Stuart
Let me ask you something
Do you think it's okay for Penny
to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?
No, I mean, she's obviously way out of line
Thank you!
But if she dumps you,
she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning
and you'll have a new girlfriend
when you figure out how to build one
So the only question is: how long until you fold?
I am not going to fold
Well, excuse me, I don't think
Penny's out of line at all
You don't own her
It's like my girl, Beyonce says
"If you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it"
WOLOWITZ: Come on
At the very least,
when she found out Leonard was upset about it,
she should've backed off
You mean like when a guy's upset
because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him
and then doesn't show up
because he's doing a juice fast with his mother?
I didn't know you were upset about that
Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators,
like me saying, "Howard, I am upset"
Okay, sorry
Maybe it means something different in this country
Back in India, it means you're upset with a guy named Howard!
I said I'm sorry
Sorry doesn't make up for the fact
that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy
Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is?
Rice!
Yeah, well, you think I was having fun,
sitting around all night listening to my mother say,
"Have you ever peed so much in your life?"
Oh, my God, you are such a mama's boy
WOLOWITZ: Hey, don't bring my mother into this!
You brought your mother into this!
Stop it, both of you
All this fighting, I might as well
be back with my parents! "Damn it, George,
I told you if you didn't quit drinkin' I'd leave you!"
"Well, I guess that makes you a liar
'Cause I'm drunk as hell and you're still here!"
"Stop yelling!
You're making Sheldon cry!"
"I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry!
That I let you name him Sheldon"
Boy, what got him so upset?
Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon's upset
Oh, thank you very much
Come back soon
With the other half of my tip
(sighs)
Hey, Sheldon
What are you doing here?
This is a restaurant
It's lunchtime
I would think, as a waitress,
you'd be familiar with the paradigm
Is Leonard coming?
No, I believe Leonard is waiting
for you to come crawling back to him and apologize
Well, that's not gonna happen
I assumed that would be your attitude
Hence, my true purpose in coming here
Which is? I want you to crawl back to him and apologize
I'm busy
Excuse me, miss
I'd like to order lunch
Fine What do you want?
I have a few questions
First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?
Yes
Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from?
Are you giving me half of someone else's sandwich,
or do I have to wait
for someone else in the restaurant
to order the other half?
No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich
You can't make a half-sandwich
If it's the half of a whole sandwich,
it's just a small sandwich
Okay, fine, it's soup and a small sandwich
Is that what you want?
Of course not I'll have my usual
Great
Aren't you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
Don't you usually get lemonade?
Yes Do you want lemonade?
Yes Anything else?
Yes-- I want you to apologize to Leonard
I am not going to apologize
I've done nothing wrong
He is completely overreacting
Irrelevant
The disruption in your relationship
is making my life intolerable
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn't about you
I don't follow
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there
Look, Sheldon, I have to go
All right, let's assume, ad argumentum, 
that in this case, Leonard is wrong
Leonard is wrong 
Considering the number of transgressions
you've committed that he's overlooked,
don't you think that, just this once,
you could return the favor?
I'm coming
Good-bye, Sheldon
(sighs)
What do you mean, transgressions I've committed?
Were you under the impression
that Leonard has no complaints about you?
Like what?! Yeah, yeah, I see you
You're making a little check sign in the air
I got it Just hold your horses
What does Leonard complain about?
Your driving
The plethora of stuffed animals on your bed
that stare at him during your amorous activities
Your constant tardiness, your singing
My singing?
That's actually from my list
But Leonard would be a fool if he didn't agree with it
Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me,
why hasn't he just said so?
Because, according to him,
you're oversensitive and have a temper
Oh, really?
Well, then, do me a favor
and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!
And she wonders why she's constantly undertipped
Hey
Oh, good, you're home
I need you to do me a favor
Sure
Go apologize to Penny
What?!
Right now would be good
(loud knocking) PENNY: Leonard!
Although, a few minutes ago would have been better
PENNY: I hear you don't like
my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality
What? Who would tell you something like that?
Why would you tell her something like that?
It doesn't matter why he told me
It's true, isn't it?
Okay, yeah, it's true,
but I can live with that stuff
What I can't live with is you casually informing me
that some guy's going to be staying in your apartment
without even asking me first!
That isn't even your problem!
Your problem is you don't trust me!
Oh, come on
Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don't trust Penny?
Sheldon? Where did he go?
PENNY: Oh, your yelling
must have freaked him out again
Where are you going?!
You just walk away
in the middle of an argument?! No
I'm going to go find your damn roommate
before he hurts himself
trying to cross the street or something!
Why didn't you say so?
Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!
Well, I can't read your mind, Penny!
Really? Why not?
You're so smart, and I'm so dumb!
Raj?
Raj?
Raj?
KOOTHRAPPALI: Stop knocking! It's open!
Please tell my parents that our dark matter research
is at a critical juncture, and I can't come home
for my cousin Sanjay's wedding
MRS KOOTHRAPPALI: Sheldon,
ask our son what we're supposed to say
to Mr and Mrs Cheldry, whose daughter, Lakshmi
is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him
I didn't ask you to set me up with Lakshmi
You should be thanking us!
Yes-- Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled
You have an opportunity to get in good with her
before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up
I don't care!
And why don't you think I can find
a woman for myself?
Because you're 27,
and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law
is that Jewish boy Howard
Ohthat is completely below the belt
Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends
Sheldon?
Howard and I are just friends!
Fine I'll come home for Sanjay's wedding
(sighs)
(shouting): Sheldon?!
(whistling)
What are you doing? He's not a lost dog
Hey, why don't you just let me find him
while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?
The brake might be imaginary,
but that stop sign you just ran wasn't
What stop sign?
Eyes on the road Eyes on the road!
(doorbell rings)
MOTHER: Howard, answer the door!
I'm busy!
WOLOWITZ: I'm busy too
You answer it
MOTHER: I can't!
I'm on the toilet!
WOLOWITZ: For God's sake, I don't need to hear that!
Can't you just say, "I'm busy"?
MOTHER: I said I'm busy,
but that wasn't good enough for you!
WOLOWITZ: You know what?
I hope it's one of those home invasion deals,
And they shove me in the head
MOTHER: Well, if it's a home invader,
don't tell them I'm on the toilet!
There's no one there
You're hearing things, you crazy old lady!
Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?
Yeah, he's, uh, over in the graphic novel section
Built himself a little nest
Thank you
Uh, Penny?
Yeah?
Is everything okay?
What do you mean?
Uh, Sheldon told me
you and Leonard were having a fight?
Oh, yeah, kind of
It's-It's no big thing
Oh, good, good
I love you
I'm not leaving until you talk to me
All right, what's going on?
It's a little hard to explain He does this thing
where he pretends he's in an alternate
dimension that occupies the same physical space we're in,
but he can't perceive us
Don't flatter yourself
I'm just ignoring you
Come on, Sheldon, let's go home
Look, we're done fighting
I've heard that before
But then, the next thing you know,
I'm hiding in my bedroom,
blaring a Richard Feinman lecture
while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her
if she put ground glass in my dad's meatloaf
And my dad's
on the roof skeet-shooting
her Franklin Mint collectible plates
There's going to no more shouting
and no skeet-shooting
Really?
Where's your friend Justin going to sleep?
Yeah where's he gonna sleep?
Oh, my God, would you let this go?!
STUART: I'd let it go
Why should I let it go?
Why don't you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep?!
(robot playing ominous music)
Oh, for God's sakes
(turns robot off)
So, you have childhood issues
We all have childhood issues
At some point, you just need to grow up and get past them
ROBOT: Fire! Fire!
(robot firing blasters)
Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please?
Again! Fire! Fire! Let justLook
(robot shouting)
(turns robot off)
Sheldon, please, try and understand
Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship,
and occasionally, we're going to fight
But no matter what happens
between us, we will always love you
Right, Leonard?
Always is a long time
Sure Always
You know, how about we buy you this robot,
and then we all go home?
I want that one
Okay, you can have that one
Oh, come on, he's just going to play with it twice,
and then it'll end up in his closet with all the other junk
Buy him the robot, Leonard
Can I get this comic book, too?
(baby talk): Yes, you can
(sighs)
We meet again
So what did Justin say when you told him
he couldn't sleep on your couch?
He's a musician
He'll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to
I should have asked for much more
than a comic book and a robot

How much time do we have?
Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes
To onset of meteor shower
Okay, our position is 3448 degrees north,
11831 west
That means the azimuth
Should be
16822 degrees relative to magnetic north
With an elevation of 4993
Anything yet?
Uh, we have a signal, but there's no frame lock
Ha How about now? - We did it
We have the west coast feed of HBO
Ooh, Real Sex 
Big deal Every time I watch that show

All right, let's see what's on the east coast feed
Oh, hey Dune 
Not a great movie,
But look at that beautiful desert
Too bad Sheldon couldn't come with us
Oh it's just not the same without him
Oh, this sucks I'm switching back to Real Sex 
Sheldon's log star date 633453
While my colleagues are off
Observing the Leonid meteor shower,
I have remained behind to complete my paper
On the decays of highly excited massive string states
Although my research is going well
I do miss the warmth of human companionship
Hahaha
And good evening to you, Siam Palace
This is Sheldon Cooper
Yeah, I'm going to be dining alone this evening,
So I'll be reducing my usual order
I'd like to start with one quarter
Of the assorted appetizers plate
And, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two
Oh, for heaven's sake
In the mid-18th century,
King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire
Amongst the colonial powers of Europe
In order to preserve his throne
Surely, you, his cultural descendant,
Can handle pad Thai and dumplings
Sheldon help!
I need to go-- but you keep in mind
That my sharply worded comments
On yelpCom recently took down a local muffin store
Penny Penny Penny
Come in! Hurry!
Penny?
I'm back here
Penny Penny Penny
Oh, for god's sakes, I'm in the bathroom!
Shall I come back at a better time?
Get in here! Hurry!
Don't you dare knock
Hello
I slipped in the shower,
And I think I dislocated my shoulder
Not surprising
You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers
To allow for purchase on a surface
With a low coefficient of static friction
What?
Tubs are slippery
I know I slipped
I have a series of whimsical duck stickers
On the bottom of my tub
Yeah, okay, whatever
Will you just turn the water off and help me up?
They're holding umbrellas
what?
The ducks in my tub
Uh-huh
They're whimsical because ducks have neither the need for
Nor the ability to use umbrellas
Oh, my god I got to go to the emergency room
Well, assuming you're correct that your right humerus
Is no longer seated in the glenoid socket,
I would certainly think so Okay, can you drive me?
I don't drive
Well, I can't drive!
Well, it seems we've reached an impasse
Ow
I could call you a cab or an ambulance No, no, no
I can't wait that long
You got to help me, please
All right Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper
Ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress
No one's saying that Let's go
Well, it does seem rather ironic
That for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks,
We both might die in a fiery car crash
I wish Penny didn't for want didn't have to work
She loves camping
Yeah, that would have been great
You and Penny having sex in the tent
While I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus
Okay, the best I can tell,
There are eight other camp-sites nearby
Mostly science nerds like us,
But just over yon ridge are two
Not unattractive middle school teachers
Who reek of desperation
Wow Wonderful
How old are they? Oh I don't know 50, 55
Oh, menopause
Nature's birth control
Come on
You guys can't be that hard up
I am Yeah, me, too
Look-- they gave me home-made cookies of course, they did
That's what grandmothers do
So, what are we waiting for?
Relax
I said we'd stop by a little later
After they have their nap
Good idea
They'll be refreshed
Cookie?
Yeah Thank you
Not bad
Yeah, very tasty
Well, so tell me more about these teachers
Not much to tell
They had a VW Microbus
And were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts
Huh
Mmm
Good cookies
I see no organizational system in here whatsoever
Which panties do you wear on Mondays?
I don't need panties
I just need shorts and a shirt
My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants
In case one is in an accident
One was already in an accident
That doesn't mean one won't be in another,
Especially if I'm driving
Clothes, Sheldon
I need clothes! Okay
Here
Seriously? Those shorts with that top?
All right
No
No
Oh, that's cute
We should have you checked for a concussion
okay
Now, you got to help me put these on
All right But don't look
Don't look? I don't want you to see me naked
Oh
Well, that's understandable
You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking
Is well established in heroic mythology
Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa,
Orpheus and Eurydi Yeah, great
They always look
It never ends well
Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve
Ok
Is that my arm?
It doesn't feel like an arm
Then, maybe you should let it go
All righty
Stars are pretty, aren't they?
Up above the world so high,
Like little diamonds in the sky
That's beautiful, dude
You should You should write that down
Before someone steals it
- So, when do the meteors get here? - The meteors don't get here
The earth is moving into their path
I can feel it
I can feel the earth moving
It's moving too fast
Raj, slow it down
Okay, how's that?
Better Thanks
Stars are pretty, aren't they?
What's so funny?
It's your American accent
Everything you say sounds stupid
"stars are pretty, aren't they?"
For the record, I should let you know
This is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle
You have your learner's permit, right?
Yes, and I have logged
A considerable number of hours on a simulator
- Good - Didn't work out well
All right, can we please go? One moment
According to my driver's ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted
When a portion of the is driver's door handle
Is visible in the lower right corner
There's the handle
Oh, no, too far
Bringing it back
Optimized
Now, where is the switch
To adjust the passenger side mirror?
It's right there
Where is the passenger side mirror?
In a parking lot in Hollywood
- Now, can we please go? - Yes As soon as I adjust my seat
Whee!
Oh, dear
I'm going to have start again
If I could speak the language of rabbits,
They would be amazed, and I would be their king
I hate my name
It has "nerd" in it
Len-nerd
I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie
I would be kind to my rabbit subjects
At first
You know what's a cool name?
Angelo
That has angel and jell-o in it
It was my Uncle Murray's funeral
We were all back at my Aunt Barbara's house
Our eyes locked over the pickled herring
We never meant for it to happen
One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France,
But the rabbits-- they hate me and don't come
I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world
And make them watch
People could call me Angie
Yo, Angie, how's it goin'?
To this day, I can't look at pickled herring without being aroused That is a shame
oh! Cousin Jeanie
Could you please drive a little faster?
Oh, I think we're going sufficiently fast
What's that?
Nothing The engine does that sometimes
It can't be nothing
The check engine light is on
We need to find a service station
No The light has been on since I bought the car
All the more reason
To consult with a mechanic before it explodes
It's not going to explode
Just keep driving
Warp speed ahead, Mr Spock
Mr Spock did not pilot the Enterprise 
He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that
If he ever saw the Enterprise's check engine light blinking, 
He would pull the ship over immediately
Oh, god, I'm gonna lose the arm
Oh, oh, red light
Release accelerator
And slowly apply the brake
Nailed it
While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?
What?
Why do you have the Chinese character for soup
Tattooed on your right buttock?
It's not soup
It's courage
No, it isn't
But I suppose it does take courage
To demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup
How did you see it?
You said you wouldn't look
Sorry
As I told you, the hero always peeks
Anything?
No That was the last pudding cup
No!
What about Slim Jim's?
That's what he used to eat his pudding, remember? Right! That was so good!
Sweety and meaty at the same time
Wait Wait, wait So you're saying
We're out of food?
The only thing in here are blue ice packs
I know they're poison,
But they look like big, yummy otter pops
Oh, god, I am so hungry
Me, too
Check and see if we have any more pudding
All right, there's no need to bark at me
According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk,
You'll be seen after the man
who claims to be having a heart attack,
But appears to be well enough
To play Doodle Jump on his iphone
We have to fill these out
"describe illness or injury"
I dislocated my shoulder
All right
And how did the accident occur?
You ready know that
"cause of accident"
"lack of adhesive ducks"
Okay, medical history
"Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?"
No Kidney disease?
No Migraines?
Getting one
"Are you currently pregnant?" no
Are you sure?
You look a bit puffy
Change migraine to yes
"When was your last menstrual period?"
Oh Next question
I'll put, "in progress"
Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders
"list all major behavioural diagnoses,
"eg Depression, anxiety, etcetera"
Oh, my god, what the hell does this have
to do with my stupid shoulder?!
"episodes of sub psychotic rage"
Ass
"possible tourette's"
All right "moles, lesions or other skin conditions"
"soup tattoo on right buttock"
Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look,
I am scared and in a lot of pain
Could you please just take a break from being you and try being--
I don't know-- comforting?
I'm sorry
There, there
Every thing's going to be fine
Sheldon's here
Thanks
That's much better
Oh, I'm so hungry!
Will you shut up?
We're all hungry
Okay, our objective is
The boy scout camp-site to the east
Easy target
Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos
What kind of score we looking at?
Hot dogs, buns, s'mores
I mean, it's a freaking 7-11
All right,
Everyone grab flash lights
Oh, my god, could it be?
Yes!
My mother put an "I love you" brisket in my backpack
Quick, get forks
You don't need forks
It's so tender, it falls apart in your hands
He's right
I feel like we're forgetting something important
Me, too But what?
Maybe a Tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?
Yes! Yes!
Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication
And a muscle relaxer,
So, uh, don't operate heavy machinery
Try not to choke on your own drool
Wait You have
To help me get into bed
Sheldon has to get me into bed
Bet you never thought I'd say that
Yes
The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds
You know, people think you're this weird robot man
Who's so annoying all the time, and you totally are
But then it's like that movie Wall-e at the end 
You're so full of love,
And you can save a plant
And get fat people out of the floaty chairs
That's a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it
Sing "Soft Kitty" to me
"Soft Kitty" is for when you're sick
You're not sick
Injured and drugged is a kind of sick
soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur
Wait, wait
Let's sing it as a round
I'll start
soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur
I'll start over
soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur
soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur
happy kitty, sleepy kitty
happy kitty, sleepy kitty
happy kitty, purr, purr, purr
purr, purr, purr

And the next morning when he woke up,
He rolled over and realized
duh-duh-duh!
She was his cousin
That's still not funny
That's still not funny
And she was my second cousin
And she was my second cousin
You're a real douche
Who cares? You slept with your cousin

So two years later, there's a knock on the door
{\pos(192,220)}Guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says,
{\pos(192,220)}"What the heck was all that about?"
I don't really get it
Well, see, it took two years for the snail to
Not important
- Can I ask you a question? - Sure
Where do you think this is going?
{\pos(192,220)}To be honest, I was hoping at least second base
You're so funny
You're like a stand-up comedian
{\pos(192,220)}A Jewish stand-up comedian, that'd be new
{\pos(192,220)}Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish
No, I was just never mind
{\pos(192,220)}Look, Howard, this is our third date and
we both know what that means
We do?
Sex
You're kidding
{\pos(192,220)}But I need to know whether you're looking
{\pos(192,220)}for a relationship or a one-night stand
Okay, just to be clear:
there's only one correct answer, right?
It's not like "chicken or fish" on an airplane?
Maybe you need to think about it a little
You know, it's not unheard of
for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship
Call me when you figure it out
Three dates means sex?
Who knew?
Greetings, homies
Homette
Why are you back from your date so early?
In romance, as in show business,
always leave them wanting more
What exactly does that mean?
He struck out
Hey, Leonard, check this out
Leonard, she's doing it again
I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food
No
It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it
from the containers without regard
for its equitable distribution
This is essentially why you have famine in India
You want me to put it back?
Leonard
It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon
What's up, my nerdizzles?
Raj, Sheldon,
I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette
Hello Leonard, Penny,
you know my girlfriend Bernadette
Yeah Hey
Bernadette, say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles
I don't think I can
I don't have Howard's street cred
I hope it's all right-
I told my girlfriend Bernadette
she could join us for dinner
Sure The more, the merrier
Wa- no, that's a false equivalency
More does not equal merry
If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now,
would we be celebrating?
No, we'd be suffocating
Sheldon
Don't "Sheldon" me
We ordered for five people, not six
Oh, come on, it's fine
We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style
Oh, sure And while we're at it,
why don't we put our hands behind our backs,
have an old-fashioned eating contest?
Relax, it'll be fine
Sit down, you guys
No! No! No!
What?!
Oh, yeah, you can't sit there
Why not?
That's where Sheldon sits
He can't sit somewhere else?
No, no, no- you see, in the winter,
that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm,
yet not so close that he sweats
In the summer, it's directly in the path of
a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there
It faces the television
at an angle that isn't direct,
so he can still talk to everybody,
yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted
Perhaps there's hope for you after all
Ooh, I love your shoes
Oh, thanks
They are cute, aren't they?
Where'd you get them? Shoes for Less
I've been meaning to go over there
Oh, great selection, great prices
My mother was right Hell is real
Come on, Sheldon
Let the womenfolk chat
Womenfolk?
Gals?
Chicks?
Utero-Americans?
Just eat your dinner
Don't take him too seriously
A lot of what he says is intended as humor
Yeah, well, I don't think it's very funny
Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh
Howard, never let her go
So, Leonard, Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests of quantum mechanics
I am
Are you interested in physics?
Oh, I find it fascinating
If I hadn't gone into microbiology,
I probably would have gone into physics
Or ice dancing
Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point
Right now, we're testing the phase shift
due to an electric potential
That's amazing
SHELDON Yes
Leonard's work is nearly as amazing
as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels
While I appreciate the "Oh, snap,"
I'm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear
Are you going to try
to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?
Yes, I am
You want to see a simulation on my laptop?
Oh, yeah, show me
In microbiology, the most exciting thing
I get to work with is yeast
Howard?
Yeah?
Your shoes are delightful
Where did you get them?
What?
Bazinga I don't care
Ha! Eat my dust,
racially stereotypical plumber
That's not fair
I got stuck behind a tree
And a cow and a penguin
Face it, dude,
whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car,
you can't drive
Just need a little more practice
What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie
who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart
Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?
It's not about shoes, is it?
I don't think I could go through that again
It's not about shoes
Then speak
Um, actually, can we do it in private?
All right
Go away
I agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy
Thanks, Raj
Okay, so here's the thing:
I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?
A little physics?
There's no such thing
Physics encompasses the entire universe,
from quantum particles to supernovas,
from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies
Yeah, okay, cool
I don't need the PBS special
I just want to know enough
so I can talk to Leonard about his job
You know, like Bernadette does
Why can't Leonard teach you?
'Cause I want to surprise him
Can't you surprise him in some other way?
For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback
if you cleaned your apartment
Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me
Penny,
this would be a massive undertaking,
and my time is both limited and valuable
You're sitting here playing video games all day
Okay, point
What sort of foundation do you have?
Did you take any science classes in school?
Sure I did the one with the frogs
The one with the frogs
Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool
A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer
I'm sorry, Penny
I don't think so
Oh, come on!
A smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge
You can make it like an experiment
Interesting
I suppose if someone could teach sign language
to KoKo the gorilla
I could teach you some rudimentary physics
Great!
It's a little insulting, but great
I'll be KoKo
Not likely
KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words,
not one of which had anything to do with shoes
Hey, fellas
This is my girlfriend Bernadette
My girlfriend Bernadette
Who are all those people?
Have no idea
Hey, Leonard
Hi Hey, look,
it's Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette
Thought I'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines
He doesn't mean salt mines
He means where he works
Yeah, no, I got it
So, how's your experiment going?
Ah, terrific
We're getting the electron accelerator set up
We should be ready to go day after tomorrow
Boy, I'd love to see that
You're welcome to come
Really? Oh, that'd be great
How exciting is that?
Like Hanukkah in July
Do they have that?
No
Oh
You got me again
This isn't non-fat yogurt
This is fatty fat fat
Excuse me
Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?
Sure Thanks, honey
All right, what is your deal?
Excuse me?
Inviting my girlfriend
to come see your electron accelerator?
Yeah? So?
Wow!
You really are a piece of work
It's not enough
you get the prom queen, you have to get
the head of the decorating committee, too?
What are you talking about?
Don't play innocent with me
I practically invented
using fancy lab equipment to seduce women
Has it ever worked?
Not so far, but that's not the point!
Howard, relax
I'm not interested in your girlfriend
I hope not
Because you don't want to mess with me
I'm crazy
I believe you
Research journal, entry one
I'm about to embark on one of
the great challenges of my scientific career:
teaching Penny physics
I'm calling it Project Gorilla
Hey, Sheldon
Come in Take a seat
Subject has arrived
I've extended a friendly casual greeting
Ready to get started?
One moment
Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic
Apparently, ignorance is bliss
All right, let us begin
Where's your notebook?
Um, I don't have one
How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
I have to take notes?
How else are you gonna study for the tests?
There's gonna be a test?
Test-sss
Here
It's college-ruled
I hope that's not too intimidating
Thank you
You're welcome
Now, Introduction to Physics
What is physics?
Physics comes from the ancient Greek word "physika "
It's at this point that you'll want to start taking notes
"Physika" means the science of natural things
And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins
Ancient Greece?! Hush
If you have questions,
raise your hand
It's a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC
You've finished your shopping at the local market, or agora
and you look up at the night sky
There you notice some of the stars seem to move,
so you name them "planetes," or "wanderer "
Yes, Penny?
Um, does this have anything to do
with Leonard's work?
This is the beginning of a 2,600-year journey
we're going to take together
from the ancient Greeks
through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr
to Erwin Schrodinger
to the Dutch researchers
that Leonard is currently ripping off
2,600 years?
Yeah, give or take
As I was saying, it's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece
Yes, Penny?
I have to go to the bathroom
Can't you hold it?
Not for 2,600 years
Project Gorilla, entry two
I am exhausted
Howard? Huh?
It unhooks in the front
Oh, that explains a lot
Howard, I'm home!
Of course
Senior fitness was cancelled
It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike
I'm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel
That's great, Ma!
What's great about an 80-year-old Armenian man
with half his chin scraped off?!
I guess I should go
No, no, don't move
Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?
Lamb stew? I'd have to go to the supermarket
Please?
I got a real hankering
Oh, I can't say no to my little tushy face
I'll be back soon
Thanks, Ma
Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?
Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!
You're right! When you're right, you're right!
What if they're out of the Le Seur?
Then get the regular!
All right! You don't have to yell!
Sorry about that
Let me just put that on vibrate
I'm already on vibrate
You know, that one I got
Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?
Uh, what do you mean?
He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow
it might weird you out
Really? He said that?
You're not jealous of Leonard, are you?
Me? No
I may have mentioned that it's a little inappropriate
to be asking another man's girlfriend to his experiment
without first discussing it with said man
Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?
I didn't say anything like that
I said Leonard has to ask my permission
Come on, I don't want to eat lamb stew with my mother
Damn, I was this close on the bra
Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong
and force was not necessary to maintain motion
So let's plug in our 98 meters per second squared
as "A" and we get
force- Earth gravity- equals mass times 98 meters
per second per second
So we can see that "ma" equals "mg"
and what do we know from this?
Uh, we know that
Newton was a really smart cookie
Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?
No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts
Don't write that down! Sorry
Now, if "ma" equals "mg," what does that imply?
I don't know
How can you not know?
I just told you
Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
Hey! You don't have to be so mean!
I'm sorry
Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
No, you just suck at teaching Really?
Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?
Oh, God
Sheldon, I'm trying to understand,
but you're going too fast
Can you just back up a little bit?
All right
It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece
Not that far back!
Okay!
At what point did you begin to feel lost?
I don't know
Where were we looking up at the night sky?
Greece Damn it!
There's no need to get frustrated
People learn at different rates
Unlike objects
falling in a vacuum, which?
"ma" equals "mg"?
Squared?
No
Aristotle?
No
Five?
Oh!
Then I don't know
Why are you crying?
Because I'm stupid!
That's no reason to cry
One cries because one is sad
For example, I cry because others are stupid
and it makes me sad
Okay, look, can we just please forget about
all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?
All right
Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles
move the way they do
Really? That's it?
Well, that doesn't sound so complicated
It's not
That's why Leonard does it
Okay, I just have one question
What exactly are sub-atomic particles?
A good question
Thank you
And to answer it, we first must
ask ourselves: "What is physics?"
Oh, balls
It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece
Okay, I got a bone to pick with you
What did I do now?
I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me
What?!
We were completely naked, about to devour each other when,
you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you
You do have a problem with her hanging out with me
Yeah, but that's not what you tell her
What was I supposed to tell her?
I don't know; something that doesn't make me come off
as a petty, jealous douche
And what would that be?
Come on, do I have to think of everything?
Hey, Leonard
Am I too late to see the experiment?
Oh, hi Hi
What are you doing here?
Same thing you're doing here
I came to see Leonard's experiment
No, you didn't
You said Leonard's experiment was stupid
You told her my experiment was stupid?
I was just repeating what Sheldon said
Let's not get off topic
Bernadette, I need to apologize
I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with
Should I, um, leave you two alone?
No, Leonard, you should hear this
Okay, good, 'cause I wasn't really gonna go
Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but
the truth is I'm not
We're shocked
Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys
Or loud noises, clowns and nuns
But I now realize how foolish that is
He had a panic attack once
when he got his head stuck in a sweater
It was a full turtleneck
Why aren't you helping me?
I don't know
Maybe because I'm crazy?!
Bernadette, please, I'm asking you to give me another chance
What do you think, Leonard?
Should I give him another chance?
It's up to you
He didn't call your experiment stupid
Come here, tushy face
"Tushy face "
Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment
The interference pattern was so cool
when the electron beam was on
Glad you enjoyed it
Most people aren't that interested in what I do
Actually, that's not true, Leonard
In fact, recently I've been thinking that
given the parameters of your experiment,
the transport of electrons through the aperture
of the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different
than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands
Their observed phase shift
in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring
already conclusively demonstrated
the electric analogue
of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect
That's it That's all I know
Oh, wait!
Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts,
not the scientist
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Oh, I always tear up
when the Grinch's heart grows three sizes
Tears seem appropriate
Enlargement of the heart muscle,
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease
which could lead to congestive heart failure
You really didn't like it, Sheldon?
No, on the contrary
I found the Grinch to be a relatable,
engaging character
And I was really
with him right up to the point
that he succumbed to social convention
and returned the presents and saved Christmas
What a buzz kill that was
When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun
Excuse me,
but the sun is essential for all life on Earth
Frosty is merely
a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat
A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account
I just love decorating the Christmas tree HELP YOU FIND THE PERFECT GIFT
It makes me feel like a little girl again
We didn't have a tree when I was growing up
Really? Why not?
Mmm, in my family,
holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied
for their anthropological and psychological implications
on human society
Oh, sounds festive
Did you at least give presents?
Mmm, in a way
We presented papers
And then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other
Sheldon, what about you?
Did you have a Christmas tree?
Oh, yes
We had a tree, we had a manger,
we had an inflatable Santa Claus
with plastic reindeer on the front lawn
And to make things even
more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house
they induced neighborhood-wide seizures
So I take it you don't want to help us trim the tree
I do not
But if you insist
on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home
I would request that you add this
What is it?
You're kidding, right?
It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton
Oh, sure, sure
Very Christmasy
Wait, excuse me, but it's much
more "Christmasy" than anything you've put on the tree
Here we go
December 25, 1642,
Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born
Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born
in the summer-- His birthday was moved
to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday
that celebrated the winter solstice
with lit fires and slaughtered goats
Which, frankly,
sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother
followed by a fruitcake
Merry Newton-mas, everyone
I sense that's not sincere, although I have no idea why
No, it's fine Look, Sir Issac can go
right next to this little candy cane
No Isaac goes at the top of the tree
No, he doesn't
I understand
You dispute Newton's claim that he invented calculus
and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top
Yeah, you got me
I'm a Leibniz man
Well, perhaps when your mother gets here,
she'll talk some sense into you
What?
Your-your mother's coming? When?
Tomorrow
When were you going to tell me?
Um tomorrow?
Why were you keeping this a secret?
Well, I just-- I thought
If I can interject here,
obviously Leonard is concerned
that his mother won't approve of you as his mate
Why wouldn't she approve of me?
I'm adorable
You are, it's just
If I can interject again
Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family,
who have all chosen high-achieving partners
He probably feels
that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed
with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement
is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu
Hey, it's a big menu
There's two pages just for desserts
I know
And those specials-- they change every day
Okay, you know what? It's lame when I say it
It's just ridiculous when you pile on Okay
Sorry
So what did she say when you told her we were going out?
You didn't tell her we were going out, did you?
Why not?
Leonard
I'm no expert on meditation,
but if you're trying to calm yourself down,
I believe the word is "Om"
It was so nice of you
to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up
No trouble at all
I drove, Mother
I'm driving now
Yes, dear Mommy's proud
I've been meaning to thank you
for your notes on my paper
disproving quantum brain dynamic theory
My pleasure
For a non-physicist,
you have a remarkable grasp
of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules
could not possibly form a Bose condensate
Wait, wait, wait
When did you send my mom notes on a paper?
August 16
Right after her carpal tunnel surgery
Oh, did I thank you for the flowers? You did
I don't really like flowers
Neither do I, but it's the social convention
It is, isn't it?
Wait, wait, wait You had surgery?
Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers
No, I heard that
Then what was all that "wait, wait, wait" about?
I just don't understand
why he knows more about your life than I do
Well, I would assume it's because Sheldon
and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect,
while you avoid me,
due to unresolved childhood issues
It's what we think
caused your narcissistic personality disorder
We discussed it at length during our last video chat
Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling
Yes, but we are on the subject,
so I'm obliged to ask
Leonard, how are you?
Fine, Mom How are you?
Mmm, menopausal
Now I'm less fine
Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?
No
Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?
My bad
I did send a gift from both of us
She's a remarkable girl
The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey
and a two-time Olympic bronze medalist
You must be very happy
Why? I'm not marrying her
So, how about you?
Are you seeing anyone interesting?
Well, I'm not sure about interesting, but
Not the time, Sheldon
Very well
Shall we switch topics
to Isaac Newton v Gottfried Leibniz?
It's all right, Sheldon
I will just pretend
that Leonard's not withholding information
Although, I will point out, Leonard,
that I am a trained psychiatrist
and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioral tics
that accompanied your learning to masturbate
Isn't she brilliant, Leonard?
How I envy you
So, Howard,
have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage
to express your latent homosexual feelings
toward one another?
What? No
Why not?
Because we don't have latent homosexual feelings
toward one another
I see
No, really
I have a girlfriend now
And where is she this evening?
She had to go out of town
Her grandmother died
I see
Her grandmother died
Honest to God
Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend
I don't know what you're talking about
What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about?
Tell her I have a girlfriend!
All right
He "has" a "girlfriend"
Her name is Bernadette She's working as a waitress,
but she's going to school to be a microbiologist
Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately
you stick to this construct,
the more you're hurting your partner
Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?
Hi Sorry I'm late
Oh, glad you're here Uh, sit down
I'll get you a plate
Mom, you remember Penny
Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress
with the unresolved father issues
Has he finally come to terms
with his little slugger growing breasts?
Well, he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas,
so I'm going to say no
If it helps, we're all good with your breasts
Classic overcompensation
Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard,
that reminds me, I'm divorcing your father
What?!
Yes He was cheating on me
No! Yes, with some waitress
from the university cafeteria
Can you believe it?
A waitress?
Oh, no offense, dear
No, it sounded like a compliment
When did this happen?
Mmm, well, let's see
Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard's father?
September 22
Oh, yes, that's right
The weekend after Leonard's dog died
Mitzy's dead?!
She was old and blind, Leonard
What choice did we have?
I don't believe this
Why am I the last to know?!
Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who's getting a divorce,
Mitzy is the one who is dead
Why are you the one making a fuss?
You're right
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry
I'm way out of line!
So, Penny, what's new in your life?
Nothing
Not a damn thing
Thank you for driving me back to my hotel
Oh, it's not a problem
I was going to ask Leonard to do it,
but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable
and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery
No, you do not
Your "check engine" light is on
Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that
So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce
Oh, not at all
But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle
that's not subjected to regular maintenance
Come on, I mean, you're not upset
that your marriage is over?
Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger,
but that's the natural reaction of the limbic system
to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch
Sure, sure
Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact
that I haven't had intercourse with him in eight years
Eight years?
Oh, that's nothing
I've been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982
Yikes
What's so funny?
That's exactly what I say during orgasms: "Yikes"
You know what? I could use a drink
Do you want to stop for a drink?
Oh, I don't drink I do, I'll teach you
Leonard?
Leonard?
Leonard?
What is it?
I made tea
I don't want tea
I didn't make tea for you
This is my tea
Then why are you telling me?
It's a conversation starter
That's a lousy conversation starter
Oh, is it? We're conversing
Checkmate
What do you want, Sheldon?
What I want is to be departing the starship Enterprise
in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule
known as Sheldon Alpha Five
I want that too
Why are you here?
To comfort you, of course
No, that's not going to work at all
I'll comfort you from over here
Leonard, what you're experiencing
is a classic Jungian crisis
in which the aging individual mourns the loss
of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit
Thank you, that's very comforting
That's not the comforting part
It's not?
No, no
The comforting part is that the Germans
have a term for what you're feeling
Weltschmerz
It means
the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is
to a hypothetical, idealized world
You're right, I do feel better
Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people
Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family
has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family
You're my surrogate family?
If it's any consolation, I'm not happy about it either
Good night
Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once
Yikes
I've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003
Another round for me and my homegirl
I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities
As long as you don't feel it
running down your pants, you're fine
Oh, that is fascinating
I'm noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions
For example,
I'm seriously considering asking that busboy
to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake
What do you think?
Well, we are known for our cheesecake
Hit us again Yes
If a little is good, more must be better
Hey, Bev, guess what? What?
I'm sleeping with your son
Really? Which one?
The one from whom I live across the hall from
Well, that's convenient
How did his penis turn out?
Oh, Beverly, I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother
about his penis Oh, fair enough
What can you tell me, if anything,
about that busboy's penis?
actually, I've only had the cheesecake
One more time
You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating
Really?
Well, that means he's either
embarrassed about the relationship
or he doesn't care enough about his mother
to tell her he's in one
Either way, one of us should be insulted
Well, let's go find out who
You go get a taxi
I'm gonna slip my business card
into that busboy's back pocket,
cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so
Leonard?
Sonny boy!
Get out here!
Your mommy wants to talk to you!
What the hell is going on?
: You're in trouble
Why didn't you tell me you were tapping my homegirl?
Did I say that right?
Yeah, not bad, not bad
Are you guys drunk?
Well, I hope so
Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco?
Now, how could you not tell me
you were in a relationship
with this lovely, charming young woman?
Oh, thank you You're welcome
Is it because she's uneducated,
trapped in a menial service position?
What the hell happened to "lovely and charming"?
How come you didn't tell me
that you and Father were getting a divorce?
How come you didn't tell me you had surgery?
How come you didn't tell me my dog died?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
What I hear you saying
is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship
I do
There It's late
Now, go to bed
I'm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart
That's the Del Taco
Why is Leonard softly banging his head
against his bedroom door?
Speaking of warm feelings-- come here
No, I'd rather have the busboy
Thank you for taking me to the airport
You're very welcome
Once again, I'm driving
I'm right here
Please, I am very hungover
and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval
Sheldon, I do hope you'll forgive me
for my inappropriate behavior last night
I don't blame you
You were intoxicated
Thank you
I blame Penny
I blame Penny, too
Bad Penny
Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
What inappropriate behavior?
I think it's best that you not know
Agreed Agreed
What the hell agreed
And I want you to take very good care of this young woman
Oh, thank you, Beverly
You're welcome
She doesn't have much in the way of career prospects
Don't make her responsible for her own orgasms as well
Mother, remember when I was complaining
that you don't communicate with me enough?
Yes, dear - I'm over it

Look at us Getting ready for a double date
with actual women who publicly acknowledge
they're our girlfriends
Yes, actual women are the best
I don't understand
What other kind of women are there?
Howard, artificial women are your department
You want to take this?
No, it would just freak him out
Listen, before we leave,
I should warn you, I'm a passionate man
and I tend towards public displays of affection
What are you trying to tell me, Howard?
There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant,
and I don't want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable,
so it would help if you and Penny made out, too
Don't worry
We're planning to have sex right on the salad bar
Namaste, white people 
Good news!
I rented us the fou r-hour edition of Watchmen 
Got it Seen it
Detailed analysis posted online
Well, then what are we going to do tonight?
Uh, sorry, Raj
Howard and I are going out to dinner
with Penny and Bernadette Yeah
No more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard
These broncos have been saddled
How did we get actual women? 
Great
They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?
It is great, isn't it?
We have a wonderful evening ahead of us We do?
Oh, yes I just discovered I don't have
enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition,
so you and I are going to perform a full backup,
reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems
I don't want to do that
All right
Well, I'm going to perform full backup,
reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems
What about me?
Well, I understand
there are several types of artificial women
Maybe you should look into that

Dude, there's so many cool things
we could be doing tonight Look
At the Glendale Galleria,
"Put on your best zoot suit,
"it's a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy's
5:00 pm to 9 pm"
Huh? Huh?
A salute to zoot
Sounds like a hoot
I'm sorry, Raj,
I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight
Much less one that's linked to race riots in the 1940s
Race riots?
The zoot suit riots
Oh
I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale
Well, then why don't we just go to the galleria and walk around?
But I don't need anything at the Galleria
Do you need anything at the Galleria?
No We would just walk around and see what's what
That's a semantically null sentence
Okay, well, how about this?
From the university Web site:
00 pm to 10:00 pm , Norton Hall Multipurpose Room,
"mixer for grad students and faculty
"of the science and humanities departments
"Whether you split atoms or infinitives,
this is the place to be"
Well, that's certainly amusing, but
I have no interest
Come on, Sheldon,
the world is filled with people doing things outside
Let's go outside
Outside is good
If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years
trying to perfect inside?
I don't know, it's a marketing scheme
Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,
virile visitor from a foreign land
and I need to strut my stuff
Let me offer you a compromise
Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery,
I use my imagination
Oh, boy
One of my favorite places
to visit is the two-dimensional world
described in Edwin Abbott's mathematical fantasy,
"Flatland"
I don't want to go to Flatland
You're only saying that because you haven't been there
I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space
and can only perceive the edges of other objects
Oy
Is that you, Raj?
I don't recognize your edge
Sheldon, I'm begging you
I want to go to this mixer, and I don't want to go alone
Well, you're in luck
There's a mixer here in Flatland
Oh, look, there's a sexually attractive line segment
You should chat her up
What? Tell her you're a circle
Flatland gals are all hot for circles
I hope you're hungry, Bernadette
We're going to a terrific restaurant
Oh, yeah, I'm starved
When you spend all day in a bio-lab,
watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents,
it really works up an appetite
Flesh-eating bacteria
And yet, I still want to kiss this woman
What does that tell you?
That you'd be willing to die a horrible death
on the off-chance you'd get to second base?
Oh, we're way past second base
Right, Howard?
Well, we kind of disagree
about what the bases are
How's your work going, Penny?
Any acting jobs?
Well, the last big thing I did was this production
of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley 
But I think things might be turning around pretty soon
Great How come?
Well, promise you won't make fun of me
Of course, I would never make fun of you
Okay
Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair,
I'm going to get a national commercial
Wh Seriously?
You're getting career advice from a psychic?
Good job not making fun of her
She's not one of those phonies, okay
She wrote a book and has her own Web site
Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?
They don't let just anyone have a Web site
Why are you being such a jerk?
You're surprised?
Your psychic tell you I was going to be a jerk?
Bite me
Come on, Penny
Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?
We're gonna make out back here
I'm sliding into third
Thanks for coming with me
Thanks for giving me
your limited edition Green Lantern lantern 
Did you really have to bring it in with you?
What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
Come on, let's get a drink I don't drink
Yeah, well I do
And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, 
I drink a lot
I'll have a screwdriver, please
Don't be chintzy with the screw
I would like a root beer float
Sheldon, they don't have ice cream
They don't?
Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly
on the definition of "party"
He'll have a Shirley Temple
And don't be chintzy with the Shirley
Okay,
let's check out the females
All right
There's a female
That's Professor Wilkinson's wife
She's like 80 years old
But she's female
Isn't that the game? No
I'm looking for a hookup
Oh, yes
So, the point of this exercise is
for you to find someone to copulate with?
Not so loud,
but ideally, yes
Thanks
Thank you
And what is my function as "wingman?"
You help me run my game
Okay
What is your game?
When I lie through my teeth to a woman,
you nod and agree
Hey, that's pretty cool
What is it?
It's a limited edition
Green Lantern lantern 
My friend is looking for someone to copulate with
You're very funny
I'm Abby
I'm Sheldon How do you do?
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali
Call me Raj Hi, Raj
Where are you from?
The mysterious subcontinent of India
Ooh, India
You know India? I saw Slumdog Millionaire 
Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist
I thought your father was a gynecologist
I'm sorry
Martha, come here
Meet Raj and Sheldon
This is my friend, Martha Hi
Hello Hello
Is that the limited edition
Green Lantern lantern? 
"In brightest day, in darkest night,
no evil shall escape my sight"
Oh, that is so awesome
Thank you
Have you chosen one to copulate with?
So, what should we talk about?
Well, we could always learn more
about why people who believe in psychics are idiots
Leonard?
Oh, we don't need to talk about that anymore
Leonard covered it pretty well in the car
I'm sorry, but facts are facts
Right, and if you can't understand it,
it's not a fact
No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact
Oh, got it
Thank you for educating me
You're welcome
How's your fish?
Amazing
Would you like to try some?
Yeah, sure Well, the fact is,
you can't
Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you're both scientists
Help me out here
What do you think-- want to jump
right in the middle of another couple's argument?
No, thank you
Sorry
Maybe we should just stop talking about this
Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether
How is everything tonight?
Really uncomfortable
You know, the best thing about being in a committed,
monogamous, mutually supportive relationship
is that even if you have different ideas,
you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for,
even make love with
Want your fish?
I knew you were going to do that
Doesn't make me psychic!
Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse

Hey

I don't like to kiss and tell,
but somebody made it to eighth base
What the hell is eighth base?
Seventh base with shirt off
Well, my shirt
How'd things go
with Penny?
Oh couldn't be better
Are we taking
our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?
It's not just Cylons
Superman's next
All right, I was going to try to squeeze in
a little more mocking before lunch,
but I can come back later
when you don't have a high-powered weapon
How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
Hey, I once dated a girl
who believed she was abducted by aliens
And that didn't bother you?
Au contraire
It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing
What am I supposed to do,
pretend I believe something I don't whenever I'm with Penny?
Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes all kinds of things
when she's with you
Do me a favor-- lean over, put your head right here
Let me show you another way to look at this
Here we have the universe of all women
These are the ones
you want to sleep with
These are the women who believe exactly what you believe
These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you
And right there in the little triple intersection
is your ideal mate
Odds are she's a short physicist with low self-esteem
who lives in a government research facility in China
What's your point?
In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny,
I have to give up everything I believe in--
my intellectual integrity, the very nature
of who I am?
I can't do that, Howard
I respect that
What is that?
Your new girlfriend
Have fun tonight
The dog

The roof

Grapes

One minute
Sis n 
What was that?
It means "come in"
It's taking forever to load
the new operating system on my computer
I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom,
and now I thought I'd learn Finnish
That's Hindi for
"Whatever floats your boat"
Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby,
and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again
What do you say?
I don't say anything
I merely offer you a facial expression
that suggests you've gone insane
I don't get it
You had a great time
Yes, exactly, I had a great time
That's done; I've moved on to other things
For example, after I learn Finnish,
I'm not going to learn Finnish again
Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy
far from home, and I want a girlfriend
and I want her to be Abby,
and she'll only come over if she can bring Martha
Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make,
threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy,
plea, invocation,
supplication, or vetoomus 
that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider
My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee 
Oh, my
I've admired these for years
So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
You can't wear the hands on the date
Hulk sad
Hey
Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?
Not only is it courteous,
it's safety smart
Every year, 15,000 fires are caused
by accidental dryer lint ignition
Now you're supposed to say,
"Wow, what an interesting fact
"Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy
I could never be mad at you"
Wow, that's all you got
after you were the most obnoxious person
on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?
No, I'm sorry
I really am It's not right
to mock what a person believes in
Thank you
Would you be willing to go to my psychic
and see what it's all about?
Would you be willing to read a book
that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
I would not
Okay, let's go see your psychic
Really?
Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind
You saying I don't have an open mind?
No, n-not at all Let me help you with this stuff
You know, I believe in ghosts, too
Great And astrology
I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals
Oh, no, no, no, crystals don't work
Really, that's the line?
Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?
Oh, voodoo's real
You don't want to mess with voodoo
Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay 
It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores
You know, I had never considered that
Wow, that's going to
completely change my visits there
Well, it's late
Uh-huh
Time for bed
Okay
Good night, puny human!
Sheldon?
Yes?
Listen, they're kind of
getting busy in the living room, and
I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while
Well, I suppose
Come in
I'll sleep in Leonard's room Good night

Seems like forever,
since the four of us have been out to eat, you know?
Just the guys
Oh, God! Yes, we get it
You have a girlfriend now
A little jealous, are we?
No, I'm not jealous
All right, I'd kill a hobo if it'll get me laid
Now, can we order?
Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu
So what? It's the same food
Oh, is it? Look at this
General Tso's Chicken
is no longer listed under "specialties"
It's now under "chicken"
So?
Yes, General Tso
Not "Tso," the chicken, "so" the question
So?
So, why is it no longer a specialty?
Did the chef lose confidence
in the dish or himself?
And look over here
"Shrimp in mobster sauce"
What is "mobster sauce"?
It's obviously a typo
Perhaps Or perhaps this restaurant's
now a front for organized crime
For all we know, the mobster sauce
contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters
No, no, no, no-- I think it just means
it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like
It doesn't mean any of that!
It's a typo
You know what? Let's just get a pizza
Good idea We'll go to Corleone's
Sure, no mobsters there
You know, the more I think about it,
the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain
chunks of mobster
And why is that?
It was listed under "seafood"
What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
(laughing)
Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?
LEONARD: What the?
The TV is gone
So are our laptops
Oh, God
Oh, God
Oh, God!
It's all right
They didn't take my comic books
Whatcha doing?
I'm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image
so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain
Interesting
I usually just have coffee
You've been up all night?
Is it morning?
Yes
Then I've been up all night
And you're stuck?
Why else would a person try to engage
their superior colliculus?
Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help you till I've had my coffee
Penny, I told you if you don't put him in his crate at night
he just runs around the apartment
What is he doing now?
LEONARD: Hmm, he's either isolating the terms
of his formula and examining them individually,
or
looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand
after Peter Pan cut it off
Captain Hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile,
not an alligator
If you're going to mock me, at least get your facts straight
Aye, aye, Captain
I can't see it!
It just won't coalesce
Maybe you need a fresh start
You're right
(tires squealing and car horns honking)
It's a great idea, Leonard Thank you
Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie
Listen, I got to go, but I'll see you tonight?
Okay
Bye-bye
No, you hang up first
Hello?
Dude, I'm glad you finally got a girlfriend,
but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff
in front of those of us who don't?
Actually, he might have to
There's an economic concept known as a positional good
in which an object is only valued by the possessor
because it's not possessed by others
The term was coined in 1976
by economist Fred Hirsch
to replace the more colloquial,
but less precise "neener-neener"
That's not true
My happiness is not dependent
on my best friend being miserable and alone
Thank you
Although, I'd be lying if I said
it wasn't a little bit of a perk
Who's miserable and alone?
Me
Oh
I used to be like that
Then I got a girlfriend
In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener
Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing
for your first Valentine's Day?
Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops
There's a $3995 lover's special at PF Chang's
Egg rolls, dumplings,
bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken
on the big marble horse out front
Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest
who was stoned and beheaded,
wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening
be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
I understand your point, but given a choice,
Jews always go with Chinese food
Well, if anyone's interested,
I'll be spending this Valentine's Day
the same way I spend every Valentine's Day
Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket,
taking it home, standing over the sink
and eating it out of the package
with my bare hands like an animal
Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse,
one asinine comment,
one lonely
man and his chicken
And let's see Who's left?
Oh, that's right My plans
Isn't anyone going to ask?
Fine, tell us you're going to have sex with Penny
That's not what I was going to tell you
It's okay
I don't mind hearing about your sex life 
It's his that bugs me
Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland
to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider
on February 14?
Professor Norton, although, God knows why
He hasn't published anything of note
since he won that Nobel Prize
Actually, Professor Norton can't make it
He threw his back out rock climbing
I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend
The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
That's the one
In any case,
they're asking me to fill in for him
In Switzerland or with the bi g-boobed weather girl?
Switzerland
And I get to bring a guest!
Oh, man! No way, dude!
This is incredible!
I'm so happy,
I'm not even going to question their judgment in picking you
I'm just going to run home and start packing
Why wouldn't you take Penny?
I am taking Penny 
Oh
Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation
when you get home
âTª Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state âTª
âTª Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait! âTª
âTª The Earth began to cool âTª
âTª The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools âTª
âTª We built the Wall âTª âTª We built the pyramids âTª 
âTª Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery âTª
âTª That all started with a big bang âTª
âTª Bang! âTª 
(knocking)
Sheldon, you got a minute?
Of course, my good friend
Come in
Help me out
Which ski hat says aprÃ¨s supercollider? 
Sheldon, I'm not taking you to Switzerland
Well, of course you are
Who else would you take?
Penny
What?
That's absurd
Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research
Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day
We can go sightseeing and skiing
and make love in front of a roaring fire
in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps
But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research
I'm sorry, Sheldon
Sorry?
I've been dreaming
about going to the Large Hadron Collider
since I was nine years old
Yeah, well, I've been dreaming about spending Valentine's Day
with a girl since I was six
Shame on you!
That's no dream for a scientist!
Okay, what's the big surprise?
Just a minute
This tray contains clues
as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine's Day
Oh Wow Okay
Let's see
We've got, uh, milk chocolate,
Swiss cheese, fondue
My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this
Then I'm going to climb on his back
and rocket to the moon?
No
But it does involve air travel
Okay, um
let me slice this Swiss cheese 
with my Swiss army knife, 
and then you can wash it down with a cup
of Swiss Miss instant cocoa 
Okay, I'm starting to think Swiss is key here
Uh-huh
We're going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?
How does that involve air travel?
We're going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn? 
No
Okay, sweetie, this started out fun,
but I'm over it
We're going to Switzerland
to see the CERN supercollider!
And ski We'll also go skiing
We're going skiing in Switzerland?!
Well, you'll ski, I'll fall, but, yeah,
we will be in Switzerland for Valentine's Day
Oh, my God, Leonard!
That's incredible!
SHELDON: Not so fast
You might want to hold off
on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny
Rabe-what-ly?
Rabeliechtli
It means turnip light
and refers to a traditional lantern
hand-carved from a root vegetable
and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals
Which you will not be celebrating
because A: these festivals occur in the fall;
and B:
you will not be going to Switzerland
Sheldon, we've been through this
I'm taking Penny
Afraid not
Do you recognize this?
Not the roommate agreement
Indeed, the roommate agreement
I call your attention to the Friendship Rider
in Appendix C: Future Commitments
"Number 37: in the event one friend is ever invited
"to visit the Large Hadron Collider,
"now under construction in Switzerland,
he shall invite the other friend to accompany him"
Oh, for God's sakes
You actually put that in an agreement?
Yeah We also put in what happens
if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant,
or if one of us gets superpowers,
or if one of us is bitten by a zombie
He can't kill me, even if I turn
Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
No, that seemed a little farfetched
Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?
I've lived up
to all my commitments under the agreement
At least once a day I ask how you are,
even though I simply don't care
I no longer
stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10:00 pm
And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing
Okay, I know I shouldn't ask, but what is? No
(low, two-toned vocalizing)
I'd be much further along if I'd been allowed to practice
Look, Sheldon,
I know it's in the agreement,
and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you
In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains
But I am taking Penny to Switzerland
Is that your final decision?
It is
Very well
It's not over, is it?
What do you think?
(low, two-toned vocalizing)
Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh?
Think it's gonna rain?
Instead of underpants,
I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning
Thoughts?
Okay, I know what'll cheer you up
Let's play one of your driving games
All right
This game is called Traitors
I will name three historical figures,
you put them in order
of the heinousness of their betrayal
Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr Leonard Hofstadter
You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
You're right
Judas had the decency to hang himself
after what he did
Come on, Sheldon
Can't you at least try to understand
how much this means to me?
Round two: Leonard Hofstadter,
Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch
Rupert Murdoch?
He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly 
Hint: he and Darth Vader are tied for #2
I'm sorry I couldn't hang with you last night
I had a date with Bernadette
I know
I saw the Tweet
So, what did you end up doing?
Not much
Nuked a burrito Oh
Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen
and your penis would droop like a willow tree
You seen Sheldon?
No Is he still mad about the supercollider?
Yeah He thinks I betrayed him
I mean, come on
What would you guys do if you were me?
I'd take Sheldon to Switzerland
Seriously?
Absolutely
And I'd leave him there
What the hell is that?
Uh, let's see
Yup, 30 pieces of silverware
Morning, old chum
What's going on?
I've made you breakfast
Juice, coffee,
and pancakes in the shape of some
of your favorite fictional characters
See, here's Frodo
You made Frodo pancakes?
Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet
If you need to void your bladder before eating,
I can keep them warm with this beret
that I thoroughly laundered
and pressed into service as a pancake cozy
Why are you doing this?
It's by way of an apology for my recent behavior
I've had some time
to reflect and I've come to realize
that friendship is not an aggregation
of written agreements
It's a result of two people
respecting and caring for each other
Butterscotch scone?
Thanks
It's good
What you're tasting is respect and affection
And about a pound of Crisco
After you've finished breakfast,
I thought we could spend the day
watching the final season of Babylon 5 
with director commentary
You hate Babylon 5 
I do It fails as drama/science fiction,
and it's hopelessly derivative
But you like it, and you're my friend
Okay, great
Still not taking you to Switzerland
Drat
No Frodo for you

Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland
to see the CERN supercollider:
a PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD
Oh, for God's sake
Here we have a highly gifted researcher
in the field of particle physics
whose work has brought him to the precipice
of forever changing mankind's understanding of the universe
AKA me
And here we have a waitress
brushing her teeth with her finger
AKA you
I'm sorry
Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
****
This is the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN in Switzerland,
the product of decades of planning and construction
It is a mecca for physicists the world over
This is Bath and Body Works
on Colorado Boulevard
They sell scented soaps and lotions,
some of which contain glitter
Now, let's see if we can match the individual
to the appropriate destination
O- kay
Show's over
No, it's not
I've got five more slides
Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision
He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go
Very well
Enjoy yourself
You're going to be in the presence of something
that I've dreamed of seeing for decades
I just hope you'll be able to appreciate
the magnitude of where you are and what it represents
I'll talk to Leonard
You will?
Yes
If it means that much to you, you should go
Oh, Penny, thank you!
You're welcome
Since I rarely hug,
I'm relying on your expertise regarding duration
I think we're there
Bye-bye
You know what?
Even though I don't have a girlfriend,
I can still have a good time on Valentine's Day
Trust me, you can't I've tried
No, no, no, I'm going to have a "me" day
First I'm going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown,
take a steam and get a massage
Then I'm going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies
Sheldon, I need to talk to you
All right, my friend
Would you like some cholermus?
Some what? Cholermus
It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish
I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system
for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland
You're not going to Switzerland!
Oh, but I am
Didn't Penny tell you the good news?
She told me that you went behind my back
to guilt her into letting you go instead of her
Yes, that good news
Well, forget it I was the one who was invited
I get to decide who goes with me,
and it's Penny, not you!
Howard, could you lower the lights?
I have a short PowerPoint presentation
I don't need to see your presentation
This discussion is over!
That's a somewhat ambiguous response
Am I going or not?
Sheldon, at this point,
I would go by myself before I would take you
Really?
Yeah, really
****
From this moment forward,
we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends
I'm sorry you feel that way
I don't think you're fully aware
of the ramifications here, Leonard (sighs)
Why don't you enlighten me?
With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified
you are no longer entitled to accompany me
to go swimming at Bill Gates' house should I be invited
Ooh, that's gotta sting
Just think, this time tomorrow
we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland
for our first Valentine's Day
I know!
I went shopping today
and bought special undies for the occasion
Thermal? 'Cause it's gonna be cold
Think it through, Leonard
Oh! Oh!
(both laugh)
(sneezes)
Gesundheit 
Or as they say in Switzerland,
gesundheit 
You getting a cold?
No, no, it's probably just allergies
Do you want an allergy pill?
'Cause I have 'em all
Prescription, nonprescription,
foreign, domestic, experimental
Do any of them work?
******
(blowing)
(Penny vomiting)
Penny?
(toilet flushing)
You okay?
Did that sound okay to you?
Do not come in here!
What's going on?
I'm having a tea party
What do you think's going on?
(hocking loogie)
I think I might have the flu
(vomiting)
Or the plague
Well, our plane leaves at 9:00 am
Do you think you'll feel better by then?
(vomiting)
Yep
'Cause I'm gonna be dead
Hey, Sheldon?
Listen, Penny is pretty sick
and she's not going to be able to go to Switzerland
So if you're still interested, you're welcome to come
(vomiting, coughing)
(toilet flushing)
Great
I'll start packing
In a minute
Oh, look, it's the cholermus
(vomiting)
Here's your soup
Chicken? Yes
With the little stars? Yes 
Heated to 180 degrees?
*******
You don't have to be mean
I'm sick
Yeah, well, I'm sick, too
Not my problem
I just don't understand how this happened to me
I'm scrupulous about my hygiene
I regularly disinfect my hands,
and I avoid contact with other people on general principle
I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon
Oh, Penny, thank you!
(in slow motion): You're welcome
It's you!
I touched you!
Happy Valentine's Day
Oh, my goodness, look at this room!
(gasps) Champagne!
Roses! Oh!
And little chocolates!
This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever
Yeah, I forgot about all this

Oh, I don't want to know that!
How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee

Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease

I can't decide
whether I want Stan Lee to autograph
my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor
or my Fantastic Four number five,
first appearance of Dr Doom
Alex, I'm going to go with what is
you're a dumbass?
I've decided I'm going to have Mr Lee sign my copy
of this month's Batman
That's crazy
Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman
Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one,
and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact,
which will set me apart from hoi polloi of comic book fandom
That's a great idea
I'm going to get him to sign a Batman as well
What is it about the word "unique" you don't understand?
Ow!
Damn, paper cut
Nothing worse than a paper cut
Well, obviously you don't remember your circumcision
There's Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer
Why don't you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
He does And in the kitchen
And in the car And in his pocket
Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine
Hi! Hey
Guess who's going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?
Um can you give me a hint?
Stan Lee
Um Stanley
Stanley Stanley Tucci?
No
No, Stan Lee
Oh, oh, Stan Lee!
Cool!
You have no idea who he is, do you?
Of course I do
You're an important part of my life
and I pay attention to the things you are interested in
Oh, good
Good
So, who's Stan Lee?
Um he was on Star Trek
Nope
Star Wars? No
Um uh, Stan Lee
Ooh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?
That's Bruce Lee
Oh
So, is this Bruce Lee's nerdy brother, Stan?
Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened
paychecks in your desk?
Because most of the things I'm planning to buy
haven't been invented yet
There-there must be thousands of dollars here
Why don't you put it in the bank?
I don't trust banks
I believe that when the robots rise up,
ATMs will lead the charge
You've also got something
from the Pasadena Municipal Court
Undoubtedly another snide response
to my repeated letters complaining
that the flags in front of the courthouse
are flying in the wrong order
From left to right, it's supposed to be
federal, state, and then city of Pasadena
I'm sorry You sent more than one letter about that?
It bothers me
Sheldon, this is a summons
A summons for what?
Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue
at 9:30 pm on November 16
They got you on a traffic camera
Nice picture
November 16?
Penny, that's the evening you fell in your bathtub
and I had to drive you to the emergency room
No, it isn't
Yes, it is
No, it isn't
Penny, I have an eidetic memory
Also, that's a picture of you in the passenger seat
holding your dislocated shoulder
Mmm, no, it isn't
Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation
committed in your car, bearing your license plates,
coming to me?
Okay, look, they sent me the ticket
I told them I wasn't driving
and they were all, "If it wasn't you, who was it?"
So you betrayed me?
No!
It wasn't a betrayal
It was more of a "I can't afford any more points on my license"
I already have to buy my insurance
from this place in the Cayman Islands
But the only reason I was driving your car
was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you
Yes, yes, look, and now
you have a photo to remember that heroic day
It's not that big a deal
You just go down to the court on Thursday
and you pay the fine
I'm not going to pay a fine
That would imply I'm guilty
You are guilty
That one I liked
I am not guilty
I only have a learner's permit
Penny was the teacher
When the light turned yellow she said "Go, go, go"
So I went, went, went
Sheldon, I'm sorry
I'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine
You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie
or my own TV series
You don't need to reimburse me because I'm not paying
On Thursday, I will have my day in court
and justice will be done
In fact, I'm going to begin preparing my defense right now
Okay, he's going to jail
Oh, that's right
Thursday is Stan Lee Day
Now you see what you've done?
Because of you, we're all going to miss Stan Lee
Whoa!
What do you mean "all?"
Well, you're my friends
You'll be standing by my side, supporting me,
feeding me legal precedents,
and if you had the upper body strength,
carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious
Yeah, okay No
Are you saying that you will not stand beside me
as I plead my case?
That's what I'm saying
Howard?
Wow
Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court
Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice
it would've been a much shorter movie No
Raj?
You'll be there, won't you?
All right, then
My so-called friends have forsaken me
So, I guess it'll just be me and my eyewitness
Oh, balls
Please try to wear something appropriate
It won't help my case
if the judge is busy trying to read the word "Juicy"
scrawled across your buttocks
Penny
Penny
Penny
That's just wrong
All right, let's go
Wait, hold on
Before we get to the courthouse,
I'd like to call on your skills as an actress
What is this?
I've taken the liberty
of scripting your appearance on the witness stand
because, let's face it, you're somewhat of a loose cannon
Now, don't worry; it's written in your vernacular
So shall we rehearse?
Do I have a choice?
Well, of course you have a choice
Although we live in a deterministic universe,
each individual has free will
Now, sit down
I call your attention
to the events of November 16
Do you remember that date?
"Darn tootin', I do
"If the court will excuse my homespun,
corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase"
That's excellent Go on
"The reason that date is, like,
"so totally fixed in my memory
"is that I had the privilege to be witness
to one of the most heroic acts I've ever seen in, like, ever"
"And who performed that heroic act?"
"Why, you did, sir
"You Dr Sheldon Cooper
And may I add, it is a privilege to know you"
"There's no need for compliments
This court is only interested in the facts"
"But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you
Totally"
A teardrop rolls down my cheek?!
Only a suggestion
A catch in your throat would work just as well
"But it is a fact
"that it's a privilege to know you
Totally"
Maybe you should put on your "Juicy" pants again
Pay the cashier
Sheldon Cooper
Good morning, Your Honor
Dr Sheldon Cooper
appearing in pro se
That is to say, representing himself
I know what it means
I went to law school
And yet you wound up in traffic court
Anyway,
if it would please the court,
I'd like to begin with an opening statement
The court would
advise you to make it quick,
as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning
and just took an Imodium
Very well
A quick opening statement
Like a milking stool,
my case rests on
three legs
I will demonstrate
that I was improperly instructed in driving
by a woman whose lack of respect for society
borders on the sociopathic
I will argue
that the emergency met the legal doctrine
of quod est necessarium est licitum--
that which is necessary is legal
But first,
I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue
I'm unable to confront my accuser,
a non-human entity, to wit,
a camera
So, to sum up:
improper instruction;
quod est necessarium est licitum;
Sixth Amendment
My milk stool is complete
Impressive
Thank you
Guilty
Pay the cashier
I object
You're completely ignoring the law
No, I'm following the law
I'm ignoring you
Really?
I would point out that I am at the top of my profession,
while you preside over the kiddy table of yours
Dr Cooper, before I find you in contempt
and throw you in jail, I'm going to give you a chance
to apologize for that last remark
I am a scientist
I never apologize for the truth
That's my spot

that start with the same letter
Oh, come on Why would you do that?
Bruce Banner, Reed Richards,
Sue Storm, Stephen Strange,
Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer,
Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all,
J Jonah Jameson, Jr
Okay, I'm cutting
I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off
Hey
Sheldon's in jail
Sheldon's in jail?!
You called it
What do you think? For what?
For doing the same crap he always does,
except to a judge
He has to stay in there until he apologizes
So tell him to apologize
Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard
That didn't occur to me
If he doesn't apologize by 5:00,
he is going to spend the night in jail
Oh, no, that's terrible
Ooh, the line's moving Got to go Bye
Excuse me?
Excuse me, jailor?
What?
I need to use the restroom
Knock yourself out
That's the toilet?
Well, it ain't a wishing well
Please tell the judge I'm ready to apologize
Look at that
"To my friend, Leonard
From Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
Awesome
Mine says, "To my friend, Howard
From Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
Mine says, "To Raj, from Stan Lee"
That's 'cause you pissed him off about his character names
Hey,
I didn't even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin,
Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts,
Victor Von Doom,
oh, and worst of all,
Millie the Model
We're home
Oh, hey, buddy How'd it go?
You know very well how it went
Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you
I was found guilty and fined $533
I'm going to write you a check for that
As long as you promise to put it in your drawer
and never cash it, like the others
I also now have three points
on a driver's license I do not yet possess,
and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology,
simply because I refuse to urinate
in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals
Plus, you didn't get to meet Stan Lee
Okay, that's enough, Howard
The poor guy's had a tough time
He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail
wearing that suit
You're right,
so it would be cruel to mention
that after he finished signing autographs,
Stanley took Stuart and us out for gelato
You had gelato with Stan Lee?
He said we could call him Stan
Except for Raj
Well, I hope you're satisfied, Penny
You are responsible
for all the evil that has befallen me today
Okay, I realize that Not finished
It is because of you
that I now have a criminal record,
and it is because of you that I missed out
on having gelato with Stan Lee
Okay, maybe you'll have another chance to have No, no
I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee
because opportunities to have
gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime
"The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!"
Did he just somehow give me the finger?
Not just the finger
The moving finger
Hey, Stuart
Oh, hey, Penny
Wow Hi
What's going on? Nothing
I'm just getting ready to close up and head out
Ah
Cool Got any fun plans?
Oh, yeah Big night tonight
Gonna share a can of tuna
with the cat
Oh, nice
Not even my cat
I just feed it
Some nights it doesn't even show up
Oh, okay
Well, I was hoping, um,
you could do me a favor
Sure, yeah, name it
Well, I'm kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee,
and I really want to make it up to him
So I was hoping you could give me his phone number
so maybe I can arrange for them to meet
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have his phone number
Hmm Damn
Mm All right Thank you
Mm-hmm
Wait
I have his address
Really?
Great!
But I can't give it to you
Then why did you tell me you had it?
I don't know Just chatting
You're looking at a guy
who could very well get stood up
by a stray cat tonight
I'm sorry, Stuart
Thanks anyway
Mm-hmm
Wait
Yeah?
Maybe we can make a deal
What kind of deal?
I will give you the address
if you go to my cousin's wedding with me
You're extorting a date out of me?
I kind of have to
The cousin who's getting married
is the cousin I usually go to weddings with
Can I bring Leonard?
Sure What the hell
Deal
We'll tell people he's your cousin
This is Stan Lee's front door
We were on Stan Lee's curb,
then we were on Stan Lee's walk,
and now we're at Stan Lee's
front door
Yup
Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee's doorbell
At Stan Lee's house
We're about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee
Okay, sweetie, I don't know if we're gonna have cookies,
or he's just gonna say hi,
or really what's gonna happen, so just let me
talk, and we'll ?
Yeah?
Are you Stan Lee?
Oh, damn
Hi I'm Penny This is my friend, Sheldon
We're not friends at the moment
Depends on how this goes
Right, right Anyway,
Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed
to meet you the other day at the comic book store,
but he kind of ended up in jail
I see And you thought
you'd just come over to my house uninvited?
You said we were invited
Oh, no, no, I said I'm inviting you
to come with me to Stan Lee's house
You know, you fan boys are unbelievable
Do you think you can just
ring my doorbell any time you want?
I mean, why don't you just come on in
and watch the Lakers game with me?
Well, I'm not much of a sports fan,
but thank you
I'm sorry
He doesn't really understand sarcasm
Well, I'll give him something he'll understand
Joanie, call the police!
Nice to meet you
Fantastic Four, Daredevil,
Invincible Iron Man,
Happy Hogan, Curt Connors
Would you just let it go?
And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom
Hey, where've you been?
I'll tell you where I've been
You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee
and gotten autographed comics,
but I saw the inside of his house
and got an autographed application
for a restraining order
Sweet
Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing
This is going to look great hanging next
to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy

Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
Well, it's very simple
In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose,
I'm the smart one,
Wolowitz is the funny one,
and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner
who struggles to understand our ways and fails
That leaves you, by default, as the muscle
Oh
One more floor, and I'd be the pulled muscle
Oh, it's about time
I'm starving
Um, well, we didn't actually get Chinese food
Why not? Don't panic
This is better
Oh, no
You didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?
Of course not
And technically, magic beans would be food
Although eating them would be quite a waste,
since you could plant them,
and overnight, have a giant beanstalk,
which would provide enough roughage for a small city
Yeah, sometimes I don't listen
Sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down
We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant
when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him
Who's Adam West?
Who's Adam West?!
Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?
My guess is, "Hey, four minutes!
New record!"
That's why I'm the funny one
Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale,
and they had the coolest stuff
They were closing up
We got this whole box for 60 bucks
We didn't even get to go through it all
There could be anything in here
There a new girlfriend in there?
'Cause you might need one
No
But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script
with actual slime stains!
Oh, you're right
It's Ghostbusters 2 
Never mind
Oh, my God
An Alf doll
When I was 11, my mother got me one
to help me sleep
after my dad left
I used to pretend
that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac,
and Alf was going to bring him back to me
But he never did
Where's my daddy, puppet?
Where is he?
That is so sad
No, what's sad is that you don't know
Adam West was TV's Batman
Okay in Avatar when they gave sex in Pandora
they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails
are like their junk
Yeah so?
So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds,
they also use their ponytails
What's your point?
My point is, if I were a horse or a bird,
I'd be very nervous around James Cameron
It amazes me how you constantly obsess
over fictional details
when there are more important things
in the real world to worry about
For example, why wasn't William Shatner
in the new Star Trek movie?
Hey, Sheldon
I was up in the administration office,
and I happened to overhear
the name of the winner
of this year's Chancellor's Award for Science
And you want to rub my nose in the fact
that my contributions are being overlooked again?
I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics
All right, I'll play
What self-important, preening fraud
are they honoring this year?
Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that You
I won? You won
I won!
This is astonishing
Not that I won the award-- no one deserves it more
Actually, I guess I misspoke
It's not astonishing; more like inevitable
I'm not sure what to do first
Maybe I should call my mother
Wait! I know-- I'm going to conduct an interview
with myself and post it online
Well, good for him
Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner
of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost
Having a little trouble catching your breath there?
No, no, I'm good
If my PE teachers had told me this is what I was training for,
I would have tried a lot harder
"Do or do not There is no try"
Did you just quote Star Wars? 
I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back 
Oh, my God
I'm lying in bed with a beautiful woman
who can quote Yoda
I love you, Penny
Oh
Thank you
You're welcome
I just wanted to put that out there
Oh, yeah, no, I-I'm-I'm glad
Good
Glad is good Yeah
Yeah
No, no
Um
So, it's getting pretty late
We should probably go to sleep Yeah
Okay Yeah, probably
Okay, good night, sweetie Good night
Oh, damn, they canceled my Visa
Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!
Uh-oh
What?
I was going to get my mail
Okay
Are are you hoping to get it telepathically?
I think you mean telekinetically
And no
I just wasn't sure
of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard
are no longer having coitus
God, can we please just say "no longer seeing each other"?
Well, we could if it were true
But as you live in the same building,
you see each other all the time
The variable which has changed is the coitus
Okay, here's the protocol:
you and I are still friends, and you stop saying "coitus"
Good, good
I'm glad we're still friends
Really?
Oh, yes It was a lot of work
to accommodate you in my life
I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain
Right
Just to be clear, do I have to stop
saying "coitus" with everyone or just you?
Everyone
Harsh terms
But all right-- I'll just substitute "intercourse"
Great
Or "fornication"
Yeah But that has judgmental overtones,
so I'll hold that in reserve
So, how you been?
Well, my existence is a continuum,
so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period
You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?
Bazinga Mm-hmm
How's Leonard doing?
He seems all right
Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time
looking at photographs of you
and smelling the pillow you slept on
Oh, but now that I think of it,
he asked me not to tell you that
I'll pretend I didn't hear it
I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it
I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce
Yep
That's the sauce my mother uses
She likes cooking Italian because according to her,
that's what the Romans made Jesus eat
Interesting
I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night
I'm hungry now
Oh Um, okay
Why don't you give me an hour and come over?
Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks
and mix them in with the sauce?
I don't have hot dogs
Oh, it's all right; I do
Oh! You're in for what my mother calls "a real Eye-talian treat""
Hey, where you been?
I was talking with Penny
What's wrong with you?
You can't hang out with your roommate's ex
That's totally uncool
No, it's fine I don't care
I'm over it
Yeah, he's over it; that's why he's been whining all day
about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo
from Men in Black 
Is he making any progress?
Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil
So would Ben Affleck
The point is, in a situation like this
you got to pick sides
You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny
Which one picks last?
What?
Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last
Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair
Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken
I hope you're hungry
Well, of course I'm hungry
And as I have no plans to eat with any other team,
I will consume my tangerine chicken
with the appropriate gusto
Mm, mm, mm!
Okay
Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?
I don't know Why?
Just making dinner conversation
Go, Team Leonard!
Hold
What?
Explain your sneeze
I'm sorry?
Do you have allergies? No
Is there too much pepper on your salad?
I don't put pepper on salads
I've heard enough Sit over there
Oh, come on
I don't want to sit by myself
That's what Typhoid Mary said,
and clearly, her friends buckled
Guys, help me
Sheldon, come on
Yeah, it's just one sneeze
You're on your own See you, buddy
Oh, Leonard, I have something for you
Per our roommate agreement, this is
your 24-hour notice that I will be having
a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment
When you say "non-related female,"
you still mean human, right?
Of course
Pets are banned under the roommate agreement,
with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs
and, one day, cybernetically- enhanced helper monkeys
Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
Sarcasm?
Yes, but mixed with genuine concern
For your information, I'll be playing host
to Dr Elizabeth Plimpton
The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
Yes
And until you acquire a surgical mask,
please address your comments to me through a napkin
We've been corresponding for years about
our mutual interest in
gravitational wave signatures
of inflatons in the early universe
And now she's under consideration
for a position at our university
Why didn't you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton?
I am a huge fan of hers!
I didn't realize I was obligated to share my connection
with things you're a fan of, but very well
You enjoy Canadian bacon
I've been to Toronto
Okay, fine
Where is she going to sleep?
My room, of course
Holy crap!
Holy crap!
Yeah, um, I have a two-part question
Go ahead
A) Are you kidding me?
And B) seriously, are you freaking kidding me?
A) I rarely kid
And B) when I do kid, you will know it
by my use of the word "bazinga"
So you're saying the two of you
are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
Yes
Bazinga
Leonard?
Thank you
Why is a world- renowned scientist
staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
Well, she doesn't care for hotels
And who can blame her?
Windows that don't open,
multi-user linens,
keys shaped like credit cards- as if one walks around
with unassigned slots in one's wallet
All right, I believe I have time
for one more question
Yes, Raj?
When can I sit with you again?
When I've seen
two consecutive negative throat cultures
spaced 12 hours apart You know the drill
All right,
if you'll excuse me, I am off to start
a prophylactic course of antibiotics
I can't believe he's friends with Elizabeth Plimpton
I can't believe they let him into Canada
Whoa, whoa, whoa You heard the man
Where's your throat cultures?
Kidding Sit down
??Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state ??

Hey, Sheldon
Oh, Penny, excellent
I have a question about these maxi pads
Are the wings truly functional
or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?
What?
Why are you doing with-- what?
The stock boy at Walgreens
was frustratingly uninformed on the subject
Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?
I have a lady friend
who will be staying with me for a few days
Oh
What?
I want her to feel at home
I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol,
calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt
specifically designed to regulate the female bowel
Wait, wait, hold on, back up
You're having a woman stay with you?
Yes
Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
Oh no, no, no, no
I'm not flabbergasted
I'm puzzled
Yeah, let's go with puzzled
A word of warning
My guest is a noted physicist
and the leading expert on quantum cosmology,
so please try to avoid wasting her time
with female jibber jabber
Female jibber jabber?
Shoe sales, hair styles,
mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina
Oh, they're not my friends
I'm not surprised, considering the way
you talk about them behind their backs
She's here, she's here
How do I look? Do I look smart?
Oh, good grief
This isn't about you
Coming!
Now, listen
One of the great minds
of the 21st century is about to play host
to one of the other great minds of the 21st century
So pay attention
Years from now,
my biographer might ask you about this event
Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer
Dr Cooper, thank goodness
I completely forgot your address
But then I remembered that I'd written it on my hand
Lucky for me,
I didn't confuse it with what I'd written
on my other hand, which are the coordinates
for a newly discovered neutron star
'Cause if I tried to go there, I'd be crushed by hypergravity
Anyway, hello Hello
Nice to finally meet you in person
I would imagine it is
This is my friend and roommate, Dr Leonard Hofstadter
Hi-lo
Oops
I-I started to say "hi,"
and then I switched to "hello" in the middle
It came out "hi-lo"
Duh
Uh, it's nice to meet you
I-I've read both your books and most of your papers
I-I'm Leonard, I live here, you're brilliant
I apologize
He's only an experimental physicist
No need to apologize
Some of my best friends are experimental physicists
Well, not
my best friends, but I know them
My best friend is
a molecular chemist named Wendy
I'm sorry, I'm rambling
Hi-lo
Are you hungry, thirsty?
Can I offer you anything?
No, she's my guest If anyone should
offer her anything, it should be me
Elizabeth, can I get you something?
Perhaps a feminine hygiene product
or a bowel-regulating yogurt?
Interesting choices
Based on my current needs, I guess I'd pick the yogurt
Excellent
If the yogurt works,
I bought some delightful scented candles
Look, it's you
Thank you so much for opening up your home to me
Well, who wants to stay in a hotel?
Windows that don't open, those crazy card-shaped keys
I'm so glad you understand
No, he doesn't understand
I understand
Well, I understand, too
You're just misappropriating my understanding
Oh
I think any university would want you
Except, of course,
any university that had already had you
Because they would've already wanted you
before they, you know, got you
From the mind that brought you "hi-lo"
Let me show you to your room
All right
I guess I am tired Good night, Leonard
Uh, sleep night
I mean, obously, good night
I started to say "sleep tight,"
then I changed my mind in the middle
I swear to God, I'm smart
Get it together, man
All right, let me show you
some of the features of the room
First, windows
Conventional
Open, closed
Open, closed
Halfway open
Or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent
Over here is my comic book collection
Feel free to browse
There's a box of disposable reading gloves
on the night stand
Good to know
In here, you'll find
emergency provisions
An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow,
season two of Star Trek: The Original Series
on a high-density flash drive
What if there's a disaster
that destroys all the USB ports?
Then there's really no reason to live, is there?
Can I ask a question about your roommate?
He's an odd duck, isn't he?
What's his relationship status?
Well, there was a misbegotten adventure
with a waitress who lives across the hall
It ended as inexplicably as it began
They had very little in common,
except for carnal activity
That's why I acquired
these noise-canceling headphones
If you decide to use them,
please clean the ear pieces afterwards
with the Wet Wipes you'll find in the bathroom
They're in the drawer labeled "Wet Wipes"
Okay
Good I'll leave you
to your nighttime ablutions
I've e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule
You'll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet
It's on the back of the emergency escape route diagram
How thoughtful
Sleep well, my friend You, too
Oh, let me just get one thing
It's my backup emergency supply kit
The living room escape route doesn't pass through here
Now, good night
And if there's an apocalypse, good luck
Yes?
I saw your light on
Is everything all right?
Yeah, I just couldn't sleep
Me neither
Oh, look what I'm reading
It's you
I thought you already read it
I did, but it's been a while,
and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast
Aw, you're smart
Oh, good
Wasn't sure it was coming across
What chapter are you on?
Uh, six
Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder
Want to know a little secret?
Sure
I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect
completely naked
Really?
Uh, sure doesn't read that way
Here, let me show yo
When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars,
we start to see
a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies
found in Hubble's constant
Wow
You really make science come alive
Vocal test Morning vocal test
Second vocal test
Second morning vocal test
Morning, Sheldon
Morning
Morning, Sheldon
Morning
I trust you had a pleasant night
More than pleasant
Excuse me, I'm going to relieve myself
How do you take your coffee?
Black Okeydoke
Pee for Houston, pee for Austin,
pee for the state my heart got lost in
And shake twice for Texas
Something his mother taught him
All right, Elizabeth,
the bathroom is yours
The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection
That's very thoughtful, but I think I'll finish my coffee first
Ah, so the yogurt didn't work
I'll fire off
a critical e-mail to the manufacturer
Oh, good, you're up
Look, my car won't start
I need a ride to work
Did you once again ignore your "check engine" light?
No, Mr smarty-pants
I ignored the "fill gas tank" light
Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her
in order to get a ride to work
Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug
Hello
Hi
Oh, Penny, this is Dr Plimpton--
a leading expert on quantum cosmology
Dr Plimpton, Penny is a waitress
who doesn't understand the role gasoline plays
in the internal combustion engine
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you, too
Are you enjoying your stay?
Yes, very much
Good
Wonderful Meaningless pleasantries accomplished
Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time is coming up,
and believe me, you do not want to follow him
Excuse me
Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed
so I can take everyone to work
You and Sheldon
and Sheldon's friend,
Dr Plimpton, who you just met
Gonna be fun
Like a clown car
Hang on Hmm?
Yeah? What? Huh?
We just broke up
Wha-- uh, you and me? Yeah, we did
Not too long ago
How are you doing with it?
Not as good as you apparently
I, um, I don't follow
You know what? It's, it's none of my business
If you want to sleep with Sheldon's doctor buddy
right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it
Well, now Excuse me
I'm uncomfortable with you recommending
that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr Plimpton,
who I assure you has better things to do
I'm not recommending it
I'm saying it already happened
That's preposterous
Tell her, Leonard
Well
No
Come on It wasn't my fault
The implication being that you sow tripped
and fell into her lady parts?
You know what?
I'm just gonna take the bus to work
Penny, I can still drive you
Oh, no, no, it's okay
You might slip on a banana peel
and get me pregnant
I must say,
I'm ocked by this betrayal
I didn't betray Penny
Not Penny, me!
How am I betraying you?
izabeth's my friend, and you're playingith her!
Yeah, I guess I did
What the hell are you doing?
Relax, it's Nyquil
You still have a cold?
Maybe, but I don't care
That's the great thing
about Nyquil, it's like ten-percent booze
I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing
so you can talk to girls medicine
Are you having trouble sleeping?
'Cause, boy, I was up all night
Did you get a cold, too?
No, but I was awake all night
If you want,
I can give you some of my mom's sleeping pills
She won't notice they're missing?
She doesn't kn she takes them
No, that's okay
It was something else keeping me up last night
And again this morning
And I didn't mind
I was up last night
I was up this morning
I didn't mind
Those are your clues
Ooh, ooh
Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?
No
Were you up mang another stop-motion Legoovie?
No
'Cause let me tell you,
it's not enough to make the Legos move,
they also have to capture your heart
Okay, I'll give you one more clue
It involved another person
did you get a Japanese love pillow?
How is a Japanese love pillow another person?
It is if you love her and give her a name
Dr Plimpton, I'd like you to meet my colleagues--
Dr Rajesh Koothrappali
Hi and not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz
Hi
I'm a big fan of your work Thank you
And of course, you've already introduced yourself
to Dr Hofstadter
Hey, you
Hey, you
Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out
How are you feeling, Elizabeth?
You know what?
I am a little tired
Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?
Sure
Black, right?
Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet
Coming right up
What?
What do you mean "what? " It's Halo night
I can't I'm too sick
Go away
That's why we moved Halo night here
Look, I brought my mom's chicken soup
I'm not hungry
Don't send him away
Let him in Who's that
I bought a parrot
Yeah, right
Dr Plimpton?
Hi Howard, right?
Uh, yeah
Can I ask you a question, Howard?
Do you like role-playing games?
Yeah, sure
In fact, I'm a dungeon master
Not tonight
Tonight you are a delivery man
You brought soup,
but uh-oh, Raj and I don't have enough money to pay you
So we'll have to come to some other kind of arrangement
Beg your pardon?
You two figure out the details,
I'm going to go change into something
I don't mind getting ripped off my milky flesh
What the frak?
Go away
She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli
Besides, you have a girlfriend
We broke up weeks ago
Why didn't you say anything?
I was waiting for the right time
This is the right time
Hey, who's ready for Halo?
Oh, this is like a nightmare
Get lost!
He's right The numbers are shaky enough as it is
I don't understand
Oh, good
Leonard's here
Good?!
Elizabeth?
What's going on?
What's going on is you and Howard are my moving men
and Raj is my new landlord
and I don't have enough money to pay any of you
Is she suggesting what I think she's suggesting?
Yep
Welcome to the Penthouse Forum
Okay, show of hands Who's up for this?
We'll all be naked in front of each other
I'm out
Everybody ready?
Follow my lead
Almost
We're, we're going to go out
into the hallway and, uh,
make a dramatic entrance
Oh, good It's so much better when everyone commits
Run Run, run, run Don't look back
I thought we had something special
So, you say you can't pay your rent
Oh, Leonard?
Hey
I found these in the dryer
I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon
Thanks
It's really hard to find these in his size
So, listen
I've been meaning to talk to you about the other morning
You mean you and Dr Slutbunny?
Yeah, I wanted to explain
Well, you don't owe me an explanation
I don't?
No, you don't
So you're not judging me?
Oh, I'm judging you nine ways to Sunday,
but you don't owe me an explanation
Nevertheless, I'd like to get one on the record
so you can understand why I did what I did
I'm listening
-- Sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> -- -- Resync for 720p by Baqinardo -- -- for <font color=#00FFFF>wwwaddic7edcom</font> --
She let me
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Okay, Babydoll Pink, let's see if you can cover up the fact
that I got my dad's feet
LEONARD: It's just two degrees, Sheldon
I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!
SHELDON: Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference
between water and steam
LEONARD: Yes, if we lived in a teakettle
SHELDON: This is the temperature you agreed to
in the roommate agreement
LEONARD: Aw, screw the roommate agreement!
SHELDON: No, you don't screw the roommate agreement
The roommate agreement screws you
LEONARD: You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat
SHELDON: I don't have to go to Hell
At 73 degrees, I'm there already!
(door slams)
(insistent knocking) Who is it?
Leonard
Hang on
Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
Uh, well, you can try,
but the people across the hall are being very noisy
You heard that, huh?
Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat,
then the other fella went bat-crap crazy
So you agree, he's nuts
Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him
Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him
Oh, I do not believe that
You are so naive
Just like I was seven years ago
I'd just started at the university 
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sheldon Cooper's apartment
Oh, I bet you're here to check out the room for rent
Yeah Run away, dude
What?!
Run fast, run far
That should have been my first clue
Okay, we've got power to the laser
I should've brought an umbrella
What for? It's not going to rain
I know that, but with skin as fair as mine,
moon burn is a real possibility
That's a "bazinga," right?
One of my best, don't you think?
(forced giggle)
Howard, do you want to double-check
the equatorial mount on the laser?
We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility
You got it
Oh, Raj, no
Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet
and filling it with pictures of naked women,
so we don't have to peep through windows
It's not like that
I'm watching someone's TV
The Good Wife is on
I tell you, this is my new Grey's Anatomy 
Leonard, Leonard
What is that? What is that?
Relax, it's just a dirty sock
How on earth can you say
"dirty sock" and "relax" in the same sentence?
Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks
Not my world
Hey, you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment? Penny
I wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing
Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon
by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object
Why don't you ask her to come up?
I don't know, it's still
a little weird since, you know
She dumped you? She didn't dump me
We were just in different places in the relationship
I fail to see how a relationship
can have the qualities of a geographic location
Oh, it's very simple
Leonard was living in a little town
called "Please don't leave me"
while Penny had just moved to the island of "Buh-bye"
Screw you guys
I'm gonna go see if she's home
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to point this at the moon now
Wait a second
The good wife is crying
Something's very wrong
(whirring)
And now the kung pao chicken
Ah, yeah Wow
Smooth
And finally,
my moo shu pork
(whirring)
Whoo-hoo!
WOLOWITZ: Oh, there you have it, gentlemen
Our entire dinner unpacked by robot
And it only took 28 minutes
Impressive,
but we must be cautious Why?
Today, it's a Chinese food retrieval robot
Tomorrow, it travels back in time
and tries to kill Sarah Connor
I don't think that's going to happen, Sheldon
No one ever does
That's why it happens
(door opening)
Hey Is the food here?
Ooh What's that?
That, dear lady,
is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand,
designed for extravehicular repairs
on the International Space Station
Ah, cool
Ask me to pass the soy sauce
Oh, does that come up much on the space station?
Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts
All right Pass the soy sauce Coming up
(inhales, clears throat)
(rapid typing)
So how's work?
Oh, it's not bad
Kind of hungry
Yeah, we all are
Just wait
You realize, Penny, that the technology
that went into this arm will one day make
unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete
Really?
They're going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
I thought you broke up with her
Why is she here?
Okay, here we go
Passing the soy sauce
(whirring)
Put out your hand
Oh!
(Penny laughing)
That's amazing
I wouldn't say amazing
At best, it's a modest leap forward
from the basic technology
that gave us Country Bear Jamboree
Hey, Sheldon?
Yes?
(whirring)
Peace?
No, not peace
Hang on
Whatcha doin' there?
Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
The humorous implication being that I am Wile E Coyote?
Yes
And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device
that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
Yes
(quick chuckle)
What I'm doing here
is trying to determine when I'm going to die
A lot of people are working on that research
So what is all this?
My family history factoring in longevity,
propensity for disease, et cetera
Interesting
Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB
What's "KBB"?
"Killed by badger"
How's that?
It was Thanksgiving
Uncle Carl said, "I think
"there's a badger living in our chimney
Hand me that flashlight"
Those were the last words
he ever spoke to us
I don't think you need
to worry about death by badgers being hereditary
Not true
The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically
Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded
against a brawny member of the weasel family
Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA?
You can always get a badger and find out
(quick chuckle)
But seriously,
even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor,
at best I have 60 years left
That long, huh?
60 only takes me to here
I need to get to here
What's there?
The earliest estimate of the singularity,
when man will be able to transfer his consciousness
into machines and achieve immortality
So, you're upset about missing out
on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?
By this much
Tough break
You want eggs?
You don't get it, Leonard
I'm going to miss so much--
the unified field theory, cold fusion, the dogapus
What's a dogapus?
The hybrid dog and octopus
Man's underwater best friend
Is somebody working on that?
I was going to
I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday
Wait a minute You hate dogs
A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls
No one can hate that
All right, I'm ready for my next question
In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets,
who wins the Second World War?
Uganda
Defend
Kenya rises to power
on the export of rhinoceroses
A Central African power block is formed,
colonizing North Africa and Europe
When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino
Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs
Correct
My turn
In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument,
on what does Scott Joplin play "The Maple Leaf Rag"?
Tuned bayonets
Defend
Isn't it obvious?
You're right My apologies
What the hell are you guys playing?
It's a game we invented
It's called Counterfactuals
We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours
in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other
It's fun for ages eight to 80
Join us
All right
I like a good brainteaser
Give it a whirl
You're in luck; this is an easy one
In a world where mankind is ruled
by a giant intelligent beaver,
what food is no longer consumed?
Uh a BLT where the "B" stands for beaver?
I don't know
Leonard, be serious
We're playing a game here
(clears throat)
I can figure this out
Let's see
Um, well, beavers eat tree bark
The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon
So, I'll say cinnamon
Incorrect
Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish
What?
In a world ruled by a giant beaver,
mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord
The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded
Thousands die
Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry
How does one miss that?
This is ridiculous
You're just making stuff up
Is he always like this when he loses?
Oh, yes
You should've been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008
You bumped the table and you know it
Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game
more suited to his abilities
We'll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide
I'm going to my room
Very good, Leonard
But next time, don't tell us where you're hiding
I'm telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light,
then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong
Yes, well, if we lived in a world
where slow-moving xenon produced light,
then you'd be correct
Also, pigs would fly,
my derriere would produce cotton candy,
and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic
Oh, you're so arrogant
If you were a superhero,
your name would be Captain Arrogant
And you know what your superpower would be?
Arrogance
You're wrong again
If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr Arroganto
I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together
Yeah, it's like if Alien and Predator decided
to go partners in a Jamba Juice
Has it occurred to you you're missing the big picture?
If you look at neutron scattering data Oh, Penny?
Penny? What's up?
Nothing I just wanted
to make Raj stop talking
No, no, no
He won Suck it up
Well, I'd ask you guys if you want dessert,
but I know Sheldon doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays
And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me
Howard won't order anything,
but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment
involving the words pie or cheesecake
And Leonard's lactose intolerant,
so he can't eat anything here
without his intestines blowing up
like a balloon animal
Hang on a second
I could have the fruit platter
You want the fruit platter?
Does it have melon on it? Yeah
No, I can't eat melon
Oh, Howard, heads up
Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift
When was the last time you saw her?
Oh, not since we broke up
Wow How am I going to play this?
Sophisticated and relaxed?
Friendly, noncommittal?
Cold and distant?
Hi, guys Hey
Hello
I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened
It's one of his best moves
(machine-gun fire on TV)
All I'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent
trying to make a decent Hulk movie,
they could probably just make an actual Hulk
That is apt and amusing
I think I shall share that
with Amy Farrah Fowler
She'll appreciate the witticism
Thank you
It'll also help improve her initial impression of you
So what's going on with you two?
Well, the status is as it always was
She's a girl She's a friend
She is not my--
please forgive me for doing this--
"girlfriend"
Right, right
So you're still just texting and emailing?
You don't feel any need to hang out with her, you know--
be in the same room?
Leonard, you are my best friend
I've known you for seven years,
and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you
Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity
to Amy Farrah Fowler
Got it
I sense judgment on your part
No, no
Maybe a little
May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy
Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
I have a functioning and satisfying relationship
with a female
You have none
Oh, right That
Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster--
not unlike the Hulk--
who, by the way, also has a girlfriend
In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly,
whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe
in A Beautiful Mind, 
a feel-good romp if there ever was one
I'm not jealous
(grunts like the Hulk)
Leonard not jealous
(groans in disgust)
Problem?
This is the worst cobbler I've ever eaten
It tastes like it's made of actual ground-up shoemaker
Amusing A play on the two meanings of "cobbler"
(laughs)
Hey, guys Guess who I found at LAX?
My baby sister Priya
Excuse me, I object
You propose a guessing game,
yet you don't give me enough time to guess
For the record, I was going to say:
"Your sister Priya"
Oh, Sheldon You haven't changed a bit, have you?
Why would I change?
The hope has been that
you'd eventually bend to public opinion
So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?
I have a one-day layover on my way to Toronto
Corporate merger
Can you believe it?
Little Priya's one of the lead attorneys
for the biggest car company in India
Given that when we met her, she was finishing law school
and planning an internship at a large Indian car company,
it's actually extremely plausible
And your poll numbers just keep dropping
I want to catch up with all of you,
but first I really must visit the loo
I'm going, too; I'll show you where it is
All right, this goes without saying,
but I'm just going to say it anyway
Hands off my sister
Why would I touch her? She's covered with airplane germs
I'm so not talking to you I'm talking to him
Hey I've got a girlfriend now Oh, please
My sister's much hotter
than your girlfriend, and you know it
Let's just agree they're both hot
But dude, that's my sister you're talking about!
Okay, forget who's hotter
The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact
out of respect to our friendship and to you
that neither of us would hit on her
Did you pinky-swear?
Yes
Okay, then
Cobbler I'm still laughing
It's really nice to see you again, Leonard
Yeah It's good to see you, too
Here you go
Thanks
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay
No, seriously, I think
I've finally figured out my problem with women
The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family
What does that have to do with me and women?
Nothing It was a desperate attempt
to introduce an alternate topic of conversation
My problem is, I don't project confidence
So I decided that the next time I meet a woman
I think is attractive, rather than holding back
and being cautious, I'm going to assume
the mantle of self-assurance
Oh, yeah? What's that look like?
Hi
I'm Leonard
And you are beautiful
You pop, sparkle and buzz electric
I'm going to pick you up at 8:00,
show you a night you will never forget
Where are we going?
Good news
I made it onto the team
for the new Defense Department
laser-equipped surveillance satellite
Excuse me
If we're changing topics, I believe I have first dibs
with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo
Congratulations, Howard
WOLOWITZ: Thanks
Listen, I have to get a security clearance,
so you guys might be hearing from the FBI
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't want to speak to the FBI
Why not?
I'm brown and I talk funny
They're just doing a background check on me
It doesn't matter; they'll find a reason
to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville
By the way,
when I say that, it's not offensive
Don't be ridiculous, Raj
You're here legally
Nobody cares Do you know how long it's been
since I got through airport security
without being given a colonoscopy?
You know, I try very hard
to make our lunch hours educational and informative,
but your insistence on talking about your own lives
stymies me at every turn
Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents
1No, you squandered your time with me,
and the moment has now passed
Feast on your disappointment,
much as the capybara feasts on its own waste
Okay, help me out here
How does an archeology professor get that good with a whip?
Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore
That's how I learned
I can't believe you've never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark 
And I can't believe you've never read Eat, Pray, Love 
When she comes out with
Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I'll read it
I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life,
I'm not reading it
You know, I could totally rock a hat like that
That's the work of noted Hollywood costume designer
Deborah Nadoolman
She also designed
the iconic red and black jacket
in Michael Jackson's Thriller video,
which I've never viewed in its entirety,
as I find zombies dancing
in choreographed synchronicity implausible
And also, it's really scary
Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
There's no switch Just listen and learn
Penny, if you think this is good,
you should come with us Friday
to see it on the big screen at the Colonial
Well, I'm watching it now
Why would I want to see it again on Friday?
Because the print they're showing on Friday
has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage
21 seconds? That'll be like seeing a whole new movie!
Exactly
They say it finally solves the submarine controversy
Did-- Leonard?
I'm no expert, but I believe
what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm
Oh! Good
I'm eight for 26 this month
Yeah, I think I'll pass
But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds
Bet if I could make you understand
why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together
Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't
Uh-huh
I'm guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too
Clarify something for me
Isn't the point
of a communal meal
the exchange of ideas and opinions?
An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
It is
You just kind of put a damper on things
when you said, "The next person I see talking
with food in their mouth will be put to death"
Well, we could argue about who said what all night long,
but to set things back on course,
I will propose a new topic of conversation
(groans) (groans)
Great
What is the best number?
By the way, there's only one correct answer
5,318,008?
Wrong
The best number is 73
You're probably wondering why
No Uh-uh We're good
73 is the 21st prime number
Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21,
is the product of multiplying--
hang on to your hats-- seven and three
Eh? Eh? Did I lie?
We get it
73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers
Chuck Norris wishes
In binary, 73 is a palindrome:
"one-zero-zero- one-zero-zero-one"
which backwards is "one-zero- zero-one-zero-zero-one"--
exactly the same
All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is: "Sirron Kcuhc"
Just for the record,
when you enter 5,318,008 on a calculator,
upside-down it spells "boobies""
Remember when you were wondering
why the girls didn't want to eat with us tonight?
Yeah, I get it now
I love your little heart locket, Bernadette
Oh, thanks
Howard gave it to me
It's the cutest thing
Every time I have dinner with his mom,
the next day I get jewelry
Did you know that the iconic Valentine's heart shape
is not actually based on the shape of a human heart,
but rather on the shape of the buttocks
of a female bending over?
Oh, so I spent seventh grade
dotting my I's with little asses?
Cool
Hey, Penny, how's it going?
Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?
My dad's company prints the menus for this place
I'm just dropping off some new ones laminated
Makes 'em easier to clean if people throw up on 'em
Guess how I got the idea?
Yeah, I got it, I got it
Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy
- Hi - Hey
Hoo
Okay, well, it was good to see you
Yeah, you, too
He's really cute How do you know him?
Oh, we went out a couple of times
I'm often flummoxed by current slang
Does "went out" mean "had intercourse"?
Yes No, no
But in this case, yes
Interesting
And was it not satisfactory?
No, it was great
He just didn't really challenge me on an intellectual level
Couldn't you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
Wouldn't help Zack can't even spell NPR
It's what I do with Howard
I'm much smarter than he is
But it's important to protect his manhood
Hoo
What's the matter?
I'm suddenly feeling flushed
My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy,
my mouth is dry
In addition, I keep involuntarily saying "hoo"
Oh, we know what's causing that, don't we?
It's no mystery
I obviously have the flu
coupled with sudden-onset Tourette's syndrome
Water Demon
Ice Dragon
Lesser Warlord of Ka'a
Not so fast
Infinite Sheldon
Infinite Sheldon?
Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards
and does not violate the rule against homemade cards
because I made it at work
Do you understand why people don't want to play with you?
No
although it's a question I've been pondering since preschool
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox
- Oh, thanks - Mm-hmm
Check it out-- all about planets this month
That's an atom
Agree to disagree
That's what I love about science--
there's no one right answer
So
you and Zack again, huh?
Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again
Were we here earlier?
Okay, we should, we should go
Ah, not yet
I want to talk science with the science dudes
Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you
What do you want to talk about--
rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?
You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel
Turns out that if you kill a starfish,
it'll just come back to life
Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts?
Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon
No, I'm almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel
It was a great show
They also said dolphins might be smarter than people
They might be smarter than some people
Maybe we can do an experiment to find out
That's easy enough
We'd need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through,
and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats
you find tasty
I don't get it
A dolphin might
Oh, I see
You guys are inferring that I'm stupid
That's not correct
We were implying it
You then inferred it
Let's go
You know, for a group of guys
who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied,
you can be real jerks
Shame on all of you
What the hell did I do?
You laughed
Good evening
I'm your guest lecturer, Dr Sheldon Cooper
I was expecting applause,
but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate
I agreed to speak to you this evening,
because I was told that you're the best and the brightest
of this university's doctoral candidates
Hmm Of course, that's like saying
you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom
'Cause, you see,
there's only one electron in a hydrogen atom
Best and brightest, my sweet patootie
All right, let's begin
Show of hands, who here is familiar
with the concept of topological insulators?
Don't kid yourselves
I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon's lecture
"Dr Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject
"and managed to make it completely insufferable
Plus, he looks like a giant insect"
Look Listen to this one
"Does Einstein's theory explain why time flies
"when you're having fun,
"but when you're listening to Dr Cooper,
it falls out of the sky, dead?"
Ooh, somebody took pictures
and uploaded them to their Flickr account
Wow
How do you get an entire lecture hall
to flip you off at the same time?
Apparently, if you're Sheldon,
all you need to do is turn your back
Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down?
I can't get on
Oh, Sheldon changed the password
It's now "Penny is a freeloader"
No spaces
Thanks What are you guys doing?
Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight
We're reading the reviews
Oh How'd he do?
Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl
meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2 
That bad, huh?
Read this woman's tweet
"Listening to Dr Cooper
has made me want to start cutting myself again""
Yeah
Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj,
freeloader
So, how'd the lecture go?
In a word, triumphant
Really? Triumphant?
Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people
Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom
I may have changed a few lives today
Oh, please let me tell him
I don't know, I kind of promised Howard
Tell me what?
Actually, we should all share the moment
Raj, if you would
Oh, tweets about my lecture
Hmm
That's rather unfair
That's downright cruel
Plus, insects have six legs
Yeah, I'm not familiar with the acronym "KMN""
From the context, we think it means "kill me now"
Well, I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion
I think I'll turn in
I didn't want to teach those poopy heads, anyway
FYI, I think that's what Darth Vader said
just before he started building the Death Star
Here's what I wonder about zombies
What happens if they can't get any human flesh to eat?
They can't starve to death-- they're already dead
You take this one I spent an hour last night on
"How do vampires shave
when they can't see themselves in the mirror"?
Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs
and shave each other-- case closed
Yeah, okay, so, zombies
I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj
Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies?
Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn't eat, 
they starved You're thinking
of 28 Days Later 
28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab
and puts the audience into an undead state
Hey, don't bag on Sandra Bullock!
You think it makes you look cultured,
but you just come off as bitter
Oh, Dr Siebert, twelve o'clock
Why's the president of the university
slumming in the cafeteria?
Perhaps he's emulating Shakespeare's Henry V,
who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them,
to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects
Of course, if he'd
have read any of the 1,300 e-mails
I've sent him on the subject of his administration,
he could have saved himself the trouble
Or maybe he heard it's Tator Tot Tuesday
That's why I'm here
Hey, there's my favorite geniuses!
How are we doing today?
That depends-- how much longer
do you plan on fondling my shoulder?
Sorry, Dr Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia
It's not a touch phobia, it's a germ phobia
If you'd like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,
I'll let you check me for a hernia
Yeah
So, listen, fellas, who's up for a little party this Saturday night?
Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls
Sounds great! I'm in!
Hold on
Just because the nice man is offering you candy,
doesn't mean you should jump into his windowless van
What's the occasion?
Just a little fund-raiser for the university
Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van
I understand your reticence, Dr Cooper,
and I sympathize, but the hard facts are,
occasionally, we have to shake a few hands
and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research
I don't care; it's demeaning
And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off
like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair
Which, by the way, is something you don't want to attend
wearing a Star Trek ensign's uniform
All right,
let me put it this way
You're gonna put on a suit, you're gonna come to this party,
and you're gonna explain your research
to a bunch of old people,
or I swear to God, I'll blind you with a hot spoon,
like they did to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire 
Oh, you don't want that
So, Saturday night!
It's gonna be off the hook Ugh!
Get over it
Oh, boy!
Tator tots and a party invitation?
What a great day!
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:
Guess who I found at LAX My baby sister Priya
It's really nice to see you again, Leonard
Yeah, it's good to see you, too
Here you go
Thanks
You slept with my sister?!
Yeah
This is a terrible betrayal of my trust!
Would it help if I told you
that I offered her my heart,
and she kinda stomped on it?!
How hard did she stomp?
Very hard
Okay, I'm good
(giggles)
What's so funny?
Nothing Just thinking
about the noises people make during sex
I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don't I?
(chuckles)
It's cute
You sound a little like a drunken monkey
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
You know it's meant as a compliment
That's how I take it
(sighs) This is perfect
I hope this moment never ends
Me, too
(both sigh)
Well, gotta go Oh!
Already? Why don't you stay over?
I'd love to, but you know
my mother needs me in the morning
I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself
It's not just the wig
It's pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows
It's a two-person job
It's just, when you leave right after we make love,
it makes me feel
cheap
Oh, honey, I'm sorry
What can I do?
Stay
Okay
(sighs)
Like, what, another five, ten minutes?
Go home
Your call
Howard
have you ever considered us living together?
Boy, I don't know
You, me, Ma living under the same roof?
No, I mean just you and me
You can move in here,
or we can find a place
I've got a better solution What?
We wait for my mom's heart to explode
from all the salt she eats
Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress
and move into the big bedroom
Great
Look at us planning a future together!
MRS WOLOWITZ: Who's there?!
Are you a sex criminal?!
Sex criminals don't have keys, Ma!
Where were you so late?!
I was out with Bernadette!
I know what that means!
I watch Dr Phil! 
I hope to God you used a condom!
I'm not having this conversation with you, Ma!
God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!
Nobody has a disease!
I hope not!
I share a toilet with you!
Is that what you want?!
To give your mother herbies?!
That's it! I don't have to take this!
Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
Who's there?!
Are you a sex criminal?!
I'm still leaving!
I just forgot my Claritin!
Buona sera, Luigi's Pizza 
Buona sera 
It means good evening in Italian
May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question
the authenticity of your ristorante? 
Okay, I'm out of here
Un momento 
Oh, for heaven's sake
Now you're being deliberately stupid
Where are you going?
I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's
I think Howard's going to be there You want to join us?
But tonight's Thursday
On Thursdays, everybody comes over here
and has pizza
Or a reasonable facsimile
prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi,
but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan
Can't we make a one-time exception for tonight?
We could
We could also stop using the letter "M,"
but I think that idea is isguided and oronic 
Just come with me to Raj's
Well, I don't want to go to a party
It's not a party It's the same group of people
who hang out here hanging out over there
I'm sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party
How come it's not a party when we do it here?
Because we don't throw parties
I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon
I'm going to see Priya Everyone's over there
You coming or not?
Well, no, sir, and do you know why?
In a word: tradition
Every Thursday night for the last eight years,
you and I and our friends have gathered here
in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce,
discuss the issues of the day,
and yes, share a laugh or two
But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you
I guess you're right
- See you later - Wait!
Leonard! Wait!
What am I going to do for dinner?
Come with me to Raj's and eat there
I can't do that
What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
I really doubt that's what he'll serve
But what if he does?
I'll be obliged to dine
on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep's stomach
And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing
I don't know why he's serving both
What do you want to do?
You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?
No, I'll go to your haggis party
But I'm telling you
This is adness This is utter and complete adness 
Morning
Sleep okay?
Mm-hmm Great
Hey, can I ask you something?
Sure
Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out
of the kama Sutra,
was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?
Yeah, just because you're in bed with an Indian woman,
you think that gives you permission
to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?
Hey, if you can find a book called
weird sex with white boys, I'd be okay with that
No, no, you have such beautiful eyes
Have you ever thought about getting contacts?
I tried in the seventh grade
I could never get used to them
Oh, that's too bad
Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been
the coolest debate club president
ever to be stuffed into his own cello case
If you had them on now,
you could see what we're going to do next
Th-that's okay I can infer from context
Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick
I've been working on?
Howard, if I may interject here
with a piece of friendly advice
Is working on magic tricks
really how you want to spend your time?
Granted, you're just an engineer, but
That doesn't mean you might not someday build a geegaw
or a thingamabob that may get you a "thank you"
in someone else's Nobel prize acceptance speech
Is the trick making him disappear?
Sure, let's see it
Here, shuffle these
Okay
Now spread them out on the table face down
Pick one, look at it
Okay
Now remember your card, put it back in the deck
Is it any wonder he doesn't have a doctorate?
Remind me, what's your birthday?
October sixth
Okay, October is the tenth month
So ten one plus zero is one, plus six is seven
Turn over the seventh card
How about that!
Is that your card?
Yes, it is Very cool!
It's not cool
It's a childish trick designed
to confuse and intrigue simpletons
How'd you do it?
A magician never reveals his secrets
But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out
Fine
Give me a second
You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?
Oh, hey! Sorry! Oop!
Sorry! Pardon me! (Screams)
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Oh, that was my fault
Check it out
I just got contacts
Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?
Here Breathe into this bag
What's going on?
They stole everything, Leonard!
Everything
Are you the roommate?
Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter What happened?
Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery
Oh, my God, what did they get?
What didn't they get?
They got my enchanted weapons,
my vicious gladiator armor,
my wand of untainted power,
and all my gold!
You called the police
because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
What choice did I have?
The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf,
hero of the Eastern kingdoms,
has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun
Plus, the FBI hung up on me
Into the bag
They took my battle ostrich!
- Oh, no, not Glenn! - Yes!
Glenn!
The only bird I ever loved
Good luck, fellas
Oh Well, thank you, officer
Wait a minute!
You're not going to do anything?
Mr Cooper, there's nothing
Dr Cooper
Seriously?
Not the kind with access to drugs
Fine Dr Cooper
I'm sorry for your loss,
but the Pasadena Police Department
doesn't have jurisdiction in
Pandora
That's from Avatar! 
World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth
Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun?
Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?
What?
Wh-- you know, one who was drummed off the force
because he refused to play by the rules,
and now he hires himself out
to impose his own brand of rough justice?
No
Thank you, officer
It's all gone All gone
I'm really sorry, Sheldon
What kind of world do we live in,
where a man would take another man's battle ostrich?
I don't know
This act of aggression must be met
with swift and cruel ferocity
It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war
I'm on it
Hi, Mrs Wolowitz Is, is Howard there?
Okay, thanks
That particular dog of war
will have to call you back after his bath
See if Raj is done with Pilates
My new book The Hidden Reality takes on a grand question:
Is our universe the only universe?
You see, there's a growing belief among scientists like me
that ours may only be one among many universes
populating a gigantic cosmos
In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility
without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics
on the part of the reader
Hysterical
I'm glad you talked me into this
We work so hard, sometimes, it's nice to goof off
- and do something silly - Agreed
Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd
You may actually believe you're in a comedy club
You can think about Heisenberg's "Uncertainty Principle"
much like the special order menu
that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have
dishes in column A and other dishes in column B,
and if you order the first dish in column A,
you can't order the corresponding dish in column B
That's sort of like the "Uncertainly Principle"
(water running)
Leonard, are you in the shower?
I can't hear you! I'm in the shower!
I asked if you were in the shower,
but that's moot now!
What?
Moot! Rendered unimportant by recent events!
I can't hear you! I'm in the shower!
I have to skip the chitchat
Emergency
What kind of emergency?
Mathematical-- 32-ounce banana smoothie,
16-ounce bladder
You might not want to do that
I assure you I do
Sheldon, I'm not alone in here
What?!
Hello, Sheldon
What are you doing in there?
She can't be in here!
We were in here first; you can't be in here
According to the roommate agreement,
paragraph nine, subsection B,
"The right to bathroom privacy
is suspended in the event of force majeure"
And believe me, I am experiencing
a very majeure force
Come on, you can't wait two minutes?
Oh, Leonard, let the man pee
Penny? Penny?
Penny?
What?
Move Move Move!
AMY: I must say, Penny, this is great fun
PENNY: Glad you're enjoying yourself
AMY: Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom
had been entirely focused on elimination
Now they have a delightful social aspect
Amy, you must've been in the bathroom
with other women before
(toilet flushes) Of course I have
But they were strangers and seemed off-put
when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat
Some women don't like to get chummy
when their panties are down
You okay in there, bestie?
PENNY: I'm fine
The reason I ask is that many people
experience bladder shyness;
the inability to pass uri
PENNY: Yeah, I said I'm fine Stop talking to me
She always this crabby when she urinates?
We're really not that close
Screw it I'll go later
And I'll be right by your side
Did I tell you Priya invited
me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
Oh, that's nice
No, it's not
It's a strategic maneuver
Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty
to you and the group
That bitch is crafty
- You think? - Of course
How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests?
By going after its weakest member
Well, what makes me the weakest member?
Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body
You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti
Okay, Amy, you're being silly
I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who
And I certainly don't have a problem
with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup
Ooh, these are cute
Of course if I buy them,
I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple
It doesn't matter I'm going to tell her we can't make it
Oh, no You have to go
I don't understand
I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest
You are-- with hair that smells like strawberries
And we're going to use that to our advantage
Wait What are you talking about?
By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes
a double agent inside the enemy camp
She could ferret out Priya's tactics,
identify her weaknesses
and feed her false information, such as:
Leonard's no stranger to back-alley cockfights
I don't know I'm not a very good liar
They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school
Don't worry I'll teach you
I did two years of Cub Scouts
before they found out I was a girl
Okay, I don't know you people
I'm just an innocent woman wondering
if this shoe store will take my Texaco card
How do you feel about concealing a recording device
in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
I don't want anything in my ample bosom
Come on, Strawberries Take one for the team
Hey, do me a favor and take table seven
You mean the one with my 118-pound
rock-hard stud of a fiancé
who's prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend
and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend,
who makes me feel like a toothless Okie
Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
Oh, please-- you're not that kind of person
I know
But if she orders something low-fat
I'll totally give her the full-fat version
Uh, that's my water
What?
My water You're drinking it
D-Dear Lord!
Have you been drinking it?
Yes It's my water
Well, that's it then
I'm dead
Here we go
I'm sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you?
The backwash into this glass
is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home
Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue
of your subtropical girlfriend
Hey! That's my sister
and my country you're talking about
Leonard may have defiled one,
but I won't have you talking smack about the other
You guys ready to order?
Yes, I'd like a seven-day course of penicillin,
some, uh, syrup of ipecac-- to induce vomiting-- and a mint
I don't understand
He drank from Leonard's glass
"He drank from Leonard's glass"--
the words they'll be carving into my tombstone
That's actually my napkin
Oh, this is a nightmare!
Where are you going? To the bar,
to sterilize my mouth with alcohol
Gang way! Dead man walking!
Hey, you guys ready to order?
- Uh, sure - Okay, Priya?
Uh, I'll have the shepherd's pie
You want to split that with me?
Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't
Why not?
Well, you have milk in the taters,
milk in the gravy, parmesan crust
Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn
into a gas-filled Macy's Day balloon
(all laugh)
Not quite accurate The Macy's balloons are filled with helium,
whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane
(all laugh)
(goofy snicker)
So, no, on the shepherd's pie Can we move on?
Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yogurt
Do not believe it
Sea bass! I'll have the sea bass!
You gotta like this,
the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding
over your rooty-tooty stinky booty
(all laugh)
Kill me
It wouldn'help The human body is capable
of being flatulent for hours after death
(snickers)
Guys, sorry I'm late I have amazing news
Bernadette, before you change the subject,
does anyone have any final comments on
Leonard's faulty digestive system?
So, what's your news, Bernadette?
The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation
I'm getting my PhD!
- Wow! - Oh, congratulations
Wow, so that means you're a doctor, you're a doctor,
you're a doctor, you're a doctor,
and Howard, you know a lot of doctors
(chuckling)
Congratulations, honey
Thank you
So, Howard, tell us, how's it feel knowing
that when you two get married,
you'll be referred to as Mr and Dr Wolowitz?
Unless he takes Bernadette's last name
And considering her advanced status,
that could open some doors for him
Please, this isn't about me
- I'm proud of you - Well, you'll be really be proud of this
I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company
They're gonna pay me a buttload of money!
What?
Bernadette, that's great
Howard, do you make a buttload?
Better than what you've got a buttload of
Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything's peachy
If you do it, you're still not a doctor
Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal
It helps, but everything is not "peachy "
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
My brother-- he's got a big crush on Bernadette
You're moving back to India?
What's going on?
(laughs)
It's-It's not what it looks like
What does it look like?
It's not what it looks like
It's not what it looks like
What are you grinding about?
Penny's brain teaser this morning
She and Koothrappali
emerge from your bedroom
She is disheveled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet
The sole clue: "It's not what it looks like"
Just let it go, Sheldon
If I could, I would, but I can't, so I shan't
Now, knowing Penny,
the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus
But
since that's what it looked like,
we can rule that out
Let's put on
our thinking cap, shall we?
Raj is from India, a tropical country
Third World hygiene
Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms
Mm-hmm The procedure
for diagnosing pinworms is to wait
until the subject is asleep,
and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air
Yes, just like that
Penny could have been
inspecting Raj's anal region for parasites
Oh, boy
That's a true blue friend
They slept together, Sherlock
No, you weren't listening
She said it's not what it looks like
She lied
Oh
Don't I look silly sitting here wearing this?
What are you doing?
Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype,
and we are gonna have a dinner date
It's 8:00 in the morning in Mumbai
How can she have dinner?
Fine, whatever
Priya will be having breakfast
All right, so technically it's not a dinner date
I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date
But if you did, you'd open yourself
to peer-based mocking, such as,
"Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"
That doesn't sound like mocking
You didn't let me finish
Dinfast
Are those soy-based candles?
I don't know Why?
Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens
Unless lung cancer is the ambiance
you were going for at your dinfast
Dinfast
Listen, I don't want to be rude,
but Priya's gonna be calling any minute, so
Oh, yes, Priya
Leonard, you know I make a point of
never interfering in your personal affairs
Yes, I've always admired that about you
As well you should
But I'm going to make an exception here
Oh, good
Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career
Instead of desperately trying
to keep this intercontinental relationship alive,
you could use that time to take up a hobby
A hobby?
Yes
I read recently about a fellow in Kansas
with an enormous ball of twine
I bet you could give him a run for his money
You know, some people might say that it's great
that we're trying to make things work long distance
They'd say things like,
"Love is stronger than the miles between you""
When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized
You video-chat with Amy all the time
How is this different?
Don't you like Amy?
Of course I like Amy
Well, there's the difference
(Skype ringtone playing)
Excuse me, that's Priya
Hi, Leonard
Hey, honey
I miss you
Oh, I miss you, too
I miss the old days when your romantic partners
could be returned to the video store
Thanks for letting me stay here
while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend
Oh, it's no problem
It's actually kind of nice
You reading, me reading
We're like an old married couple
If we were an old married couple,
the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles
I don't have iced tea and snickerdoodles
A good wife would go to the store
I want a divorce
Good On the way to see the lawyer,
pick up some tea and cookies
(both chuckle)
I must say, I am enjoying your new chair
It's great, isn't it?
It is
Aligns the lumbar,
cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks
This is a chair worthy of the name
What name?
Chair
Oh, all right, well, I'm glad you like it
I mean, I still can't get over the fact
someone just threw it away
What?
Yeah, it was just sitting on the street
I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here
(groans)
Oh, dear Oh, dear
What is wrong?
I've been sitting in garbage!
Sheldon, take it easy
You take it easy! I need to use your shower
I went into this marriage with so much hope
There's a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor!
Who wants the last dumpling?
Ooh, me!
Penny, a moment
We just had Thai food
In that culture, the last morsel is called
the "greng jie" piece, and it is reserved for
the most important and valued member of the group
Thank you all for this high honor
I've seen pictures of your mother; keep eating
All right, honey, if we're gonna make the movie, we should go
This may be hard for you to hear,
but when I say "honey," I mean my fiancée
Yeah, well, now it means her
It's okay if he wants to come
Fine But next time, we get a sitter
All right, I got to go to work I'll walk down with you
Wait
Which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia,
the movie theater or The Cheesecake Factory?
Neither of them are close
Oh, well, then I guess it doesn't matter which one
of you drives me
Let's play a fun guessing game
to see who gets to take me
All right, this four-letter word describes either
a printer's type size or a compulsion to eat dirt
Okay, I'm not driving him
Penny, don't give up, you can get this
Aren't you going with Sheldon?
No, I have no interest in model trains,
stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele
Oh
Well, I have some work to do, so
I can't imagine that would disturb me
Carry on
Okay
Wouldn't you be more comfortable at home?
Not really, no
All righty then
Guess I'll just get started
Leonard, please I don't need the running commentary
"The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door
"You manage to open it only to find yourself
"face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling,
moss-covered ogre"
What do you do?
I say, "Hey, Ma, what's for dinner?"
Seventeen
The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass
By the by, I liked it, too
How go the wedding plans, Howard?
Great We spent five hours last night
at Macy's registering for gifts
Looks like I'm finally going to have
that darling little earthenware asparagus dish
I've always wanted
See, this is the good thing
about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away
I can spend my nights doing whatever I want
You mean like playing nerd games with us
and then taking a suspiciously long shower?
Maybe
We enter the dungeon
You see a dragon
Really? So we're playing Dungeons & Dragons
and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon?
Isn't that a little on the nose?
When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain
about all the chutes and all the ladders?
Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
Maybe Why not?
Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?
No, it's just that everybody's got someone
Sheldon's with Amy, Howard's getting married,
you're dating my sister
Now that Howard's getting married,
maybe he'll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you
You know who I blame for my loneliness?
The United States of America
Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved
with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas
Eat another pie, you'll have your own bazongas
That's cruel
You know it goes straight to my hips
Gentlemen, please focus
You're facing a fire-breathing dragon
I don't know if I want to play anymore
Because you don't have a girlfriend?
Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not
to play Dungeons & Dragons, this game's in serious trouble
It's from Game of Thrones 
What do you think?
I don't know
If we're going to start a fantasy sword collection--
and I've long thought we should--
is this really the sword to start with?
What did you have in mind?
Well, off the top of my head, I'd have to go with Excalibur
It gives you the right to rule England
It would be a replica of a movie prop
Fair enough
It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England
Well, they don't have an Excalibur here,
so what do you want to do?
Mm Tough decision
There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings 
forged in a Chinese sweatshop?
Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there
Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger; wouldn't we look silly?
Okay, let's go for it
Oh, I see you guys have
found my little treasure
Yeah
It's okay, I guess
Okay? It's magnificent
Buh-buh-buh-buh!
What do you want for it?
Oh, it's hard to put a price on something
that's a copy of something that was on pay cable
But for my friends, let's say 250?
Oh, that's pretty steep
Well, it's a limited edition
They only made 8,000 of these bad boys
Only 8,000?
We're wasting precious time Buy it
Hang on
Can you do any better?
Are you kidding?
I'm already giving you the friends and family discount
Oh, did you hear that?
We're getting the friends and family discount
We are honored and we will take it
Slow down
Two hundred
What are you doing?
250 is already the discounted price
Will you shut up?
Tell you what, I'll go 235
Nope Maybe another time
Okay, 225-- my final offer
Take it, take it
Two hundred
Man, you're killing me!
Killing you? I can't breathe
210, and I'm losing money
Oh, now, we can't let him lose money, Leonard I'm so sorry
210 and you throw in the Iron Man helmet
Are you crazy?
That helmet's signed by Robert Downey Jr
So?
Okay, if you're going to question
the importance of an actor's signature on a plastic helmet
from a movie based on a comic book,
then all of our lives have no meaning!
Okay, fine
Just the sword, 210
Thank you
I can eat meat this week
See that?
I just saved us 40 bucks
I've long said, what you lack in academic knowledge
you make up for in street smarts
You want me to wrap it?
No, it's okay
I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest
Hey, Stuart
Ah, hey, Wil
Hello, Wil Wheaton
Hi, Sheldon
Nice sword
It's part of my sword collection
- Do you have a sword collection? - No
I'm not surprised
Here's the Batman 612
with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted
Awesome What do I owe you?
40 bucks
Good deal
Sucker
Didn't even ask for the friends and family discount
Hey, I'm having a party at my house on Friday,
and I was hoping you would stop by
Will there be girls there?
Yeah, of course
'Cause there wasn't last time
There will be girls
You guys are invited if you want to come by
Thank you
All right, great
Later
I see what you're doing
You accept an invitation
to a party at the home of my sworn enemy,
he tells everyone we're going to be there,
and when we don't show, he looks the fool
Fiendishly clever
I was actually thinking about going
And then declaring the party a fiasco
and storming out, leaving him humiliated
in front of his guests
Love it
No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time
Oh, great, more guys
It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest
So what kind of cruise is this you're going on?
It's called the Born Again Boat Ride
Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating--
five thorny crowns
I do wish you'd come with me, Sheldon
Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof
that your God can work miracles
You're missing out
It's gonna be wall-to-wall fun
It's all themed
There's Jonah and the Whale Watching
All-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet
And my personal favorite, Gunning with God
What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask
Oh, it is a hoot and a half
You write your sins on a clay pigeon,
they fire 'em up in the air, and you pulverize them
with a 12-gauge shotgun
full of our Lord's forgiveness
Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see how advanced
your group has become-- willing to sail out
into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge
For example,
if Shelly was aboard, he'd write,
"Smart mouth" on his pigeon,
and then bam!
The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away
Well, Mom,
according to my itinerary for our weekend together,
the fun begins with fried chicken Sounds delicious
Good, 'cause I got you everything you need to make it
You are in for a treat
My mother's fried chicken
is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin
Sheldon, she just got off the plane
She doesn't want to cook
Of course she does
Making me food is her way of saying "I love you"
Making me food when she's too tired to cook
is her way of saying "I really love you"
Actually, I wouldn't mind going out for a bite, Sheldon
Won't that spoil our appetites
for the chicken you're going to make me?
All right, that settles it, we're going out
Do you like sushi? There's a great little place down the street
I've never had it, but there's no harm in trying something new
There's a lot of harm in trying something new
That's why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits
Sheldon, you're talking like a crazy person
Actually, I had him tested as a child
Doctor says he's fine
Told you
Although, I do regret not following up
with that specialist in Houston
** Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state **
** Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait! **
** The Earth began to cool **
** The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools **
** We built the Wall ** ** We built the pyramids ** 
** Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery **
** That all started with a big bang **
** Bang! ** 
The Big Bang Theory S05E06 "The Rhinitis Revelation"
Subtituloses == DIFUNDE LA PALABRA ==
Irasshaimase!
Stop yelling!
I'm not happy about this
What's the last thing you were ever happy about?
The prospect of fried chicken
This is exciting
Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi,
but it's just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben's
They put it on the menu
in those kung fu letters, but that don't make it sushi
Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct
Oh, I thought the one we couldn't say was "ching chong"
Yeah, yeah, that, too
So, Shelly, what's up
with you and your friend Amy,
if you don't mind a mother prying a bit?
Well, there's actually big news on the Amy front
She's been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals
She's this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine
Do you have any idea what's going on with those two?
It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster
Maybe there's something there, maybe there isn't We'll probably never know
But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it
How are you doing on the young lady front?
I hear you're in some sort of a long distance situation?
Yeah, it's Raj's sister
It's kind of tough
She's in India
Also, her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white
Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it?
You never think about it going the other way
Well, you can't force things
You need to figure out if you're in a relationship
or if you're just calling it one
It's like they say--
a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don't make 'em biscuits
And that reminds me of another saying
You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can't make your mother fry it
Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken,
I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant
Please pester her Please, for me
So, Mrs Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?
It was good
The only thing that would have made it better
is if it was cooked
and if it was beef
Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?
I don't know
Lately we've been talking about
converting it into a missile silo
Your son seems to think
we need to launch a preemptive strike on Burbank
Get them before they get us
Hey, look who decided to show up
Raj, what are you doing?
I couldn't find you guys so I bought six new friends
Three, sadly, are dead
Mom, you remember Rajesh?
Rajesh, my mother Of course
Mrs Cooper So nice to see you again
Well, it's so nice to see you, too
I thought it was our Indians
that had the occasional alcohol problem
We don't say that, either
I'll make you a list
Oh, that would be mighty white of you
So, Raj, what pain are you trying
to cover up with alcohol?
Nothing, I'm fine Are ya?
No
That's better
Now tell me what's bothering you
I'm so lonely
Oh, yes, born alone, die alone
It's a tragic human condition
Now, Raj,
if you'll excuse my mother,
she's about to make a pecan pie
that'll be so good I'll almost forget
how she blew it with the fried chicken
Sheldon, your friend is hurtin'
What do we do when someone's hurtin'?
Offer them a hot beverage
And when they're drunk as a skunk,
what beverage do we offer?
Coffee
And what do we do it with?
Now you listen to me
I know you feel like you can't find someone,
but there's a lock for every key
Back home, there's a girl
works at the Wal-Mart Tall, tall girl
Woman could hunt geese with a rake
Thought she'd never
find a man, then one day, wouldn't ya know,
Harlem Globetrotters come to town
Long story short,
today that woman travels the world
with a semi-professional basketball player
and two beautiful mixed-race babies
I didn't get a lot of that because of your accent,
but the general tone was soothing
and somehow I feel better
I'm not going to get my pecan pie, am I?
You want some Oreos?
Double Stuf? No, regular
Nice Kick a man when he's down
I'm glad we're finally getting to do something together,
just the two of us
Sure One thing you really miss when you're on vacation is laundry
Careful, you're using too much Downey
You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy
Well, this takes me back
Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing
It is nice, isn't it?
Mrs Cooper
Hi! Oh, hello, darlin'
Sheldon, you didn't tell me your mom was coming
It was in my weekly e-mail blast
Right between
"Beet season is finally here"
and "Uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare"
So, how've you been?
Good, good
I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend
How are you doing with all that?
Oh, fine You know, it's been a while
I'm getting back out there
Let me ask you, when you get back out there,
are you wearing this?
Well, it's super cute on
That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost
Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up
in promiscuity futures
Hon, you think
maybe the reason why you're having trouble
finding a guy to settle down with
is because you're letting them ride the roller coaster
without buying a ticket?
Oh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster
Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups
Now I'm going out tonight Would it be crazy
to ask you to look at the outfit I'm going to wear?
Oh, not crazy at all
And don't beat yourself up
When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride
and a bottle of strawberry wine
That will not be in this week's e-mail blast
So, this spring, I get to go
to the International Space Station
Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens
If you ever want to live there eternally,
I've got a good book you could read
Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special
every year, so I get the gist
I bet your mom is really proud of you
Nope
She says if I don't back out
she's going to go on a hunger strike
It would take years before
she'd be in any kind of danger, but still
I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom
I'm taking you
to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture
about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology
And the best part is,
at the Q and A afterward,
I've worked up a couple of "Q's"
that will stump his sorry "A"
I don't know, Shelly
I thought we could do a little sightseeing
What sight is better than your little boy
embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
Come on, Sheldon, we'll take your mom
to see the Hollywood sign,
the wax museum, the Walk of Fame
Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive
Well, I can't spend $12,000 on a handbag,
but it's free to look upon those
who do with righteous condemnation
What do you say?
What do I say?
I say you people need to stop ruining my mom's visit
with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts
Stop it
He's not talking about your shirt Your shirt is fine
These are delicious
The trick to pancakes is bacon grease
I cook everything in it
Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?
Oh, doctors are always changing their mind
One week bacon grease is bad for you
The next week we're not getting enough of it
Good morning, Shelly
Mom, I want to apologize for my behavior last night
Apology accepted Great
Now, you're going to love the Perlmutter lecture
Look, he will be stating that the universe is older
than 6,000 years, but I thought
you could stick your fingers in your ears
and hum "Amazing Grace" during those parts
I am still going out with your friends
But I apologized
And that was hard for me because I didn't do anything wrong
Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls
while you were growing up
I want to go sightseeing
So why don't you have some pancakes,
get dressed and come with us
I'm not going, and you can't make me
You're right, I can't Have a nice day
Well, I'm going to stand here until you change your mind
Well, then you are going to stand there all day
I'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there
I can't believe my own mother is abandoning me
I am not abandoning you
Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket
on a church doorstep
I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan
for his service to our country
We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother
Well, I guess we are
Sorry Syrup
All right, Mom
When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum,
if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance
to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son,
believe it, because it's true
I hadn't
That lecture was a waste of time
I made more accurate diagrams
of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall
with the contents of my diaper
Are you getting sick?
No, I'm just allergic to people
who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason
Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood--
or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness--
is because your mother isn't making you a priority?
No Or to use the clinical term, "nuh-uh"
Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond
is the building block of primate psychology
Oh, there it is
It always comes back to monkeys with you
Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys
Sheldon, we're all animals
And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary,
but when it comes to emotions and relationships,
you're just like everybody else
Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems
are no different than those of a stupid person?
Actually, some research indicates
that by not overthinking,
the less intelligent handle emotions better
Sure you're not coming down with a cold?
Oh, yes, the common cold
Just like everyone else
You'd love that, wouldn't you?
Oh, this one's sweet
You know, for your rosary rattlers
Mrs Cooper, we say "Catholics," not "rosary rattlers"
My goodness, it's a wonder you people in California
can talk at all
This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever
What are we gonna do? She wanted to see churches
Hey, they have wine here, don't they?
None of our gods have abs like that
Yep, that's the last Jew who did sit-ups
And look where it got him
Hey, while we're here, why don't we all do some praying?
Let's put a little church in this church
Oh, I'm not sure we should
It's easy I'll show you how
Lord, Mary Cooper here
Coming to you from Gomorrah, California
I want to thank you
for the blessing that is my little Shelly
I also want to thank you for the continued strength
not to coldcock him with my Bible
All right, Penny, your turn
Okay, um
Hey, God
What's up?
Um, I'm good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family
if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth
But no cops Be cool
She also goes a little overboard on the "love thy neighbor"
Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene
Leonard, you're up
Wasserman, you're on deck
Okay I don't know
it's probably a little late to ask you to make me taller
Oh, um if you could help out with me and my girlfriend
She's all the way in India That would be great
Hear that? Girl trouble
Turns out we were both wrong on that front
How about you?
Oh, me? No Thanks, I'm good
I'm really just trying not to burst into flames
Rajesh?
He says he's having trouble dropping those last five pounds
Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing
No, you only get one wish
Look at the two of us
Me, a highly regarded physicist
The kind of mind that comes along once,
maybe twice in a generation
You, the common man,
tired from your labors as a stockbroker,
or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack
But deep down inside
apparently we're just two peas in a pod
A regular pea,
and the kind of pea that comes along once,
maybe twice in a generation
Rain
Another great equalizer
Falling on the head of the brilliant
and the unremarkable alike
Smarty-pants
Oh, Mrs Cooper, it smells so good
You take notes, darlin'
The real way to get a man is with melted cheese
and cream of mushroom soup
He'll die at 50 but his love will be true
I need a tissue This one got wet
Here
Thank you Yeah, I've learned something today
You and I, in so many ways,
other than intelligence and what counts, we're the same
Sweetheart, are you sick?
I hope so, because if this is well, life isn't worth living
Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up
We've got to get you to bed Okay
Don't worry Mama's here to take care of her baby
And just to be clear, only her baby
and not these other people
Of course
Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
You can have whatever you want
Thanks, Mom You're the best
Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you,
you didn't have hair on your chest
I know, it filled in last year
I didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit
And whose fault was that?
Yours
Shelly, you're not eight years old anymore
We have to have a different relationship
No, we don't
The one we have works great
Sweetheart, you are a grown man
Or maybe I'm part of a new species,
that lives for hundreds of years,
which means I'm still basically a toddler
Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston
Does this mean you're not going to sing "Soft Kitty"?
No, I will always sing you "Soft Kitty"
** Soft kitty, warm kitty **
** Little ball of fur **
Mrs Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?
Get out!
Well, that was rude
Well, I know, but he means well
Sing
** Happy kitty, sleepy kitty **
What are you trying to pull, Mom?
From the top
This is what I'm talking about
** Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur **

Sheldon
Hmm
(electrical crackling, popping)
All right, all right
I see what's going on
A little pre-Halloween hijinkery
(moaning, chains rattling, cackling)
A ghostly moan,
a rattling of chains,

The trifecta of haunted house clichés
Instead of "Eek," I say, "Yawn"

Oh, the walls are dripping blood,
which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator
exposed to a sodium carbonate solution

The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma
Ah
Okay, all right
That one was clever
Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line
Come on out, merry pranksters
Take a bow
(laughing)
You should've seen your face
Yes, there's nothing quite like
the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled
Come on, admit it We got you, Sheldon
Please, fright depends on an element of surprise
The simple fact is,
because I am much smarter than you,
and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely
that you two rubes could ever surprise me
He's probably right
We can't beat him He's just too smart

Well, if you don't mind looking like

AMY: Girlfriends, I have the answer
to our dress problems
BERNADETTE: Really?
AMY: 12 years ago, my cousin Irene
and her entire family died
in a horrific carbon monoxide accident
the night before her wedding
That's horrible
Yes and no
All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused
and available to us for free
So it seems
that cloud of odorless deadly gas
had a silver lining after all
Check it out,
still in the bags
The gowns, not the bridesmaids
I don't know
Dead people's dresses?
Yeah, and cap sleeve
Eh
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't notice
Irene was always a slave to a good bargain
when it came to clothes,
and sadly as it turned out, space heaters
Ladies, please
These four walls once housed an intellectual salon
where the mind received nourishment
as well as the stomach
But through no one's fault, Penny,
the quality of dinner conversation
in this apartment has declined
And again, I'm looking at no one in particular, Penny
Fine
What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?
"What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?"
Why do you hate us?
I've prepared a number of topics
that should appeal to both the advanced
and novice conversationalists
Okay, that time you looked at me
Who didn't?
Your skin is like alabaster
Do you even have pores?
SHELDON: Topic one:
"Faster-than-light particles at CERN--
"paradigm-shifting discovery
or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese?"
And converse
PENNY: All right, who wants to go
to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?
Oh, me
Through no one's fault, Sheldon, we're leaving
Wait for moi 
You're leaving?
Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I'm a lady
And with that comes
an estrogen-fueled need to page through
thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body
New topic: women
Delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?
Totally
What's wrong with cap sleeves?
If you have the right figure for it, they're adorable
It's amazing people keep coming
to comic book stores
instead of just downloading comics digitally
It's probably for the best
For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here
is the only chance their mom has to go down
to the basement and change their sheets
Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight Yay
Well?
What do you think of New Comic Book Night?
Magic, huh?
Sheldon, I'm disappointed
As a brilliant man,
you're entitled to a vice
I could understand frequenting an opium den
or hunting your fellow man for sport
But this? Lame-o
Well, A) Comic books employ storytelling
through sequential art,
an medium that dates back 17,000 years
to the cave paintings of Lascaux,
and B) You play the harp
Like that's cool
Can I help you find anything?
A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom
can't be used as a flotation device
Sorry Most of the guys
who come in here like big boobs
Couple of them have big boobs
Hey, look, the new
Warlords of Ka'a expansion pack is out
A new one? Unbelievable
They just keep making up more cheesy monsters,
slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop
It's like a secret tax on guys who can't get laid
They're not even trying
Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant?
Why, absurd
What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell?
What could an elephant
possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?
"Wild West and Witches"?
What kind of loser cares about a showdown
between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?
A total loser
Obviously, a guy with a six-shooter
beats an old man with a magic wand
Well, h-hold on
Uh, what if the wizard casts
a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?
What? Please!
This is Billy the Kid we're talking about
I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes
before he could ever get out the words,
"What the hell is Billy the Kid doing
in the mystic realm of Ka'a?"
Leonard
What's the deal with Sheldon's friend Amy?
Are they a couple?
Couple of weirdos Why?
You interested in Amy?
Well, I mean, she didn't look through me
with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling
hatred and contempt
I like that in a woman
Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?
Sure I guess
Stuart, settle an argument for us
Who would win,
Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?
If I tell you that,
I'm robbing you of the hours of fun you could have
for the magical, rootin'-tootin' low price of $2495
I'll take one
Mm make it two
I hate all of you and myself Three
I'll ring it up
Like shooting nerds in a barrel
The Big Bang Theory S05E10 "The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition"
By Mikhel for Subtituloses ==SPREAD THE WORD==
Hey, can I talk to you about something?
It's a little awkward
I know what this is about
Given the professional standstill you're at,
you're wondering if this is the appropriate time
to abandon your research and focus on teaching
Yes
And if I may suggest,
consider changing disciplines
Yeah, to the humanities perhaps history
One of the advantages of teaching history
is that you don't have to create things
You know, you just have to remember
stuff that happened and then parrot it back
You could have fun with that
Yeah, that's not it
Stuart's kind of interested in Amy
Oh, of course he is She's very interesting
Did you know, when she was 14,
she severed the webbing between her own toes?
No
He wanted me to find out
if you'd have a problem with him asking her out
I'm not sure how to respond, Leonard
I don't own Amy
Can't own a person
At least not since
1863
President Lincoln freed the
Slaves! Come on, Leonard,
if you're going to teach history,
these are the kind of facts you'll have to know
You know what? Never mind
I'm going to tell him it's okay to ask her out
The question is moot
There is no way that Stuart,
an impoverished peddler of picture books,
would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler,
a noted neurobiologist
capable of performing surgery on her own feet
with nothing but nitrous oxide
from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia
All right, but for the record,
I checked in with you to see how you'd feel about it
Fine The record shall so reflect
Now, getting back to the problem at hand,
what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist
I am not washed-up
Oh, Leonard
Lots of people love you and want to help you,
but they can't until you admit the problem
Well, ladies, we killed the bottle
I had half a glass
I didn't have any
Okay, don't judge me
So, what do you want to do
go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?
Or we play Travel Twister
Amy, really? Twister?
Excuse me I've passed many
an enjoyable evening playing this game
And I'm sure it's a lot more exciting
when you play with other people
What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins
I'm shirts Called it
I'm too small for Twister
And roller coasters
And sitting with my feet on the floor
Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom
Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot
when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine
Hey, look, I have peach schnapps
Thank God
Guys, something happened
What's wrong?
I think a boy likes me
"Hi It's Stuart
"We met at the comic book store
"I was wondering if you'd like
"to get coffee sometime
"It's okay if you say no
"It might be the kick in the pants I need
to start taking Zoloft"
Amy, little vixen
Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester
What are you going to do?
Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?
Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend;
she has a Sheldon
So do you like Stuart?
I don't know
He's nice
He's funny
He has the sallow, drawn countenance
associated with an overactive thyroid gland
That's kind of hot
Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon,
but you've been with him over a year now
If it's not going anywhere,
what does it hurt to look around?
Well, yeah, I guess they're not engaged
like me and Howie
Yeah, for what it's worth,
engaged people can look around, too
Lot of options out there
Where's Stuart?
Out
Who are you?
I'm Dale
He left me in charge
Really?
Yeah
I don't get it, either
I want to return this "Wild West and Witches"
Ka'a expansion pack
Sorry I don't do returns
They're hard
Sure, sure
Uh, when will Stuart be back?
I don't know He went out for coffee
With a girl
Oh, I guess I was wrong
You okay?
Am I okay?
Leonard, I'm on a lifelong trajectory
that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me,
all four wisdom teeth
fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction,
and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule
Am I okay?
I'm okay, too!
Wild Bill Witchcock
A tribe of Abra-Comanches
Flaming Spittoon
And for the record,
I'm very disappointed in you cowpokes
We're playing our inaugural round
of "Wild West and Witches,"
and I'm the only one who bothered
to dress for the occasion
Patooie
We're not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon
It looks ridiculous
And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?
- Very - Incredibly so
Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack
and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
- Very - Incredibly so
All right, fine Let's just play
We should go easy on him
Amy's out with Stuart tonight
Wait a minute
Are you telling me that Sheldon's patented blend
of condescension and no sex
isn't enough to hold on to a woman?
Cluck, cluck, cluck
What are we, ladies at a quilting bee?
Or are we men playing a fantasy card game
set in a magical frontier town?
Sorry
Creepy Tepee
Annie Ogly
Hocus Pocus Pocahontas
And may I point out it is the three of you
who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me
I think you need to ask yourselves
who's really being ridiculous here
- It's you - You are - Totally you
Hey, guys, check it out
The deluxe limited edition "Wild West and Witches"
expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector's tin
Come on, no!
We just bought the regular pack
Ooh, a sheriff's badge
Yeah, it's also a wand
With a hologram? Nice!
Hey, do you see this?
I'm in the matrix, Leonard; I see everything
You got to be kidding me
You friended Stuart on Facebook?
I thought you didn't like Facebook anymore
Don't be silly
I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact
Please
You're looking at Facebook to find out how their date went
Really?
You think I care if a man, what,
"shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady"?
You're so full of it
You are free to believe
whatever you like
And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali
You unfriended me? Seriously?
Oh, yeah
Now he's gonna miss all those great updates like,
"I can't believe I waited this long
to make my own potpourri"
Sheldon, why don't you just acknowledge
that you have feelings for Amy
and you don't want her going out with other men?
And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter
Here's a radical thought
Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight
I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter
than two skinny white guys
swatting at each other with their eyes closed
And unfriend Howard Wolowitz
That's all of us
Can I use the laptop? Why?
I have to buy that stupid collector's tin
- Who do we love? - Penny
Who do we love? Penny
Who do we love? Penny
Hello, Sheldon
Come on in
Thank you
What's up?
I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me
I'm sorry, what?
A date
You and me
Dining, dancing,
perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight
God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?
No
Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart?
Whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes
or intercourse tonight
Okay, listen to me
Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back
I am not trying to get her back
But, out of curiosity, what is a way?
All right, honey, let me tell you a story
There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt
Eventually, he started going out with someone else,
and I always regretted it
Do you see where I'm going with this?
I believe I do
Mm
I'm the guy
You're not the guy
Are you sure?
That would explain so much
Your constant presence in my apartment,
that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me,
the way you call me
"sweetie" all the time
I call everyone "sweetie"
You tramp
Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying is
strap on a pair and go talk to Amy
"Strap on a pair"?
Of what, skates?
Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy
If you're bored, you can go
I understand
No, I'm having a nice time
Don't patronize me
Excuse me Excuse me
Pardon me
Pardon me Excuse me
Hi, Stuart
Hi, Sheldon
Pardon me Excuse me
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
The thought of you sitting in a darkened theater
with a character like Stuart is repellent
No offense, Stuart
None taken
Although "repellent" is kind of a kind of a strong word
I'm sorry this causes you discomfort,
but based on the currently established parameters
of our relationship, I can put myself
in any repellent situation I want
Um, again
Stuart, please You're being rude
Anything else?
I believe I would like to alter
the paradigm of our relationship
I'm listening
With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever,
physical or otherwise,
I would not object to us
no longer characterizing you as "not my girlfriend"
Interesting
Now try it without the quadruple negative
You're being impossible
Hi, Stuart
Fine
Amy will you be my girlfriend?
Yes
Well, that's enough of that
Sorry to interrupt
You two enjoy your date
Here's a dollar for your troubles
Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids
Excuse me Excuse me Pardon me
Excuse me Pardon me
So, other than you taking your relationship
to the next level with another guy, this was nice
Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door
Oh, you're welcome
Amy Amy Amy
Let's wrap things up out there
Um, good night, Stuart
Good night
Take the hint, Stuart
The lady said "Good night"
How did you get into my apartment?
Wow Is that the kind of nagging I can expect
now that you're my girlfriend?
Good thing I drew this up
What's that?
I present to you the relationship agreement
A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages,
enumerates, iterates and codifies
the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper,
here and after known as "the boyfriend,"
and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as "the girlfriend"
It's so romantic
Mutual indemnification always is
Why don't you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp
"Section 5: Hand-holding
"Hand-holding is only allowed
"under the following circumstances
A) Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff,
"precipice or ledge;
"B) Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake
"after winning a Nobel Prize;
C) Moral support during flu shots"
Seems a bit restrictive
Feel free to retain a lawyer
Penny, I said "right hand red"
Yeah, I heard you
I got red
Bernadette, left foot yellow
We should play limbo next
No one beats me at limbo
Penny Amy Bernadette
That's my boyfriend
It's open!
I got a splinter
What do you want me to do about it?
Relationship agreement Section 4: Boo-boos and Ouchies
You have to take care of it
I should've gotten a lawyer
Looks like it's just us playing
Penny?
Penny, we're out of wine!
You should probably drive

Hi Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?
Yeah, it's "Penny already eats our food
She can pay for Wi-Fi"
No spaces
Okay
If you can't get me to stop eating your food,
what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?
I believe that you're capable of great change
Like when I finally got you to stop saying "Valentimes Day""
You want to hear something weird?
Sure
In the year 2000,
Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter
What are you talking about?
You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird
Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her
Oh
I thought it was a game
What's yours?
There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman,
who used to torment me in high school
He sent me a message through Facebook
He's in town and wants to have drinks
Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices
An e-mail from an old acquaintance,
or the head of one of the largest religious institutions
in the world slam dunking to "Sweet Georgia Brown" Pick
Just do it, 'cause he's not gonna let it go
Basketball Pope
And that's how it's done
What are you gonna do about your bully?
- Are you gonna see him? - I don't know
Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?
No, that was a different guy
Was he the one who wedgied you so hard,
your testicle reascended,
and you spent your whole Christmas break
waiting for it to come back down?
No, that was a different, different guy
Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
No
Oh, oh, oh
Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?
No, but, actually,
that was this guy's sister
All right, well, what do you think he wants?
I don't know
You know, the holidays are just around the corner
Maybe he wants to see
if he can lodge the other testicle up there
I told you That was a different guy
Hmm That's too bad We could have spent
New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop
Completely empty box visit tvshowslatestblogspotcom
If you'd like to examine it
Mm-hmm Yep
I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood
Little snarky there, Cello Lessons
And we have this completely ordinary cylinder
If you'd like to examine it
Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential
Oh, dear Lord
A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels
and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader,
only to emerge and discover his apartment
has been transformed into a cabaret
Sheldon, he's just
practicing for his cousin's birthday party
As I was saying
empty box, empty cylinder,
and ooh!
(whispers): Voila
I'm telling you, dude, there's a seat
on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it
This is how you're going to entertain
your little cousin and his friends?
By lying to them?
(chuckles): How is this lying?
A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition
"This is an ordinary top hat"
"You've chosen that card freely"
"I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister"
KOOTHRAPPALI: Can't you
just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon?
Why must you peek behind the curtain?
Or up the butt?
If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children
by telling them that rabbits
come out of hats, then we create adults
who believe in astrology and homeopathy
and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern 
than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion
Sheldon,
he's just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids
I really don't think they're gonna end up
liking the Green Lantern movie
Don't be so hard on him
It's natural to be a little cranky when you have
(grunts): a quarter in your ear!
Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement
When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose
(laughter)
Wait-wait-wait, how is that not amusing?
It's still there
Takes me
45 minutes to get through airport security
Look, I made Sheldon disappear Ta-da
Next time, you should open with that
You feel like trying something new for dinner?
Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?
You ever wonder how humans would be different
if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
Okay, let's talk about that
As you know, lizards-- cold-blooded animals--
lack the ability to sense temperature
But they do move more sluggishly when it's cold
So, lizard weathermen would say things like,
"Bring a sweater, it's slow outside"
I love my mind
We all do
Now, how about dinner?
Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects or smaller lizards
We could also pull each other's tails off and grill them;
they'll just grow back
Oh!
My life-size cardboard Mr Spock is here!
I know he wouldn't care for an outburst of human emotion,
but, oh, goodie, oh, goodie, oh, goodie
Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded
Excuse me
Permission granted, Commander
Which is why the more intelligent the monkey,
the more feces they fling
(knocks) Excuse me, Amy
Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?
Why, you guys going somewhere?
No, I mean just you and me
You mean, like a date?
Not like a date, a date
Ooh! Ooh!
Um o-okay
Sure
Ooh! Ooh!
SHELDON: Oh, no!
They sent the wrong Spock!
Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto

This is so exciting
If Leonard and Penny get back together,
Howard and I can go on double dates with them
How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?
Mm, uh
How's it going in there, Penny?!
PENNY: Just a sec
Too much?
Yes No
Okay, just hang on
You just can't handle her raw sexuality, can you?
When did you and Leonard break up?
Uh, about two years ago
Why do you think he asked you out again?
I don't know
Maybe he's dying
That would be so romantic
He's not dying
Too bad
If he were, she could just throw him in bed
and ride him right up until he flatlines
How about this?
Maybe Come on
Yeah, okay, no
Do you think you'll sleep with him tonight?
PENNY: Absolutely not
Look, we're just gonna have dinner
and, you know, see how it goes
If he were dying, would you sleep with him?
What?!
Assuming he were dying of something
that couldn't be sexually transmitted
You know, like a spear wound to the head
Okay, he is not dying
How do you know? Are you a doctor?
You can make-believe, though
Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up
and I'm a sexy cardiologist
And the naughty part is I'm not in his HMO network
Screw it I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this
It's just dinner
With a dead man
(growls playfully)
Amy, stop it
Oh, God, I'm so nervous
BERNADETTE: Relax
You know Leonard's always been crazy about you
It's gonna be great
I know, but we've finally gotten to a place
where we can hang out without it being weird
And what if something goes wrong? Then what?
Guess it'll just be Sheldon and me
going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette
Sure, we'd love that
Change your clothes; we got a lot riding on this
Mm
I want to build a road,
but I need wood
Do either of you fellows have wood?
I don't understand the laughter
The object of Settlers of Catan
is to build roads and settlements
To do so requires wood
Now, I have sheep; I need wood
Who has wood for my sheep?
(both laughing)
Okay, how do I look?
More to the point, why are you doing this?
What are you talking about?
Did you forget what Penny did to you?
It took you two years and defiling my sister
to turn that frown upside down
I didn't defile your sister, we had a relationship
I heard you call her Brown Sugar
In my book, that's defilement
You want to know my opinion?
Oh, boy, do I!
Sarcasm?
No
All right, then
The reason you're fixated on
a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that
she's the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment:
your brilliant yet intimidating mother
Where on earth did you get that from?
It's in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby 
That doesn't make it true
It's called nonfiction for a reason, Leonard
See you later
If they ever make a movie version
of that book, you know who should play Leonard's mother?
Sandra Bullock
Why?
Because she's great in everything
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes Does anyone have any wood?
(both snickering)
Oh, come on!
I just want wood
Why are you making it so hard?
(both laughing)
So, do they have a name for a first date
with someone you used to go out with?
Oh, that's a good question
How about "awkward"?
Yeah, that sounds right
Yeah?
Hey, how about if we pretend we're actually on a first date?
See how that goes
Okay
(clears throat)
So, Polly, tell me about yourself
(chuckles)
It's Penny
Oh, sorry, yeah Awkward
(laughs)
Okay, uh, let's see
I'm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl,
I dreamed of moving to LA and becoming a movie star
Anyway,
after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables,
I've done a hemorrhoid commercial
and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley
(chuckles)
So, you know, dreams do come true
Your turn
Uh, let's see
(clears throat)
Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech,
most of my research is with high-powered lasers,
and, oh, I've just gotten a big government grant
to see if they can be used to knock out
incoming ballistic missiles
Wow Can they?
Oh, God, no
The money's pretty good
And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal
(laughs)
Bat-signal?
What are you, some kind of nerd?
Not some kind of nerd, I'm the king of the nerds
(laughs)
What does that mean?
Uh, it means if anyone displeases me,
I don't help them set up their printer
(laughs)
You are so funny
Good
Remember that when I take my shirt off
(both laugh)
Leonard, this is nice
I'm so glad we did this
Me, too
So what do you think?
Are we gonna get back together?
Whoa Not so fast
I'm sorry, what did I say?
Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you
Oh, God What?
You said "always"
You'll always have feelings for me
So?
So, that sounds more like
something you'd say if you didn't want
a relationship with someone
"This isn't working out,
but I'll always have feelings for you"
"I'm sorry I slept with your best friend,
but I'll always have feelings for you"
"Here's the thing, Lisa,
I'm into dudes now, but I'll always have feelings for you"
How would you say it?
I have feelings for you
It's the same thing No, it's not
"Always" made it worse
You're overthinking this
No, I'm not Yes, you are
You always overthink things
Th-There you go "Always" made it worse
See, this is where everything goes wrong: when we talk
Well, I don't know how you have a relationship without talking
Hey, I went out with this guy TJ
for eight months, we never talked
To this day, I don't even know what TJ stands for
Wait, if you guys didn't talk, what--
Never mind, stupid question
And now that I have some wood,
I'm going to begin the erection of my settlement
He's got to be doing this on purpose
(laughs)
Ooh, 8:30
You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?
You're 30 years old and you live with your mother
I guess it didn't go well
We don't know that
Not to a certainty
All we know is that Leonard is home
(Leonard screams)
How about now?
Again, not enough evidence
For all we know, he's being murdered
Now, back to our game
You were in the middle of an erection
Oh, of course It's right here in my hand
(cell phone chimes)
(grunting quietly)
What does she want from me now?
What's up?
Do not overthink this
I don't understand Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup
Okay, but earlier it seemed like
No talking
Even during? 'Cause sometimes I have questions
(panting)
Well, that was fun
Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp
You hung in there, though
There was a lot at stake
So what do you want to do now?
Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler,
but it might ruin the moment
(grunts)
Just, just help me out here
How does a miserable date end in sex?
I don't know, it's complicated
Well, I'm a pretty smart guy,
and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply,
so give it a go
Okay, it's just,
at the restaurant when you said
you wanted us to be together again,
it got very real very fast and I panicked
Why?
What are you afraid of?
Well, what if we do go out
and I do something stupid and dump you again?
What if I dump you?
(scoffs)
Come on, be serious
Well, how about if we don't think
about this as a relationship?
It could be more like a new version of software
Penny and Leonard 20
We can test it internally, shake out the bugs,
and if we both feel it's solid,
then we'll roll it out to the public
So we don't tell people we're back together?
Exactly
We pretend like our date went badly
Well, we don't really have to pretend
And we let them think that we decided
to just be friends
and that everything's cool
Okay, great
(grunts softly)
Hey, I just remembered
I still got one of your inhalers
I can't believe you kept this
Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn't
That is so sweet
(sighs)
In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you
how much this means to me
(toilet flushes)
Leonard?
Yeah, hi, hi
How's it going?
Uh, can't complain
Thanks for asking
Well, what were you doing out at 3:00 in the morning?
Well, uh, uh what are you doing up?
I was using the bathroom
Yeah, well, so was I
Really?
I didn't see you in there
Obviously when I saw that you were in ours,
I went and used another one
Where?
The, the gas station across the street
In your pajamas?
Yes
Without shoes?
Yes
On a cold winter's night?
Yes
Seems unlikely
Did you bring your asthma inhaler?
Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did
Well, then, I guess it's plausible
D-- hang on a second, mister
What?
After you used the facilities at the gas station,
did you make a purchase?
What?
It's customary, when using the restroom
at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase
Did you?
No
(scoffs)
Here's two dollars
Go buy some beef jerky
I don't want beef jerky
It's not about you
It's about a poor immigrant from Pakistan
trying to make his way in America
by working the graveyard shift
at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron
Fine
Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed
Leonard will be here in a moment
He's looking for a different parking space
Why?
We were next to a car
with an "Ask me about my grandchildren" bumper sticker,
and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out,
I'd be obligated to do so
I'm so disappointed it didn't work with him and Penny
Me, too
Out of deference to them,
let's not flaunt our happy relationship
You have a keen insight into the human heart,
Amy Farrah Fowler
We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker
Well, I doubt they'd want to talk about that, so we're fine
I'm surprised to see you here
after it went so badly with Penny
Well, hey, we're grown-ups
We can still be friends
Boy, I don't know if I could be friends with Howie
if we broke up
Why not?
I'm a very vengeful person
Really?
With access to weaponized smallpox
Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water
You need menus or you know what you want?
Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks
like he's not gonna get it from you
Howard No,
that's okay, Bernadette
Sometimes these things just don't work out
Yeah, it's all good
We-We'll always have feelings for each other
Oh, that's nice
See, she knew what "always" meant
Wow, you're like a dog with a bone, aren't you?
I'm just making a point
Is the point that you don't know when to let something go?
People, people,
please, before you say
something you both regret,
I'd like to place my order
Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon
You know why we can't be together?
Because you always have to be right
Oh, that is not true
I got to go with Leonard on this
He is wrong more than anyone I know
You know what? I just realized I'm on a break
I'll get someone else
Well
Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over,
you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship
with her, because I am very, very hungry
(grunting quietly)
(phone chimes)
Unbelievable
Mind explaining to me why you were being
such a jerk at the restaurant? Well,
I was trying to act like we weren't seeing each other
That was the plan, right? No,
the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends
That's a little hard to do
when you're always being such a tool bag
You know what? I don't have to stand here and take this crap
The hell do you think you're going?
Isn't sex after fighting kind of what we do now?!
Yeah, kind of, yeah
What are we doing?
What do you mean?
Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly
That's because you overthink everything
SHELDON: Leonard, are you listening to me? 
What? Yeah
This is a disaster
I distinctly ordered
the Leonard Nimoy Mr Spock cardboard standee
Why would I feel safer
with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?
I don't know, he was pretty badass on Heroes 
You're right, I'll give him a shot
Hang on
Penny, do you have plans for dinner?
Why, you guys going somewhere?
No, I mean just you and me
Ooh! Ooh!
Uh, have you thought this through?
Yes, and I think we should go anyway
No, can't do it
Sorry, Quinto, you're going back
If you and Leonard get back together,
Sheldon and I will finally have someone
to go on double dates with
What about me and Howard?
Fine, we can double with you, too
So insecure
Where are you guys going to eat?
Penny?
Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?
Well, it's a little late for me
to start saying no, isn't it?
Penny
Sorry, just remembered
I've got to stop at the drugstore

Hello visit tvshowslatestblogspotcom to download Big Bang Theory
I'm Dr Sheldon Cooper,
and welcome to the premiere episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags
Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore
the dynamic world of vexillology
Hang on, Dr C
What's vexillology?
Vexillology is the study of flags
Cool
I think I just learned something
Did you have fun doing it?
I'll say
Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast,
not unlike the only two-sided state flag--
Oregon
Oh, look
Hello, Mr Beaver
In future episodes, we'll answer some burning questions:
What's the only non-rectangular flag?
What animal appears most often on flags?
What animal appears second most often on flags?
And more
Sweet!
Why are you waving a white flag?
I'm surrendering
to fun
(laughs)
Now, today's episode of Fun with Flags is not fun,
but it is important
"Flags: you gotta know how to hold 'em,
you gotta know how to fold 'em"
Let's start by identifying the parts of our flag
This edge is the hoist, and it's used to
Excuse me, sorry, excuse me
Cut
Did you not see we are rolling?
Sorry I'm having dinner with Penny
I have to get out of here
And I have flag knowledge
that I have to get out of here!
(sighs)
You okay?
No, I'm a little rattled
But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I'm still here
And take two
Hello
I'm Dr Sheldon Cooper,
and welcome to the premiere episode
of Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags
Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore
the dynamic world of vexillology
Hang on, Dr Cooper
What's vexillology?
Vexillology is
why is there a face on that flag?
It's Ferdinand T Flag
I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers
Confound it!
You're right, it's brilliant Let's take it from the top
(Klaxon blaring) (screams)
What the hell?
Emergency preparedness drill
- Oh, no, come on! - Yeah, you know how it works
Once a quarter, keep our readiness up
Now, rise and shine, sleepy head
Half the town is probably dead
I have to get a lock for my door
I think you'll like the drill tonight
I've tried to make it fun
Each of these cards
contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event
Everything from wild fires
to a surprise invasion by Canada
Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe
Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California
Yeah, really? You think those hippies
in Washington and Oregon can stop them?
Fine
All righty!
"An 82 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena,
"reducing mighty edifices to dust,
"engulfing the city in flames
"The streets flow with blood
and echo with the cries of the wounded"
Oh, excellent choice
Now, put on your hardhat and safety vest
Oh, fun
I get to spend another night in front of our apartment
dressed like one of the Village People
You make that joke every three months
I still don't get it
Leonard wait
What are you doing?
I don't know, what am I doing?
Look around you--
there's hypothetical broken glass everywhere
Really? You're going to face Armageddon
without your orthotics?
Your choice
Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!
(yells) (thud)
Aah!
And that's why we wear hardhats
Gentlemen, I think I've come up with a
fun way to get young people interested in science
Physics Mad-Libs
- Now, give me a number - Five
Uh-huh
And an irrational constant
"E"
And a funny Greek letter
Gamma
I said funny
Upsilon?
Good one
And an electrical charge
Positive
(laughs) Perfect
SHELDON: Okay Get this
(clears throat)
"Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method
"for calculating the mass of a muon
Five times the limit of (laughs) 'E' to the upsilon as"
(laughing)
(clearing throat): Okay No, no
I'll start over
"Professor"
(cracking up)
I haven't seen him laugh that hard
since the day Leonard made that multiplication error
Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error!
(laughing): He thought he carried the one
But he didn't
(laughing)
It's not funny
That mistake got published
Stop! I'm going to wet myself!
Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way
I wonder what he wants
Doesn't look happy, so I'm guessing
he wants to talk to Sheldon
Dr Cooper?
Told ya
Oh, President Siebert,
I assume you'd like to respond to one of the suggestions
I put in the box by your office
No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere
You don't like written suggestions
You don't like when I give them to you while we're urinating
in the men's room
If I didn't know you any better, I'd say that you're one of those
stubborn people who are not open to suggestions
Dr Cooper, the physics department chair tells me
you're refusing to take your vacation
I don't need a vacation
You're obligated to take one
And I'd also like you to know the most-often received
suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me
is "Can Dr Cooper take a vacation?"
Okay, settled, then
I'll see y'all of you Monday, except for you
But if I don't come into work,
what am I supposed to do with myself?
Read, rest, travel
I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year
Sarcasm?
No You should go
It was a nice retirement party visit tvshowslatestblogspotcom to download
I guess
Still, it's a shame
Professor Rothman was forced to step down
What choice did the university have?
He snapped
It happens to theoretical physicists all the time
I wonder how long Sheldon's got
These shrimp are all the same size
There's no the logical order to eat them in
Can't be very long
Hey, look, there's Rothman's empty office
- Sad - Mm, indeed
Yeah
So sad
Dibs
(tape measure retracting)
What's up, fellas?
What are you doing here, Kripke?
Ah, measuring my new office for drapes
This is not your office
It hasn't been assigned yet
Well, I called dibs at the Christmas party
when Professor Rothman tried to have intercourse
with the Toys for Tots collection box
Dibs?!
This is a university, not a playground
Offices are not assigned
because someone called dibs
You just called dibs
Shut it
Offices are assigned by seniority
I arrived at the university first
I arrived at the office first
I'm the proverbial early bird
Gentlemen
ALL: Professor Rothman
Good evening
(others muttering "Good evening" )
I'm glad that men are wearing hats again
They're so distinguished
I'm just gonna run to the store and get a few things
I'll pick you up when you're done
Okay
I like it a little better when you stay, but all right
Hey, Sheldon
Hello I'm here for my haircut
with Mr D'Onofrio
I'm sorry, Uncle Tony's in the hospital
He's pretty sick
Oh, dear, Mr D'Onofrio's in the hospital
Why do these things always happen to me?
I can cut it for you
You're not Mr D'Onofrio
I get my hair cut by Mr D'Onofrio
You believe this guy?
(murmurs)
Excuse us for a second
Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it
He's a barber
He's not a barber, he's the nephew
He's an example of the kind
of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry
Besides, Mr D'Onofrio knows
exactly how I like my hair done because he has
all my haircut records from my barber in Texas
What are you talking about?
When I first moved here,
I was nervous about finding a new barber,
so my mother had all my haircut records
sent here to Mr D'Onofrio
There's no such thing as haircut records
Yes, there are
Have you ever seen them?
No, but my mother assured me they were sent here,
and I'll bet you dollars to donuts
that this one doesn't have them
Uh, excuse me
Do you have access to my haircut records?
Your what?
To paraphrase TS Eliot,
this is the way the world ends--
not with a bang but with a nephew
Sheldon, you're a grown man, he's a professional,
and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946
Just sit down
and let him do it
Fine, but if I come out of this
looking like a dork, it's on you
(clears throat)
So my kid said the funniest thing today
Nope
When you tell this story later,
the word we usually use is "quirky"
Hey, want to spend some time playing the new
Star Wars game this weekend?
Oh, I don't know I kind of promised myself
I'd get off the computer, be more physically active
Get some exercise
You're about to walk up three flights of stairs
Good point, I'm in
KOOTHRAPPALI: You know what would be great?
Let's do it like the old days
You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?
Yeah Start Saturday morning,
go 48 hours,
sleeping bags, junk food
Turn off our phones so our moms can't call
It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago
when the neighbors called the cops on us
(both chuckle)
They called the cops because of the smell
They thought we were dead
We were badass back in the day
All right, let's do it
48 hours of Star Wars gaming
It's on like Alderaan
(all laugh)
Hey, Sheldon,
clear your weekend Starting Saturday morning,
Star Wars marathon Whoohoo!
Movies or video games?
No, board game?
Or trading card games?
Or Lego's? Or dress up?
Or comic books?!
Or dramatic readings of novelizations?!
Yes to all!
We are going to play the online game
The online game?!
Bully!
Gentlemen, as much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy
playing intergalactic make-believe,
he and I have other plans
We are attending my Aunt Flora's 93rd birthday party
Just tell her I can't come
She'll be disappointed if we don't show up
She's 93
She won't be disappointed for very long
No, hang on I followed all the protocols
set forth by you in the relationship agreement
I made a written record request 72 hours in advance
I checked the tire pressure on the car
I even contacted the Centers For Disease Control to find out
what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County
FYI, it's none
Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed
for either one of us to get our way
You use it to get your way
I use it to get the right way
The fact that the right way is
also my way is a happy coincidence
You gave me your word
You're coming with me
We'll miss you, Sheldon
Yeah, well,
who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around
a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters
That's for babies
Yeah, but it's got lightsabers
Yeah, please, Amy! It's got lightsabers!
Oh, my God I love this chicken
Oh, you know what they say,
best things in life are free
Okay, you're right I eat your food a lot
Now, how about this?
You can raid my fridge anytime you want
Oh, that's very kind of you
Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D-cell battery
with a jar of old pickle juice,
(clicks tongue) I'll come a-knockin'
Hey, Raj, you didn't send your RSVP in
I'm suppose to ask you if you're bringing someone to the wedding
I'll let you know
Well, can you make it soon?
There's a battle royale going on over the seating charts
In one corner, Bernadette's mom, in the other three, mine
Yeah, I hate wedding receptions
Yeah, I wish the bride and groom
would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins
Slip on the ring, disappear, and everyone goes home
Mm, you liked Professor Geyser's wedding
They had a make-your-own-sundae bar
Oh, that was a night to remember
Do you know, on one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts
Anyway, you got to let me know if you have a plus one
Because if not, my mom's trying to sneak in the doctor
who sucked the fat out of her neck
All right, uh, fine
I'm coming and I'm bringing somebody
Uh, Koothrappali plus one
Who you bringing?
Who are you bringing?!
He's bringing me; who are you bringing?
Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O'Donnells
Come on, who is it?
I'm not telling
I'm from Asia, I'm mysterious, deal with it
Howard aren't having a make-your-own-sundae bar?
I don't think so
Well, you should
50% of marriages end in divorce,
but 100% of make-your-own-sundae bars end in happiness
So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning
I don't mean to burst your bubble, dude,
but those penile enlargement pills do not work
Believe me, I know
The e-mail I got was
from the office of Stephen Hawking
- You're kidding - Why?
He's coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture,
and he's looking for an engineer to help maintain
the equipment on his wheelchair
That's amazing
You'll be like his pit crew
A word of caution: I would not do
your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him
(in Stephen Hawking's voice): You're right
I suppose that could be considered offensive
Boy, Sheldon's going to freak out
Yeah, he worships Hawking
I was actually thinking about bringing him along
when I go over there so he can meet the great man
That's really nice of you, Howard
It's no big deal
Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking
It'll look so nice next to the ones he's already got
from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee
Leonard, do you recall
when I said that I was going
to revolutionize humanity's understanding
of the Higgs boson particle, and you said,
"Sheldon, it's 2:00 am, get out of my bedroom"?
Like it was ten hours ago
What about it?
Well, I believe I've done it
And I'm only saying "believe" to sound modest,
because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it
Really? That's incredible Oh, here
Break out the math
Oh, okay, let me see this
All right, so this particle here
is the boson moving forward in time
Now, I was thinking Howard, you go ahead and eat
This isn't going to make any sense to you
Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics
Yeah, good for you, and don't stop working on it
Are you still going to tell him
about you-know-who? Yep
Are you still going to introduce him?
Not on your life
(laughs)
I wish you could all be inside my head
The conversation is sparkling
Fine, I'll tell you
A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species,
fungi and algae
If you could merge with another species,
what species would you pick and why?
Hint: There is a right answer
None of you will get it
Okay, I'd pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid
would have the advanced industrial civilization
of a human and the long graceful neck
I've always dreamed of having
Wrong Leonard?
Horse, but mostly just for the height
A little bit for the genital girth
Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we?
Kangaroo, uh,
I'd be Kanga-Jew
(chuckles)
The first of my people to dunk a basketball (chuckles)
Also instead of just living in your mother's house,
you could actually live inside her body
(mocking laugh)
Clever, but also wrong
No, the best organism for human beings to merge with
is the lichen itself
That way, you'd be human, fungus, and algae
Triple threat
Like three-bean salad
Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful
All right, picture this:
a beautiful outdoor concert
Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven
As a fungus, I have a terrific view,
growing out of a towering maple tree
And no thank you, expensive concessions
Because as an algae, I'll just snack on this sunlight
- He got us again - No, he didn't
Anyway, if it's okay with you,
we should talk about Howard's bachelor party
Oh, oh
Seems like a bit of a letdown
after our lichen conversation, but
What do you know, you're half swan
I've been doing some research on strippers
One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price
if we're flexible on age range and number of limbs
Sounds like loads of fun,
but I promised Bernadette no strippers
You don't want strippers? You're the king of strippers
The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you
What can I tell ya-- I'm not into that stuff anymore
Good for you, Howard I'm proud of you
And still, you're the first one of use to get married
We have to do something special
You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom--
Well, it's probably not for me
Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley
They've got that wine train
Boo, wine!
But yay, trains I'm in
Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year
Uh, you travel through the vineyards
There's a tasting on board
And all the wildflowers are in bloom
Magic
Look at that, in 30 seconds,
we went from hiring women to being them
Howard Wolowitz
Hey, Howard Dave Roeger here at NASA
We need to talk about your upcoming mission
Yes, yes, I've been doing my push-ups
I'm still stuck at nine, but
that's going all the way down with no one holding me
That's great, uh, but that's not why I called
We've run into a bit of a snafu
Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test,
so bottom line, mission's been scrubbed
You're kidding So what does that mean?
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Boy, I got to tell you,
I'm really disappointed
This was my dream
ever since I was a little kid
Okay, well, uh,
thanks for the call
Yep, you, too
Yes! Thank you!
Oh! Oh
I'm not gonna die in space!
I'm gonna die the way God intended,
in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami
? Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state ?
? Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait! ?
? The Earth began to cool ?
? The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools ?
? We built the Wall ? ? We built the pyramids ?
? Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery ?

I'm going to need a larger shirt
This one's a little tight under the arms
Okay
Do you think maybe it's tight
because you're wearing long underwear?
Yes, of course that's why it's tight
All right, let me rephrase the question
Why are you wearing long underwear?
You're kidding
Shouldn't the question be: why aren't you?
No, it should be: why are you? (sighs) Leonard,
these rental tuxedos have been
worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers
I don't like my own sweat touching my skin,
how do you think I feel about theirs?
Why don't you slip this on?
Said the hangman offering a noose
Well, that wasn't as entertaining
as when he rents bowling shoes,
but it was right up there
Well, that's it
My orders have been rescinded
I am officially "no go" to space
I'm sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you,
I'm a little relieved you're not going
Why?
Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket
designed in the 1960s by the Russians
Yeah, so?
When was the last time you were at Best Buy
and you heard someone say, "Ooh, check out this Blu-ray player,
it must be good, it was built in Russia"?
Well, their technology isn't that bad
When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall
from space at 500 miles per hour,
and the only thing that slows you down
is a little parachute that pops out
right before you crash into the ground
And the whole thing was designed
by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture
Rocky and Bullwinkle
All right, well, whatever
I wasn't worried
You weren't?
Let me explain the difference between you and me
You watch
Star Trek; I live it
Oh, please I don't remember the episode of Star Trek 
where the guy never goes to space
and brags about it in a tuxedo store
Make all the jokes you want,
but there's only one of us here brave enough
to almost do what I almost did
Ah, much better
You must be burning up
A little But not more than your urethras
will be after whatever's in those pants swims up them
Well
I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don't I?
I look like the Flash about to get married
Oh! A tissue! A tissue!
Oh, good Lord!
Uh, where's he going?
He keeps emergency Purell in the car
Keys! Keys! Keys!
Hey, you Before I come in,
you should know, I have gas
For the record, not your worst opening line
Check it out It's the gas I use
in my free-electron laser to support high voltages
But it also has an interesting secondary use
Here Breathe this in
B-Before I do it, if you're a cop you have tell me, right?
Just try it
Okay
What's it supposed to
Oh, my God, that's so freaky!
? You're a mean one ?
? Mr Grinch ?
Okay Me, me, me Ready?
Leonard, I am your father
I have never been more attracted to a woman
who sounds like a man in my life
Oh
Mm
Hey you know how we've been
taking things slow? Mm-hmm
Well, I've been thinking, and
maybe I'm ready to
take things a little faster
Oh
great Mm-hmm
And I promise, after waiting four months,
fast is what you're gonna get
You know, just-just one thing
Look, we're in a really great place right now,
and I don't want to do anything
that will make stuff all weird again
So we won't let it get weird
Okay Oh, and just a heads-up
mm, since the last time you saw me naked,
I got a Cookie Monster tattoo
The acceptable responses when you see it
are "awesome" or nothing
What about
Cookies!
Amy?
Amy?
Amy?
7:00, right on time
It's not an accident
I waited outside your door for 20 minutes
Well, dinner's almost ready
I must say,
I was surprised you chose to spend
our date night in your apartment
As I mentioned,
the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times,
and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale
You ask anyone,
that's a hot date
Tempting choices, but I have something special
planned for tonight
What can be more special than having
an adequate amount of time to cross the street
on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
With our friends moving forward in their relationships,
I've decided that we should make progress in ours as well
Oh, dear Lord
Two years ago, we didn't even know each other,
and now I'm in your apartment after dark
How much faster can this thing go?
I had a feeling you'd be reluctant,
which is why I'm going to dip
into my neurobiological bag of tricks
Oh, you brain monkeys kill me Dip away
I have devised
an experiment that I believe will increase
your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame
And how do you propose to do that?
Uh, hope you're not thinking
about some sort of LSD thought control
Because there's
only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys,
and that's called school
Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up
In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera
I'm going to attempt
an experiment that will get you to transfer
those feelings to me
Well,
seems what's on the menu tonight
is malarkey with a big side of poppycock
We'll see
Let's start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?
Super Mario Bros theme?
Yes
I see what you're doing
You're attempting to build on the work
of Ebbinghaus by triggering
an involuntary memory of me playing that game--
admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood
but it won't work
Fine There's no reason we still can't have
a lovely dinner Why don't you have a seat
Boink! Boink!
May I offer you something to drink?
You know I don't drink
Not even
strawberry Quik?
I love strawberry Quik
It's my favorite pink fluid,
narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol
Oh, I know
I think it will go nicely
with what I have prepared
for dinner
Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
Just like your mommy used to make
Oh
yummy, yummy!
We should do this more often
Uh-oh
I'm sorry I did,
I crossed a line I didn't mean to!
Who says something like that right in the middle
of sex?! I don't know,
it just came out People say weird things
during sex all the time
Okay, well, they sure as hell don't say that
It was the heat of the moment No,
the heat of the moment is, "Ooh, yeah, just like that,"
not "will you marry me?"
I'm sorry
Just-just give me another chance
Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go,
"Hey, baby, want to go look for houses
in neighborhoods with good schools?"
Again, I'm sorry
You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married,
I got caught up in a little wedding fever
I take it back You can't
take something like that back
I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?
Okay, at some point, we'll look back
and this is going to be a funny story
Why don't we just start doing that now?
You're kidding No
Hey, do you remember
that time when I proposed
to you in bed?
And you were all, like, "What are you doing?"
That was so funny
So funny
It's not funny
Give it a minute
Is that a little smile I see there?
I should go
Hey, I was thinking
For our first dance at the wedding,
what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing? 
You're kidding No,
come on
How cool would that be?
Me running into your arms
you lifting me up into the air
Oh, you're in a good mood
Yeah, well, why wouldn't I be?
You know, I'm marrying the girl of my dreams,
and I finally got my mother to agree
not to come on our honeymoon
Oh, hang on
Oh, it's NASA
Wolowitz
Oh! Hi, Dave What's up?
No kidding Really?
Well,
that's great news
Great, great news
All right, I'll watch my e-mail
for the details
Okay, talk soon
What's so great?
It looks like I'm going into space after all
Oh, Howie, that's wonderful!
Uh-huh, wonderful
Yay
What happened? I thought
they canceled your mission Th-They did
But NASA really wants
my telescope up on the space station,
so they're putting me on an earlier launch
When? A
week from Friday
What? We're getting married that Sunday
You're right!
I-I can't go to space
I have to get married, and no one can say
that's not a good reason I'll call him back
Wait I don't want to be
the one who stands in your way
Well, too bad, you already did It's a done deal
Oh, well But I forgive you
No That's not how I want to start our marriage,
killing your dream?
We'll have the wedding when you get back
But wh-what about
all the plans and the guests?
We'll call them
Although my dad's gonna go a little nutso
over losing his deposits
You're right, he is!
Your dad's gonna be furious
There's no way he's gonna let us postpone this wedding
Well, we tried
I'll talk to him
He won't say no to his little girl No!
I-I should talk to him,
man to man
But, Howie, my dad can be a bully
He's gonna make you cancel your space flight
We can only hope
that he doesn't
Bishop to queen four,
level two
Check
Sheldon
knight takes bishop
You all right?
I'm fine
Are you?
You left your queen exposed from above,
you trapped your knight in the corner,
and you keep sighing and saying, "Why me?"
Very well
Can I ask you a question about women?
We got you that book last year
Wasn't everything in there?
No, I'm having a relationship problem with Amy
And by the way,
that book gave me nightmares
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I screwed things up pretty good with Penny
Look at us, Leonard
engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching
about their ol' ladies
I guess we are
So, what's going on?
Believe it or not,
Amy has embarked on a campaign
to increase my feelings for her by making me happy
I'm sorry, that must be very difficult for you
It's awful
This morning, she arranged for me
to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day
It-It's usually
only open to children
She got them to make an exception
Shame on her
They let me blow the whistle, Leonard
She's good
I know
And it gets worse
Her efforts are causing me
to have affectionate feelings for her
at inappropriate times
You mean, like in bed or in the shower?
No!
Would you please stop referencing that infernal book?
For example, this morning,
I was calculating the random motion
of virtual particles in a vacuum,
when suddenly the particles morphed
into an image of Amy's dandruff
gently cascading down
onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders
What has that vixen done to me, Leonard?
And how do I make it stop?
Well, if you had a physical relationship,
I'd say propose during sex
Turns out that's a real mood killer
I assume we're talking about you now?
Yeah
So, that's how this works?
I complain, and then you complain,
and no one offers any solutions?
Pretty much
Well, no wonder the women are winning
Mr Rostenkowski, are you busy?
Oh, just looking at some old pictures Come on in
Family pictures, or?
H-Holy crap, that's a dead person
Last murder case before I retired
How many bodies do you see there?
Careful,
it's a trick question
I'm not sure
Nah, you'll never get it
It's a fraction
How about that
Anyway,
sir, I need to talk to you about something
Walnut?
No, thank you
I'm allergic
Oh, sure
My partner used to have that
He's dead now
From nuts?
Nah, his wife shot him
But she was nuts, so in a way
Nice story
Anyway,
the reason I wanted to talk to you is
NASA has moved up my launch
to the International Space Station
Yeah, so? So
the date is going to conflict
with me marrying your daughter
Now, I know what you're going to say-- I made
a commitment to Bernadette and to your family
and I've got a hell of a lot of nerve
coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing
Well, message heard and understood
Mission canceled Thank you
Where are you going?
I'm sorry
May I be excused?
No, you may not
Let me tell you something
When I first met you
You just gonna stand there?
I'm sorry, I didn't know, is this going to
Well, I should sit
May I be seat Well, I'll just sit
When I first met you,
I didn't like you
I'm aware of that, sir
But then you and I had some time together
Uh-huh
It did not get better
Right, right
That silly Beatle haircut
and
you riding around on a red Vespa,
and you're still living at home with your mother
To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you
to punish me
But then I heard about your astronaut thing,
and I realized
I judged you too fast
Maybe you are
the right guy for my little girl
Oh, I am And just so you know,
I'd still be an astronaut, even if I didn't go to space
I've got an ID card and a NASA golf shirt
No, no, you got to go
You can't turn down an opportunity like this
B-But what about the wedding
and all the money you put down for the reception?
You let me worry about that
You go up to that space station,
and you make me proud
Um, okay
You got a problem with that?
All right, look, I'm gonna level with you
I'm terrified about going into space
What if I don't make it back?
It's gonna be okay, son
You really think so?
Of course
A pretty girl like Bernadette
she'll find a new guy
Hey
Hey
Off to work?
Yeah
Have a nice night
Okay, you, too
Penny, just, wait
I've been thinking about what I said
when we were in bed the other night
Yeah, I've been thinking about it, too
I noticed you never answered me
You're right
No
Uh, follow-up Are we still dating?
Yep
Is it still weird 'cause I proposed?
Yep
I have a couple more quick questions
Do you want to call me from the car?
No!
Think I played that pretty well
Hello, Leonard
What are you doing?
We're playing doctor
Star Trek style
I'm in hell, Leonard
Don't stop

Previously on The Big Bang Theory:
Who says something like that
right in the middle of sex?! I don't know
It was the heat of the moment!
No, the heat of the moment is "Ooh, yeah, just like that"
Not, "Will you marry me?"
NASA really wants my telescope

so they're putting me on an earlier launch

A week from Friday

You're right
I can't go to space
I have to get married

Your dad's going to be furious
There's no way he's going to let us

I'll talk to him
He won't say no to his little girl
No! I, uh, I should talk to him

It's going to be okay, son
You really think so?
Of course
A pretty girl like Bernadette,
she'll find a new guy
Hey, Mike?
Yeah
I changed my mind I don't want to do this
Good one
Yeah, I'm a funny guy
I also have a hysterical bit planned for later
where I pretend to cry through the whole launch
Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?
289, right between the Game Show Network at 288
and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290
I love his eidetic memory, it's so sexy
Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?
Dried potatoes, vegetable oil,
corn flour, wheat starch,
maltodextrin, salt,
and my favorite ingredient of all, uniformity
The uterus quivers, does it not?
There's Howard's rocket, live from Kazakhstan
Oh, God, I'm so nervous
I don't think I can watch
You're nervous? I've been stress-eating for four days
Look at me
I'm wearing my fat pants
Remarkable In just under a half hour,
200 metric tons of fuel will
ignite in a controlled explosion
right beneath Howard's keister
And all from a country whose entire contribution
to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides
Give me those damn Pringles
Da 
Okay, we're in the final countdown
How you doing over there?
Good! Good!
Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing
How much urine do these suits hold?
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
We now pronounce you husband and wife!
I love this part!
Me, too!
I have strongly mixed feelings!
So, Howard's really in space, huh?
Mm-hmm, International Space Station
250 miles that way
Right now, Howard's staring down at our planet
like a tiny Jewish Greek god
Zeusowitz
I must admit,
I can't help but feel a twinge of envy
He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe
unfolding before his eyes
His dim, uncomprehending eyes
It's like a cat in an airport carrying case
You know, it's not exactly glamorous up there
The water that the astronauts drink
is made from each other's recycled urine
Must be nice
Nobody wants anything that comes out of me 
I wonder what he's doing right this very second
Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity
Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos
Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same
Howard! Can you hear me?! 
I can hear you without the phone!
Don't be snippy
I'm just excited to talk to my baby!
I'm excited to talk to you, too
So, what's this mishegas about you moving out
to go live with the little Polish girl?!
How about calling her my wife?
Wives don't take boys from their mothers
They do That's why we marry them!
I just hope I'm not dead from a broken heart
before you get back
Ma, please Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call
Good They should know what a horrible son you are!
Okay, Ma, great talking to you! Gotta go!
Well space is ruined
 Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state
Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool
The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools
We built the Wall We built the pyramids 
Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery
That all started with a big bang
Bang!

This is so exciting
Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde
as my beautiful best friend
Hey, this is my natural hair color
Now
So, does Sheldon have anything special
planned for you tomorrow night?
Oh, yes According to the Relationship Agreement,
on the anniversary of our first date,
he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day
and engage in casual physical contact
that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy
That's hot
You kids better use protection
How long does this stay on?
Just a couple of minutes
You've really never done this before?
Once in high school, but I dozed off
and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face
Oh, my gosh, that's awful
The other kids make fun of you?
No, I had a cover story; I told everyone it was herpes
So, how's everything going with you and Leonard?
I don't know, it's still kind of weird
We haven't really recovered since he proposed to me
in the middle of sex
Oh Boo-hoo
If Sheldon proposed to me during sex,
my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go
Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
Interesting question On the one hand, I always thought
You don't even know what it is, do you?
The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain
why our universe exists the way it does,
the answer is that it must have qualities
that allow intelligent creatures to arise
who are capable of asking the question
As I am doing so eloquently right now
I know what the anthropic principle is
Of course I just explained it to you
Now, where do you stand on it?
Where do you stand on it? Strongly pro
Then I believe that God created the world in six days,
and on the seventh, he made you to annoy me
Hey, guys Hey
Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?
I'm all for it Attaboy!
Well, hang on Why do you believe
that he knows what it is and I don't?
Oh, Leonard Let's not take a saw
to the branch we're sitting on, shall we?
Hey, uh, if you guys
are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet
in a pool full of little fish
that eat all the dead skin right off them
I don't need to tell you,
in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round
Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny
Oh, okay Sounds like it's me and you, Sheldon
How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?
As I've stated before on numerous occasions,
the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by
is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are:
"Release the Kraken"
That never gets old
"Release the Kraken!" Oh, chills
Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy
Oh, okay I'll just go home and be alone
W-Which is cool
I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so
Cool
Darn If you weren't busy, I'd ask you to join us
Really? I can come? Thanks!
Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj
on your date night with Amy?
Oh, absolutely
I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation
and casual physical contact,
but nowhere is it specified
that I can't outsource that to an Indian
Howie?
Howie?
Hey, there's my beautiful bride!
Can you see me?
I can How are you?
I'm amazing
I mean, this is even better than I dreamed
I look out the window, and it's all so unbelievable
Good for you
I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom
Oh, yeah? That's nice
It was Until I found out you never told her
we're not gonna live with her
Let's talk about that for a minute
Hey, look, this pen is floating
How crazy is that?
You said you told her, but you never did!
Okay, okay, I know you're upset, but
let me share something I've learned since I got here
You realize
how small your problems are
when you're looking down on them from space
Now, come on, that's got to make you feel better
How clear is the image of me on that screen?
Pretty clear
Do I look like I feel better?
I mean, it's not, like, HD quality
Listen, mister, you're gonna talk to your mother
and you're gonna fix this, or that thing I said
I was gonna do to you the minute you got home,
you can do to yourself
Like he's been doing since he got here
Sheldon, this place is so romantic
Oh, I'm glad you like it
Raj picked it out
Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you
Tell him yourself
Yoo-hoo!
Over here!
I don't understand What's he doing here?
I invited him
On our date?
Sheldon, that's not okay
Yes, it is
There's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement
You found a loophole?
Sorry I started without you I'm a little nervous
It's been a long time since I've been on a date
I can't believe I bleached my mustache for this
You should go to my girl
She'll knock out those sideburns for free
You know, Amy, I don't even think
you and I have had a real conversation
Let's use tonight to get to know each other a little better
You start
Go home
I don't understand
Sheldon, how could you do this? It's our second anniversary
It's your anniversary?!
Oh, my God, I had no idea
Amy, please, let me make this right
Thank you
My pleasure Waiter?
A bottle of champagne and three glasses
Oh, boy,
isn't this romantic?
Oh, I hope that's a rhetorical question,
because I have no clue
This is great What's the occasion?
No occasion You know, things have been
a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together
a fun night just for you
That is so sweet I got all your favorites
Beer, wings, sliders
We can watch the football game
I even painted my stomach
"Go sports"? Well
in case you were in the mood for baseball,
I didn't want to look ridiculous
This is awesome I love it!
Good, I'm glad
Gosh, I worked my ass off today
This is exactly what I needed
Great Just relax and enjoy
Tonight is all about you
Ah, thank you!
So, where exactly are we in this relationship?
Oh, come on!
I just told you I had a hard day
You're right, I'm sorry Let's watch the game
Great
I just know the longer we wait to talk about it,
the weirder it gets
Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?
Absolutely You're the girl, I'm the guy
Now, you watch your football game
while I make you a little plate here
Thank you!
Oh, I'll get it
Go sports!
Hello-lo-lo
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out th Sheldon and Amy
I was, but it's their anniversary
and I didn't want to be a third wheel,
so I figured I'd come over here
and hang out with you and Penny on your date
Well, it's not really a great time
Penny and I have some things we need to talk about
No, we don't! Come on in!
Sweet!
I can't believe I shaved my stomach for this
Hey, Froot Loops
You got a phone call
Who is it?
A woman who says she's your mother
but sounds like your father
Hey, Ma
You know, we could see each other
if you turn on the computer
I'm not going near that fakakta thing
I'll catch a computer virus!
You can't catch a computer virus
Oh, so now you're an astronaut and a doctor?
What do you want, Ma?
Your wife says you have something important to tell me
Okay, here it is
Bernadette and I are starting a life together and
Oh, God! You are gonna leave me!
Ma
It's okay
Your father left me, you left me--
I guess I'm just the kind of person people like to leave
It's not definite
I'll talk to Bernadette
Don't bother
I'll just go sit in a hole in the ground
so I'm no trouble when I die
Stop it, Ma
I'm sure I can get Bernie to come around
I knew it!
I knew she was behind this!
You listen to me, if you want to be a man,
you can't let a woman tell you what to do!
Okay,
okay
I can't believe these people won the Cold War
Now, can we please change the subject?
Fine
Explain why you've been gone so long 
and I haven't gotten a single letter 
Not even a lousy postcard! 
You know, I'm growing to like American football
Yeah, it's fun, isn't it? Well
it's not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket,
but hey
what is?
All right, who's ready for another beer?
I'm good No, thank you
Girls
I am having the nicest time
You guys are like family to me
You know that, right?
That's great Get out
What? Why?
Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about
Oh
pish on your issues!
You guys are fine
Yes, you hit some bumps along the way
I mean, Penny,
you've always known how this man has felt about you,
but you made him grovel for affection
Okay, hold on
Now, don't blame yourself
He was a groveler from way back
But the point is, the two of you got past it
And, Leonard, you go and propose
to this poor girl in the middle of sex?
That was some weak tea, dude
Some people might say it was romantic
Yeah, no
But yet, here you two are, still together
And that's even after you and I had our crazy naked night
Okay That's enough
I'm just saying
that after everything you've been through,
you get to look into each other's eyes
and say "I love you"
And that's beautiful
Actually, to this day, she's never really said it
Oh, Penny! That's ridiculous!
You know you love him!
You look him in the eyes and you say it
Raj Oh, come on,
you know you want to say it Say it
Say you love him
Say it!
I really thought she would say it
Have I ever told you you're like a sexy praying mantis?
Every time you drink alcohol
You know what's wonderful about the praying mantis?
They devour their mate
Your point being?
Dessert is served
I just had cobbler
You know what?
I'm done with this
W-Where are you going?
I'm leaving
You can't leave
I need you
You do?
Yes
You're my ride
Sheldon, you either say something meaningful
and from the heart, or you and I are done
All right
Please
Amy
when I look in your eyes
and you're looking back in mine,
everything feels not quite normal,
because I feel
stronger and weaker at the same time
I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified
The truth is,
I don't know what I feel, except
I know what kind of man I want to be
Sheldon
that was beautiful
I should hope so
That's from the first Spider-Man movie
I'll take it
Good
Now, I assume we're splitting the check?
Hey, Stuart
Oh, hey I was actually just about to close up
Oh, I'm sorry I'll leave
No, no It's okay Hang out
You sure?
Yeah, you're my first customer today
All right Great
I'm, uh, having a nightcap
You want to join me?
What are you drinking?
Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug
I call it a sad-tini
Perfect for the night I'm having Thank you
Hmm Nice not to drink alone
Amen to that
Sometimes I pour
a little chardonnay into my dog's water bowl
You're kidding
She's kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?
Cheers
Cheers
A little music? Sure
Mmm Bossa nova
You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears
Mmm
Oh
Something about
Latin music just makes me feel like
I'm on a white sand beach in Rio
Yeah
The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies,
tanned and glistening with sweat
I should go Yeah
Uh, thank you for the drink
No problem
Hey, Stuart Yeah?
Do you want to hang out tomorrow night,
maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?
Yeah, I-I'd like to, but I'm a little tight on funds
No problem My treat
I'll swing by after work
Okay
Okay
I could do worse
Aw, that's such good news, Howie 
Thank you for telling her 
Hey, I'm a grown man; I'm gonna live with my wife
My mother's just gonna have to learn to make do on her own
Was she upset?
Who can tell? She yells everything
She might have been upset
She might have been hungry
Thanks for fixing it
I love you
I love you, too
Sweet dreams I'll talk to you tomorrow?
Good night, Rocket Man
To infinity and beyond, baby
Loops
You realize you just lied your ass off
to your wife and your mother
I know
What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?
Oh, I'm never going back

And the next wedding gift is
a gravy boat
Ooh, one gravy boat
That's from Sheldon
He told me he had it engraved
"In the event of a divorce,
please return to Sheldon Cooper"
One "inappropriate,
yet I wish I thought of that" gravy boat
When I get married I'm going to register
at the UCLA Cadaver Lab
Ew, why?
'Cause I've always wanted a whole human skeleton
and they are really spendy
So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?
Not just someday
In exactly four years
But don't tell Sheldon
He's still a flight risk
What about you, Penny?
What about me what?
Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?
Oh, well, you know,
Leonard is great
But do you think you'll ever get married?
He's a sweetie
You're not answering the question
Do you love him?
Yeah, sure, of course I love him
It doesn't sound like it
Well, I do
Do you tell him that?
No, he'd just take it the wrong way
What does that mean?
It means he is special and smart and nice and
Are you gonna break up with him?
No!
Maybe I don't know
I had no idea you were unhappy
That's the thing: I'm not
I'm not unhappy at all It's just I don't know
I-I've been in love before, but it felt different
But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love
Do you ever feel that way about Howard?
Oh, that's not really a fair comparison
I'm basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear
Amy, you?
Can't help ya, kid
Whenever I'm around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire
In the good way
Not the urinary tract infection way
WOLOWITZ: Hey, Bernie 
Hey, how's my little astronautie hottie?
Okay, I guess
It's just, being cooped up in this
tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me
Well, hang in there You just have a couple more
days to go, and then you'll be home
I know
I got to get back to work
I love you
Love you too
Hey, Bernie?
Before you go, can you do something for me?
What do you want me to do?
Okay, here it is
I really miss gravity
Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?
Really, you're serious?
Okay
Oh, baby, you're killing me
Ugh
Hey, Sheldon?
Hi This came for you today
It's from your mom
Oh!
Thank you, Penny Mm-hmm
Yeah, w here
For your troubles
Oh, boy, a whole dollar
Now, I can quit my paper route
So, what's in it?
Mmm, doesn't matter
Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box
Yeah, it's journals and research papers I wrote as a child
Aw, how cute
Is this like a diary?
No, that's my potty training journal
Really, your potty training journal?
Yeah
And forgive my crude penmanship
I didn't start typing until I was six
"August 7, 8:42 am This is humiliating
What was wrong with diapers?"
(giggles)
There are some charts in the back
where I kept track of shape, color
and consistency Oh!
Disgusting
No, what's disgusting is he's still keeping track
Why do you need all this stuff?
No, no, no, no Sorry!
I am glad you asked
Oh!
Yeah, are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
Of course, it is it's been in the news
And it's a very famous boson
Nice try
Now, in 1964, Dr Peter Higgs,
accomplished self-promoter and physicist,
he wrote a paper postulating the existence
of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson
Now, initially,
the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right
And now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize
Yeah, that's basically what I said Yeah
The point is Higgs is being celebrated for work
he did 50 years ago, so that
got me thinking, perhaps I've already hit
upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize
I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes
for making boom-boom in the potty
You really think
there's some kind of scientific discovery in here?
Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school
There's a good deal more to come
I didn't really hit my academic stride until I cut out
that time-suck known as "playing outdoors"
LEONARD: So, you're going to spend
hours and hours combing through all this stuff?
(gasps) That's a good point
My time is much too valuable
You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me
You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding
of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labor
Not gonna happen
Yeah, well, if I didn't think you could handle it,
I wouldn't be asking
If you want help, just hire a grad student
Maybe I could do it
You, really?
You can assess the quality of my work?
Okay, um, here
I wrote this when I was five years old
"A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non-self
contradictory set of abelion groups"
I'm just a blonde monkey to you, aren't I?
You said it, not me
Howard's capsule should be reentering
the atmosphere any minute
It'll be good to have him back
The Fantastic Four reunited! (chuckles)
Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz
We'll remember you with nostalgic fondness
The way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or
or Leonard's gym membership
We're not kicking him out
Stuart and I have become good friends
Okay, one vote for, one vote against
Leonard, you're the tiebreaker
I don't have a problem with Stuart
Besides, he gives us a 20% discount
at his comic book store
Well, I don't sell my friendship that cheaply
I can go 30
Welcome aboard, old chum
Okay, the NASA Web site says
Howard's final descent has begun
(sighs) He left a boy,
he returns a boy-sized hero
(Wolowitz screaming) (loud rumbling)
Loops, calm down!
Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you
a little souvenir from my trip to space
Well, Howard, that's very nice of you
Yeah, maybe Open it first
It's my official NASA portrait
"To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world
Just like the guy in this picture was"
For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens
and the dry cleaners are out of this world
That's not true
At the Walgreens,
I was "over the moon" for their store-brand antacids
Hey, Stuart, I see you're getting ready
for your Halloween party
Yeah, it's my annual attempt to meet women
Ninth time's the charm
Would you like me to help?
I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees
Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quois
How much for just quois?
You know, you don't worry about money
I'll take care of everything Really?
Yeah, you'll love it Ain't no party like a Koothra-party
But you know what wasn't a party?
That hotel in Kazakhstan
they put you up in before the launch
I mean, it's your last night on Earth
You'd think you'd get one porn channel
Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic
and use it to remind you that he went to space?
Interesting hypothesis
Let's apply the scientific method,
perform an experiment Okay
Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?
Anywhere but the Space Station
On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf
But, hey, you don't go there for the food,
you go there for the view
It's fascinating
Let me see if I can duplicate the result
Howard, I've always thought
the lemon was an underrated fruit
Care to weigh in?
Not really
Oh, well
You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon
But, hey, that baby got me to space and back
Try to keep up, Howard!
I'm killing it!
Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs
as we do right now
Don't worry, this is exactly how you look
when you're dancing in clubs
You're welcome, ladies
Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen!
Dude!
I was about to Bollywood this bitch
Earlier today, I invited
Professor Stephen Hawking to join me
in the popular online game Words with Friends
Moments ago, he accepted my request
Do you understand what that means?
That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying,
"Damn it
I meant to click no"
I'll walk you through it
The game is not called Words with Strangers
No, it's not even called
Words with Acquaintances
It is called
Words with
I'm not finishing your sentence
You pulled the plug on my funk
Friends!
It's Words with Friends!
Which Stephen Hawking and I
officially are
Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide;
I'll have everything I've ever wanted
since I was six years old
That's really nice, Sheldon
I'm happy for you
And I'm happy for you, too
You are now friends with someone
who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking
Enjoy it, boys
You may have peaked
Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking
I worked with him
And if they ever come out with a game called
Words with People You Once Worked with,
you'll be off to the races
Sheldon, I don't think this actually means
Hold that thought!
Professor Hawking has made a move
Boy, oh, boy
Oh, it's only a matter of time
before we're coming up with fun nicknames for each other
I'll be Coop
He'll be Wheels
If he's okay with that
All right
Crank up the AC, boy!
It's gonna get hot in here!
Hello, I'm Dr Sheldon Cooper
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags
Before we get started, I'd like to announce
the winner of our design your own flag competition
But I can't
The only entry was from GameyGamer75,
and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks
Now this week we have a very special episode
where we explore the flags
of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek 
And to help me, I'm pleased to introduce
Internet personality,
former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation, 
and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized
in 1/16 scale-- set phasers to "fun"
for my friend, Wil Wheaton
Hi, Sheldon Thanks for having me
I'm happy to be here
Cut
What's wrong?
Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always
Wil, that was a little wooden
Wooden?
Don't worry, it wasn't terrible
Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound
And action
My friend, Wil Wheaton
Hi, Sheldon Thanks for having me
I'm excited to be here
So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
Well, this is an exciting one
This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets
Now what's interesting about this flag Cut
What was wrong with that?
It's called "Fun with Flags"
They're not at half-mast, nobody died
Let's try and keep it upbeat
Um, no offense,
but I've been acting since I was a kid
I think I can handle a Web show
without a lot of direction
It's true
In 1982, Wil played the voice
of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH 
You moved me
You'll have to forgive me
This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good
So do I
Great So, this time let's try
more real boy, less Pinocchio
And action
And cut
You realize that I'm doing this for free, right?
Yes And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth
Let's try it again
Everybody's having fun
And action
So, Wil
what do you have for us first?
Well, this is an exciting one
This is the flag
of the United Federation of Planets
Cut
Problem, first-time director?
Oh, none that I could see
I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do
I got goose bumps
He was overacting on purpose
Really?
He reminded me of a young William Shatner
Listen, Sheldon, I'm really happy
to do this for you, but not if she's gonna be
a huge pain in the ass the whole time
You gonna let him speak to me like that?
Well
you're my girlfriend
and I don't want you to be upset
Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend
and I don't want him to be upset
Hmm
This is a sticky wicket
What do you think?
Can I speak to you for a second?
I'll be right back
Feel free to play with yourself
I don't care for your friend, he's being rude to me
You need to ask him to leave
Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave
He's a minor celebrity
Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him
Fine Then maybe I should go
Could you? That would solve everything
You are the best 
I'll see you at dinner tonight?
You sure you wouldn't rather have dinner
with your friend Wil Wheaton?
Come to think of it, I would!
You, little lady, are on fire
What are you drawing over there?
A hypothetical containment field
for a Frisbee-sized wormhole
that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe
Oh, you silly doodlebug
You know, a lot of scientists believe
that making contact with other life-forms
would probably not end well for us
It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard
You can block it with a Frisbee
Calm down
Do you expect me to build this?
I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin Gentlemen
Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon
always disappears every day at 2:45?
Really?
He probably just goes to the bathroom
Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom
at 8:00 am with optional follow-ups
at 1:45 and 7:10 on high-fiber Fridays
It's sad that you know that
Oh, that's just the tip of the sadness iceberg
I'm looking at his public calendar
2:45 to 3:05, nothing
Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05, nothing
Last week, nothing
Last month, nothing
He never has anything booked during that time
20 minutes a day, completely unaccounted for
We should figure out where he goes
Ooh, this is exciting
Like one of my classic
murder mystery dinner parties
Right, the case of who murdered
three Saturday nights of my life?
Colonel Koothrapali in ten
with the olive spread
It was tapenade and you guys suck
They are not
They are, too
Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed
by all the data
You're just clinging to it
out of intellectual stubbornness
No, you're displaying a shocking ignorance
of the subject matter
Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing
Oh, yeah?
Mummies are wrapped in bandages
That's called a fashion choice
All right, you brought this on yourself
Sheldon, get him
If a zombie bites you,
you turn into a zombie
However, if a mummy bites you,
all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite
So, like a zombie,
that's been eaten from the waist down,
you, sir, have no leg to stand on
Good boy Here's a cookie
Oh, thank you
Hey, fellas, what's going on?
Mummies and zombies again
Oh, they're not the same thing
You get a cookie, too
Thanks
Guess who picked up his new car this morning?
Congratulations
- Does it have that new car smell? - Yep!
For as long as I can keep my mother out of it
If you want to check it out later,
it's parked right out front, space 294
I'm sorry 294?
- Yeah - That's my parking spot
Why do you have a parking spot?
You don't have a car You don't even drive
It doesn't matter
That's my spot
Maybe they reassigned it
because you never use it
Well, I'm not using my nipples, either
Maybe they should reassign those
Sheldon, someday, if you get a car,
I'm sure they'll give you another parking space
Well, I don't want another parking space
I want my parking space
It's perfect
I-it's a corner spot,
cutting the risk of door-dings in half
It's a mere 28 steps
from the building entrance
Uh, the nearby tree provides shade on hot days
and is also home to a delightful squirrel
Which is fortuitous
because most squirrels are real jerks
Fun story
Meanwhile, you still don't have a car
Don't try to change the subject
This is about a parking space
It has nothing to do with cars
Are you listening to yourself?
I always listen to myself
It's one of the great joys of my life
Now, get your car out of my spot
Nope
Very well
You leave me no choice
What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?
Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?
Why would it trouble you?
It's, like, your third favorite cartoon theme song
It is, right behind
Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position,
lower mantelpiece assembly
onto top tabs
Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands
You're so butch
Aw, I got a little paper cut
Of course you did
Your hands are softer than veal
Oh, before I forget, Saturday I'm planning a little
Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys
Really? That's how you're gonna spend your Saturday night?
Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore
Oh, you poor thing
Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you
getting in the way of your board games?
Little bit, yeah
Oh, great! I've always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons
Yeah, oh, I'm sorry
I should've mentioned this earlier
You're not invited
Why not? Amy,
from time to time, we men need to break free
from the shackles of civility and get in touch
with our primal animalistic selves
By rolling dice and playing make-believe
with little figurines?
Yeah, like a bunch of savages
Saturday night?
But I've been working late all week
That was gonna be our night
But I have to go
We play as a group
If-if I'm not there, then everyone will blame you
They'll be all, "Bernadette ruined everything
She's the worst"
So, you see?
I have to play Dungeons and Dragons
for the marriage
You're an idiot
I'm your idiot
Forever
So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat
in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights
in Griffith Park, but Leonard's talking about
a big D and D game at his place
Saturday night just went from crazy to epic!
Woo-hoo!
Well, I must say, Leonard when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was skeptical
I can't blame you Tiny Twister was a complete bust
Oh, no, I was wrong The-the looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice
I've never felt so alive
Oh, hello, Alex Uh, let me go get you last night's recordings
What recordings?
Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep?
Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it's probably pure gold
So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through 8 hours of what I like to call "Sheldon After Dark"
- Hey, Leonard - Hey
Just playing a little Giant Jenga here
Oh, I know I'm the one who had to buy him the helmet
So, do you have any plans this weekend?
Well, most of Saturday's gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we're done
How about you?
Oh, I'm gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time
Ooh
That's his take on John Wheeler's quantum foam That should be great
Well, if you want, you can come with me
Ah, I'd love to, but I'm supposed to hang out with Penny
Well, bring her
Well, she's not really into that kind of stuff
Yeah, Okay
Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or
you know, over dinner sometime
What?
Je-Jenga, I win!
Subtitles downloaded from wwwOpenSubtitlesorg
Oh, come on, that can't be true
I did the research
Tony the Tiger, Dig'em the Frog, Cap'n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula
Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop
Not one cereal mascot is a girl
It's a total breakfast sausage fest
Are we done with this?
Almost Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz
Terrific
Something weird happened and I don't know what to do about it
What's going on?
Sheldon's assistant asked me on a date last night
How could you do that to me?! You know I've been working it with Alex for weeks
Working it? You can't even talk to her
I talk with my eyes
You look like my little cousin when he's dropping one in his diaper
She knows I have a girlfriend
It's so weird
Oh, my God You're loving this
To my bones
I mean, I'm not gonna do anything about it I love Penny It's just nice to have a young, attractive woman
sniffing around the goods
I both hate you and want to be you
This is Ryan Gosling all over again
Aw, gentlemen
What is on the conversational menu this morning?
Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only 6 to 8 months away from making my move
I didn't steal anyone
Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it
Ye-- Well, that's not acceptable See, I'm her boss
She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality
I'm androgynous?
Ye-- Oh, please Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips
What do you guys think I should do?
I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny
I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good
Oh, I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice
Uh, in the past, I've reached out to each of you individually, but
I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group
ye-- which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts
I have dubbed, uh Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies
What is happening?
I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation
Uh, to protect those involved, I'll be changing their names
Hmm, who's involved?
Well, it-- Uh, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine uh, who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate
Uh Le-let's call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally
You're talking about Leonard
You wha-- No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair
and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy
Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend
Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady
It's your assistant Alex, isn't it?
Ye-- Wha-- No
No
No This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia
Wait, what the hell's going on with Leonard and Alex?
Yo-- I-- No, I'm sorry Who's talking about Leonard and Alex?
W--
Fine It's Ricardo and Tondelaya!
Wait, Okay, look, it's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya It is really about her boss
who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice
which is surprising because Dr Einstein Von Brainstorm
He's usually pretty smart about these things
Ugh! I'm gonna kill her
I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about Leonard would never cheat on you
She's right
But say the word I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose
One of them could end up in the backseat of her car
Or her shower
Okay, Ladies, ladies, please We're not here to talk about Penny They're here to talk about me
D'uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainst-- Oh, darn it!
All right, I guess the cat's out of the bag
Let me explain what's going on
- Ricardo is really Leonard-- - We know what's going on, Sheldon!
Well, what should I do?
Well, Alex is your employee If she's doing something that's making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her
D'oh, no, he's not uncomfortable at all
No, he's loving it Yeah, w-- He's strutting around like he's 5-foot-6
What? He's loving it?!
Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away
Talk to her? Well, that's all you've got?
Ye-- With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies, I really expected more
Give me back the T-shirts
Alex
Check my schedule What's-- What does my afternoon look like?
I think it's pretty wide open
Oh, wait Here's something at 4:00
"Give Alex a talking to"?
W-well, that snuck up on us, didn't it?
Is there a problem?
You get me wrong Let's not call it a problem
Let-let's call it an opportunity
To solve a serious problem
What did I do?
W-- You don't know? Oh, you poor dear
But, your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don't even know which way is up
You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr Hofstadter
What? I didn't make a sexual advance on anybody
You-- Now, there's no need to get defensive
Look, I'm not unsympathetic to your plight
You-- My father used to say
that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day
What?
Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time
This conversation is making me uncomfortable
Yeah, you and me both, sister Now
please understand 'f-- I don't hold you responsible for your behavior
if you see, from an evolutionary standpoint
you're a slave to your desire to reproduce
But during the work day
when you feel possessed by amorous intent
may I suggest that you suppress it
by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases?
Oh, let's see here Oh, yes Uh, check out this oozy doozy
I have to go
Yeah, what, now, so does this fellow, but he can't without it burning like hot soup
Hey, pretty lady
Oh, you seem extra happy
Uh, I guess I am
Any particular reason why?
Mm, I don't know, just having a good day
This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio That was pretty crazy Huh-huh
Mm-hmm Anything else?
Mm
I found this quiz online called "Which Star Trek Character Are You?" and it only took me 4 tries to get Captain Kirk
That's great
Oh It was
Hmm
- Well, I'm glad you're having such a great day - Yeah
And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl
Oh, and who's that?
What do you mean?
Oh, I just didn't know if you meant me or Alex
Um-- Why would I mean Alex?
Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it!
Wha--?
Don't play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!
I'm missing something
Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
Oh, yes Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me
All she did was get mad at you
Why would you do that?
Well, I needed advice about a woman
Well, I would've asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything
it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle
At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend
Yeah? I-- Good to know
You know, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies
Hello
I see
Y-- W-what time?
Oh, very well, then
Huh
That was the Human Resources Department at the university
Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint
accusing me of inappropriate behavior in the workplace
Oh, my God, what did you do?
Hmm, let me think
Nothing I'm a delight
Human Resources Department
Human Resources Department
Human Resources Department
Come in
Hello
Ah, Dr Cooper, have a seat
Thank you
Uh, I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you
So I've been told But I can't understand what she has to complain about
I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history
But there's string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that's for anyone
Yeah
Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity
by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia
Cancel my next appointment
This is gonna take a while
Dr Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace
Like what?
Well, according to Ms Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an "egg salad sandwich"
I don't even know what that means, but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it
Yo-- Oh! I see the confusion here
No, no, A-Alex thought I was singling her out No
I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know?
Uh, even you
You're a slave
I'm a what?
Well, y-you-- I-I'm just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle--
Whuh-ah! Ow!
You can't talk about that, either, Dr Cooper
Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I'm gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now!
Ye-- Wha-- I d-I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here
'Chieve I-- Dr Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen
You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent 2 years using university resources building a 6-breasted sex robot
You know, and-and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as "Brown Sugar"
Hofstadter
Wolowitz and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?
Yes
You-- No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn't racist It-- He's also brown
# I'm sorry Alex hit on me #
# Hit on me, hit on me #
# Sorry Alex hit on me, I'd no idea I'm cute #
Oh, damn it, you are
Please forgive me I should have told you about Alex
I don't care about Alex
Fine, I care
Okay, I hate that bitch
But what really hurt is that you liked it so much I mean, do I need to be worried?
Of course not No Why?
Because she is pretty and smart, and
when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said
- You do that? - No
Hang on
Are you feeling insecure? Because that's my thing, and if you take it away, I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship
Yes, Leonard, I am insecure
Happy?
No, not happy
Why are you smiling?
I'm just sorry I'm ye-- Just never think of you having feelings like that
- Well, I do - Why?
Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex
Good
Come here
I'll tell you a secret?
What's that?
With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk
- Can I tell you a secret? - Sure
Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we're all gonna stop
Message received
Excuse me
Hello
This is Dr Hofstadter
Okay
All right, thank you
That's weird
Getting called in to Human Resources
What did you do?
I don't know
Huh
I just got called in to Human Resources
Why?
I don't know
Huh That is so strange
Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow
Could you stop licking your ass for 2 minutes?! I have a problem here!
Do you really think you should be drinking right now?
How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?
I don't know You'd seek professional help?
I did The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee
Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?
- Sheldon threw us all under the bus - Oh
I feel like I've been called down to the principal's office
Although I wouldn't mind if Brown Sugar suspended me
From a sex swing!
This may've been a mistake
Relax Everything's gonna be fine Yeah, before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day
Uh, little tip Turn off your "I Like Big Butts" ringtone before you go in
What-- This is all your fault
How is this my fault?
If you weren't screwing around with Sheldon's assistant, none of this would be happening!
I wasn't screwing around with anyone
Oh, of course not She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles
Ah Mr Wolowitz, it's been a while
Hey, Janine Huh
How are Tom and the kids?
- Fine - Hm
You must be Dr Hofstadter
Yes, but I-I think this is all a big misunderstanding
Yeah, yeah, me, too I didn't do anything
Is that alcohol on your breath?
Howard built a sex robot
That is not true All I did was build a robot
Did it have 6 breasts?
I'm sorry, I'm a feminist Heh
I don't notice things like how many breasts a robot has
Well, hello
What are you doing here?
Actually, I came to speak to Mrs Davis
And I'm a little busy right now
D-- But I came to file a complaint
Yeah, somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace
by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature
And who was that?
Well, you, you dirty birdie
I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I'm deeply offended
Ye-- Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms
That's it All of you, in my office now!
And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you're menstruating
And based on your behavior, I don't have to
It has been pointed out to me
that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive
and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology
Thank you, Dr Cooper
Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar
so this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future
- Okay - Yeah
Now, unfortunately
uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this
So um
I'm gonna need you to take it for me
Yo-- Oh! And, uh, you'd better ace it They're pretty mad
So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex
Oh, would you stop worrying about that?
Uh-huh I can't help it But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure
or I could do something about it
So I got a course catalog at school and looked at some of the science classes
That's great
No, it isn't They are extremely boring I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day?
Anyway, I decided I don't need to be a scientist, I could just look like one
So I bought these
- Glasses? - Mm-hmm
I really don't think that's gonna change-- Oh, my God, you look so smart and hot!
I know, right? Watch this
Molecules
Okay, come with me
Where are we going?
To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses
and maybe the boots
Best watched using Open Subtitles MKV Player
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>wwwtvsubtitlesnet</font>
Hey, will you steam my uniform next?
Yeah, w
Interesting
Do you recall this conversation?
"Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer?"
"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer"
Looks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost
Hi
Here are the make-up sponges you asked for
Oh, thanks, I thought I had more
Damn, you've got more makeup than I do
You've got better makeup than I do
Yeah, I'm borrowing this
Hey, hey, hey, hey
This is my Comic-Con makeup
I love you, but there are some things
a man doesn't share with his girlfriend
That's a wise policy
I once borrowed my sister's makeup
for a costume contest
Got a terrible case of pinkeye
Yeah, but luckily, I was going as a zombie
I won second place
I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con
That was San Diego Comic-Con
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con
Is that better?
Well, it's a lot smaller
It's more about the comic books
The way these conventions used to be
before they went all Hollywood
So to answer your question, no, it's not better
Well, then why are you going?
It's a comic book convention
You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators,
even the stinky one's still pretty good
All right
Well, you guys have fun
I guess I'll see you Sunday night
Yeah Okay
Oh, hang on a second
Hold this
What was that for?
To show people when they don't believe me
Sheldon, your food's getting cold
I'll eat later
Right now, I'm suckling
at the informative bosom of mother physics
It's hot when Sheldon talks dirty
So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures,
they sculpt your head
and make an action figure out of you
How awesome is that?
Oh, let me see
Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe
You can even choose your accessories
Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler
Oh, this is neat
Think about all the action figures
we've bought over the years
It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us
Don't you think?
Yeah, if that's your idea of what's cool,
you should get one
Yeah, so, I'm out
What do you think, Sheldon?
Want an action figure that looks just like you?
Would it come with kung-fu grip?
No
Don't waste my time
You get that these are personalize action figures
Honey, if you want one, just get one
You're still out, right?
Yep
I don't know why I avoided
the Harry Potter books for so long
These are great
I just started number six
That's a good one
Dumbledore dies in that one
Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming, either
Why would you say that?
You brought up the subject
I contributed an interesting fact on that subject
It's called the art of conversation
Okay, your turn
That was a huge spoiler
Good
What is wrong with you?
If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks
Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have
another one of your hissy fits?
Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?
Yes, and I have a theory why
Because of your lactose intolerance,
you switched over to soy milk
Soy contains
estrogen-mimicking compounds
I think your morning Cocoa Puffs
are turning you into a hysterical woman
You are unbelievable
I don't know why I put up with you
You're controlling, you're irritating
There you go again-- nag, nag, nag
You're only proving my point, little lady
You know what? Screw you, Sheldon
You are the most annoying person I have ever met
What? I'm annoying?
You criticize my behavior all the time
"Sheldon, don't talk about your bowel movements
over breakfast"
"Sheldon, when the president of the university
"is giving a eulogy at a funeral,
don't yawn and point at your watch"
"Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts
'cause you think they're ugly"
You're impossible
That's it I don't
I don't have to put up with this
Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement
that says you do
Aw
Here's what I think of your roommate agreement
You pick that up right now No
Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5:
The roommate agreement, like the American flag,
cannot touch the ground
I don't care
I don't have to do anything you say because
I don't think I want to live here anymore
Where are you going?
To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard
Crazy bastard? Yes
Leonard, wait What?
Dobby the elf dies in book seven
You'll never believe what happened to me
at work today Hmm?
This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life
You're kidding Did you Heimlich him?
No I said, "Oh, my God, I think that old guy's choking,"
and then one of the busboys Heimlich'ed him
You're a hero
Yeah, that was the point of the story
Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know
if you have Thursday night off?
Um, I think so Why?
What do you mean, why? It's Valentine's Day
Oh, right
Yeah, we can do something
You could be a little more into it
No, I'm into it, I'm into it
Just, there's so much pressure to make the night special,
and it never works out
Okay, well, this time it's going to be different
Because I am like a romance ninja
You don't see it coming, and then bam!
Romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!
You know, sometimes I think I've made you
so much cooler than you used to be,
and then you go and do that
So, in conclusion,
I believe the painful sensation felt
after passing a meal of spicy chilies
is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste
I concur, but you changed the subject
What are we doing for Valentine's Day?
Oh, you caught that, did you?
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
Can I have your attention, please?
We're all here tonight because we have no one to be with
We've got to stop defining
our self-worth by whether or not we're in a relationship
We are a community, and as long
as we have each other, we're never truly alone
That was cool
What you said
Thank you
Uh would you like to, uh
get a cup a cup of coffee?
Okay
Later, losers!
So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful
not only because it's a good school
but because it totally looks like Hogwarts
That's where I fell in love with astronomy,
and now I'm an astrophysicist at Caltech,
so I guess you could say, uh,
Raj is my name and stars are my game
And rhyming is also my game
So, uh, two games
Uh, anyway, that-that's enough about me
I want to hear everything about you
I have to go to the bathroom
I go to the bathroom, too
Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit
Oh, I've had it checked out, it's nothing
Hmm! This is going great!
Mmm can I have a refill on my chai tea?
Yes
I have a good feeling about this
I should have bought condoms
Look, I know you guys don't want to do this,
but we have no choice
So, you can either bitch and whine
or we can just get it over with
I got "whine"
I got the "b word"
Yeah, well, it's in our contract
to serve on a university committee
And frankly,
this is one I believe in
Okay, here we go
Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences
Come on, if I was any good
at convincing women to do stuff,
I wouldn't have spent so much of my 20s in the shower
If you ask me,
this whole thing is a waste of our time
Helping women?
Yeah, helping anyone
People should take care of themselves
Oh, like yesterday,
when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners,
the pharmacy and the post office?
I'm not saying people can't use tools
Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam
You don't think it's worthwhile
to try to get more women working in science
I think that's incredibly sexist of you
I believe in a gender-blind society
like in Star Trek, where women and men
of all races and creeds work side by side as equals
You mean where they were advanced enough
to invent an interstellar warp drive,
but a black lady still answered the space phone?
Oh, I did spend a lot of my
shower time with Lieutenant Uhura
Howard's disturbing recollections aside,
I don't appreciate being forced to do
banal committee work
Yes, I know, you're too smart for this
Exactly
It's like asking the Human Torch
to heat up your frozen burrito
Got it
All right, I'm thinking one way
to counter bias in the peer-review process,
is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names
Like S Smith
instead of Samantha Smith
I suppose there is a history of professional women
using their initials, so as not to be pre-judged
Harry Potter's JK Rowling,
uh, Star Trek's DC Fontana
Van Nuys pole-dancer DD Melons
All right, I think we've really helped women today
Let's fire up the old Xbox
Guys, please don't make this a school project
where I'm the smart kid doing all the work
while the slackers sit back and watch
No, we're not
This time you're the smart kid doing all the work
while the even smarter kids sit back and watch
So, you think I'm one of the smarter kids?
No, you're a tool I was using to make my point
What you doing?
You said clean up
I'm cleaning up
You can't just throw everything in the closet
Hey, you can tell me
what to do or you can tell me how to do it,
but you can't do both; this isn't sex
What if someone looks in there?
They're just coming over for dinner
No one's gonna look in the closet
Well, you don't know that
What if someone's looking for the bathroom
and they open that door?
Could work out
For all we know,
there's a toilet in there somewhere
Fine But after tonight,
we need to get a handle on this mess
You know what we should do?
We should show the closet to Sheldon
Why?
Are you kidding?
He's like a savant at organizing
Everything in his apartment has a label on it
Including his label maker, which has a label
that says "Label Maker"
And if you look really close at that label maker label,
you'll see a label that says "Label"
He's our guest; we can't just ask him
to straighten our closet
No, we wouldn't ask him
We'd just show him the closet
and let the goblins in his head take it from there
Hey, guys, come on in
Hi Hi
Ooh, it smells good Thanks
And, Sheldon, I know tonight's the night you eat Thai food,
so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients
and made it from scratch
Oh, you shouldn't have
Oh, it's my pleasure
No, you really shouldn't have
I brought my own
You stopped and got him takeout?
I had no choice
He kept kicking the back of my seat
Sheldon, I've been cooking all day
Well now don't you feel silly
Show him the closet
I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies
Instead, it reverts to its asexual state
and then grows up again
We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted
to an asexual state, but the lawsuit
from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong
My point is, immortality is not
only a possibility, it is real
Only if you're this jellyfish which periodically
reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm
If I could keep my Gmail account,
I'd be okay with that
- Hello, fellas - Hey
Remember when we were trying to figure out what that smell
coming from Professor Tupperman's office was?
Yeah?
Turns out it was Tupperman
Dead at his desk for two weeks
Oh, my God That's terrible
In lieu of flowers, the department chair
is asking that everyone donate a bottle of Febreze
If we're going to change the topic from jellyfish,
I'd be okay with brine shrimp
or the history of the unicycle
Show a little compassion-- a man died
And turned into a puddle of goo
Now, we can either
sit around and cry over spilt professor, or
we can rejoice in the knowledge
that a tenured position has just opened up
I choose to do
the latter
Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous
A guaranteed job for life
only encourages the faculty to become complacent
If we really want science
to advance, people should have
chips implanted in their skulls
that explode when they say something stupid
Well, I believe people do their best work
when they feel safe and secure
If you need my nose, you'll find it firmly lodged
up the rectum of the tenure committee
You PhD's gonna go suck up like Kripke?
No
I mean, I'll apply,
but I'm not gonna stoop to playing politics
Yeah, me neither It should be about the work
And if I can't get tenure,
I'd like to see you or Sheldon get it
Raj, don't dangle false hope
in front of Leonard like that
Excuse me, but I think I'm
just as qualified as you are
Oh, dear
Penny, have you been recording shows
on our DVR again? No
Answer honestly This is not a trial
That'll come later
Absolutely not
Help me out here I can't afford another demerit
Yeah
Uh maybe we were hacked
You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately
Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop? 
I don't know
It's a fat guy on a Segway That's funny everywhere
I'm deleting it
Well, hang on
Maybe the Chinese haven't finished watching it yet
You know, if you're trying to make space on the DVR,
why don't you just get rid of
some of the stuff you've already watched?
Like, um Alphas 
No, that's the season two finale
That was quite the cliffhanger
I'm going to re-watch it before season three starts
There is no season three They canceled that show
Well, they can't cancel it
It ended on a cliffhanger
- They did - Uh, Sheldon,
there are two dumplings left Do you want them?
Dumplings?
Don't you understand what's going on here?
As a rule, no
That show ended with all the residents of New York
either dead or unconscious
Now I'll never know what happened
Well, why don't you make up your own ending?
Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea
And after that,
I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene
You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums
I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel
and give them what for
Oh, please, don't do that
No They can't just cancel a show like Alphas 
You know? They have to help the viewers let go
Firefly did a movie to wrap things up
Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book
Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season
till we were grateful it ended
I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call
Ah, don't
If they didn't want to be yelled at by crazy nerds,
they shouldn't have started a sci-fi channel
The interface is pretty simple
You put your horizontal "X" coordinate here,
vertical "Y" coordinate here
When you're happy with those, you press this button
Got it
Leonard, you'll never guess who I just found online-- Hey!
Nice shot
Eh, his giant head did most of the work
Very mature
You're lucky I'm out of Silly String
As I was saying, Leonard,
you'll never guess who I just found online: Professor Proton
(chuckles): You're kidding
He's still alive?
Yes!
Who's Professor Proton?
He was the host of this great-- Hey!
Yes!
Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton
Professor Proton hosted my favorite science show
when I was a child
I never missed an episode
He demonstrated scientific principles
using everyday objects
It was pretty cool
Aw, so cute when you use the word "cool" wrong
Like when kids say "pasghetti"
Oh, dear Lord!
Leonard, look!
He's still available for parties and events
We should hire him
Hire him to do what?
Well, whatever we want
Hang out, do experiments,
make him take 12 pictures with us
so we can make a calendar
It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him
I just used "awesome" wrong, didn't I?
Well, I'm e-mailing him right now
Do you remember his old theme song?
Of course I do
Burbank Airport, please
Vegas, here we come!
No husbands,
no boyfriends, no rules
No rules?
We're not gonna get drunk and have a six-way
with the Blue Man Group, are we?
No
So there are some rules
Fine
No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules
Thank you
Vegas!
The ladies are away, the boys will play
Anything can happen
It's gonna get crazy
Dungeons & Dragons!
I got a brand-new bikini,
so drinks at the pool are on these
I got a sexy new tube top that says "Come hither"
and a can of pepper spray that says "Close enough, Jack"
I got some old underwear I'm gonna throw on stage
at the Garth Brooks concert
I'm sorry, why old?
'Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones
and it got me nothing
I've got a brand-new seven piece set
of polyhedral dice
Hello, new dice smell
I've got my helm of lordly might,
my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting,
my inhaler of asthma
I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior
who will lay waste to all who stand before him
And I had a sensible salad for lunch,
so I can eat all the pizza I want
Come on, are we gonna sit around
chatting like a bunch of teenage girls,
or are we gonna play D & D like a bunch of teenage boys
who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?!
Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!
The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!
The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!
The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!
So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like,
20 minutes just staring into Lucy's eyes
Oh, that sounds romantic
It was until I realized the screen had frozen
Still one of my top three dates of all time
So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?
I'd love that,
but she's not really comfortable around people
Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people,
but then I learned a trick
I pretend everyone I meet
is a beloved character from Star Trek
How's that been working for you?
Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt
Leonard, I may have gotten you a job
I have a job
Yes, he does
He caters to my every whim
No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's team
is sending an expedition to the North Sea
to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes
One of their experimental physicists dropped out,
and I recommended you
Well, do you really think I have a shot?
Yeah, I've worked with Hawking I talked you up
He knows your research
I think this could happen
He knows-- Wow!
Well, now, but do you think that's a good idea?
Uh, you know Star Trek
Should a guy with no name
and a red shirt really go on an expedition?
Hey, don't discourage him
This is a fantastic opportunity
No one asked you, Uhura
Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?
What do you think? Great
I've been doing some reading about vehicular safety
Did you know that the highest number
of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
Interesting that you would bring that up
when I might go work on a boat
Well, that's the thing about factoids--
they're interesting
I know what you're doing
You don't want me going on this research trip
because you're afraid to be alone
I'm not afraid to be alone
On land
On the sea, it would be terrifying
Because of all the drowning
Sheldon
Fine, no more drowning talk
I'll change the subject
Oh Who do you think would win in a fight--
you or a shark?
Look, I appreciate your signature blend
of concern for me and incredible selfishness
If I get the chance to do this,
there is nothing you can say that's going to stop me
Very well
Things between you and Penny have never been better
I hope four months apart doesn't change anything
I should have opened with that, huh?
Sheldon, it's not a great time!
What do you want?
Hello to you, too
I'm sorry, but this is important
What is it?
Back to the Future II was
in the Back to the Future III case
and Back to the Future III was-- get this--
in the Back to the Future II case
So?
So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?
Sheldon, I got to go inside
It's getting rough out here
You're dodging the question; I knew it was you
What was that?
What was what?
This isn't a very good connection,
but it sounded like someone just released a kraken
Okay, I'm hanging up now
You know there's no such thing as a
No!
Penny Penny
Penny!
What's the matter?
Um well, I was worried
that you might be missing Leonard
And that might be causing you to have bad dreams,
like the kind you'd get if you watched Clash of the Titans 
right before you went to bed
Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?
To be honest, I did
Aw
Back to the Future II was
in the Back to the Future III case
Leonard did it
Good night
No, wait
Perhaps I should sleep here
so you don't miss Leonard as much,
uh, 'cause you're being kind of a baby about it
You know what? That would make me feel better
Thank you You're welcome
Good night
And here's another interesting weather fact
Another? Great!
Changes in jet streams can affect the speed
at which the Earth rotates on its axis,
so bad weather can actually make the day longer
Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere
Joke if you must,
but you're going to miss these moments
With Leonard home in a few days,
this was your last time driving me to the grocery store
You know, I will miss this
I'll tell you what, if my apples are mealy,
we'll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout
Heck, you can even push the cart
Please don't take my looking forward to Leonard's return
as criticism of the job you've been doing in his absence
I won't
That criticism will come later in your report card
Yeah, I didn't stay for the detention,
I'm not gonna read the report card
Hello
(screams) Leonard!
- Shh, shh - Hi!
- Keep your voice down - Oh, my God
You weren't supposed to be here till Sunday!
We finished the experiment early,
so I thought I'd come home and surprise you
Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?
I didn't tell Sheldon,
so we could have a few days alone
Oh, that is so romantic
Uh, sure, that's why I did it
Oh I just cannot believe you're here
SHELDON: Penny, it's your lucky day!
Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo
Grab your keys
So
couldn't help but notice none of you RSVP'd
to my murder mystery dinner party
Oh, yeah
We were meaning to do that
No, you weren't because it was a week ago
and nobody came!
So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed
Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference,
it was all of you
I don't think that qualifies as a mystery
We all knew what we were doing
We're sorry, Rajesh
Maybe we can do it next week
Whoa, whoa, we're not that sorry
Don't worry, I can take a hint
No more murder mystery parties
Great Thank you Hallelujah
Because I've got something even better planned
Aw! Why? Come on
Just hear me out
I'm going to make you guys
a scavenger hunt like they have at MIT
Oh
I loved those
I did them every year there
We did them at Princeton, too
Oh, that's cute
Like it's a real college
That's amusing-- I was going to say that about MIT,
but it works for Princeton, too
Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough
I always got stuck on the first challenge--
trying to find someone to be on a team with me
I guess that story's more sad than funny
I love scavenger hunts
My friends and I had them all the time
Oh, these are a little different
There's a tradition at elite universities
And Princeton
A tradition of hunts
full of puzzles that rely on logic
and obscure knowledge, science
Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store
that would sell us beer
So, uh, who's in?
I think it sounds fun Yeah, me, too
I'm in Let's do it
I'm sorry Are we really doing this
or are we tricking Koothrappali again
like with the dinner party?
("Raiders March" playing on TV)
So what'd you think?
It was good
That's it?
"Good"?
I enjoyed it When you told me
I was going to be "losing my virginity,"
I didn't think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark 
for the first time
My apologies I chose my words poorly
I should have said you were about
to have your world rocked on my couch
Anyway, thank you for watching it
It's one of my all-time favorites
It was very entertaining
despite the glaring story problem
Story problem?!
(laughing): You-- oh, Amy
What a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are
Raiders of the Lost Ark 
is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas,
two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation
I've watched it 36 times,
except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene,
which I can only watch when it's still light out, but
I defy you to find a story problem
Here's my jaw drop it
All right
Indiana Jones plays no role
in the outcome of the story
If he weren't in the film,
it would turn out exactly the same
Oh, I see your confusion You don't understand
Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip
No, I do, and if he weren't in the movie,
the Nazis would have still found the ark,
taken it to the island, opened it up and all died
just like they did
Let me close that for ya
Awkward silence
Sheldon on his phone
No touching
Somebody's having date night
It's actually steamier than it looks
Sheldon's looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables
in Renaissance paintings
Oh, no, I got bored with that
I'm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon
How do you not tear off his clothes
and take him right here on this table?
If you do that, I'll scream
Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you
That makes two of us
My new cuticle scissors will be here
in one to two business days
Come on, one
I've been invited to consult on an experiment
at your university for a few months
Isn't that great?
We could have lunch together
We could carpool
You know, riding with Leonard
has gotten a little tedious lately
Th-The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game
And he's terrible at it
I always win
So, you're okay with this?
Well, why wouldn't I be?
Well, this project would have us working
in close proximity to one another
And there's the vulgar adage
that one should not defecate where one eats
My father used to say that all the time
That and, um, "Who does one have to orally gratify
to get a drink around here?"
But what does that have to do
with you working at the university?
Sheldon, "Don't defecate where you eat,"
means don't have a romantic relationship
in the workplace
Really?
Yes
Huh
Yeah, I always took it literally
That's why I have never once moved my bowels
in this or any restaurant
Hmm
I'm relieved that you don't have a problem
with us working together
Not as relieved as I'm about to be
It's a brave new world, little lady

Are you crazy?
You don't want
your girlfriend at work with you
Hell Clam
Why not?
Hairy Fairy
I think it could be romantic
You know, my parents met at his place of work
Your father's a gynecologist
I know
What started as a pap smear turned into a date
Which turned into her working there,
which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred,
which continues to this day
Two-Eyed Cyclops
Would you please tell him this isn't a good idea?
No, no, I think it'll be great
Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work,
she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes
Giant baby
That's a Raging Ogre
Yeah, I know
I'm just saying, I'd never want to work with Bernadette
Can you imagine seeing someone all day long
and then you're supposed to hang out
with them after work, too?
Hold on We do that all the time
You and I work together and play together
Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman
Bipolar Bear
Well, I appreciate your concern,
but I won't be seeing any more of Amy than I already do
I assume we'll deduct any extra time we spend together
at work from our weekly quota
Please let me be there when you tell her that
Why? So you can see the look on Amy's face
when she hears my top-notch idea?
Please, oh, please, just let me be there
So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at Caltech?
I'm leading a study to see
if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme
leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys
Oh
If they're anything like humans, the answer's yes
Wait, you've-you've done this experiment on humans?
You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose?
No, that would be unethical
You know, not a lot of people know this,
but the monoamine oxidase enzyme
was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim
That's right
My phone is just as smart as you guys
Amy, Bernadette, Penny
Amy, Bernadette, Penny
Amy, Bernadette, Penny
He's never gonna stop doing that, is he?
I don't mind
I'm hoping to put his love of repetition
to good use someday
Hi Um
I've reconsidered
Uh, you can't work where I work
Enjoy the rest of your evening
Sheldon
I-I already signed the contract
I cashed a check
Mmm you are not going
to come out of this looking good
Sheldon, I don't understand
I thought you said you were fine with it
Well, I was
But that was before Howard explained to me
how awful it would be if he had to work
with his significant other
He said what?
Now, don't be insulted
He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious
Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband
Yeah, well, now, well keep it short
Fr-From what I gather, brevity is your friend
So, are we good here?
No, we're not good here
I am working on this project
Yeah, and you can't tell her what she can and cannot do
Last week, you told Leonard he couldn't wear
his Wookiee jacket out in public
That's different
I'm not going to the mall with someone dressed
dumb space bear
Sheldon, you don't have to worry about me bothering you
I'll be in a different building
And we don't even have to have lunch together
Really?
Yes Before all things, I'm a scientist
I'm just there to do my work and, with a little luck,
scare the living crap out of some monkeys
Hmm
You sure your mothlike personality won't be drawn
to this blazing fire that is myself?
More and more sure
Well, then, you have my permission
I didn't ask for your permission
Too late No backsies
No, no, listen to me Sheldon misunderstood
What I meant was,
if we worked together,
there'd be too much of me for you,
not the other way around
Howard, if you're going to lie to your wife,
don't start the sentence with "Sheldon misunderstood"
That's a dead giveaway
Well?
Okay, fine
I did say that, and I think it's true
I think if we worked together and lived together,
we'd get sick of each other
Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part
about him getting sick of you
For the love of God, why?!
What exactly do you think you'd get sick of?
His only options here are to fake a heart attack
or have a real one
It-it's nothing in particular I
Is it my voice? Am I too bossy?
What?
My arm is feeling numb
Nailed it
That's the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus
My point is, I'm sure there are things about me
that would drive you crazy if you had to deal
with them all day long
Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?
Oh, well, come on, I just
Where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?
Find somewhere else to sleep tonight
Oh, Bernie
If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine
I mean, really good
So, boys, how was the pajama party?
You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?
It wasn't a pajama party
It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling,
eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride 
Please, stop talking
As you wish
I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would've happened
if I hadn't tried to help you
Uh, it also wouldn't have happened
if, in the early universe,
hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common
This is fun Your turn
Gentlemen Hey, Amy
Hello
That was kind of icy
You two okay?
Oh, we're fine
As Howard advised,
she's merely respecting our professional boundaries
Smart
Take relationship advice from a man
who spent last night braiding Raj's hair
Yeah, you make a good point
It would appear I was worried for nothing
Look at her, desperately wishing
she was over here at the cool table
Don't worry, little moth
The flame will come to you
Oh, uh
on the off chance that Bernadette doesn't call back
and apologize, how do you feel
about Mexican food for dinner tonight?
I-I don't know Sounds kind of heavy
That's 'cause you always fill up on chips
And this is Dr Gunderson from Stockholm
Ah, Sweden
Yeah, home of my favorite Muppet
and, uh, second favorite meatball
Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humor is well-founded
Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?
Where are we going with this, Dr Cooper?
Oh, please, I'm your boyfriend
You call me Sheldon
That's right, I am in a boy-girl relationship
with this cute little lump of wool
Sheldon
It's a physical relationship, too
Hand-holding, hugging even on hot days
Ow
Okay, here's a new one
Apparently now we kick each other
in the shin under the table
How do you like it when I do it to you?
Not so much, huh?
Test subject D7,
aka Betsy, fear response study
Image number one: Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes
No visible reaction
Image number two: sousaphone
Still no reaction
Okay
Let's kick things up a notch
Image number three: crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys
Okay, now we're talking
Dr Fowler?
What do you want, Sheldon?
Well, I'm done with work, so
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry
Sorry Uh
Better?
Oh, baguettes
Yes, I like baguettes
What exactly are you doing?
Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys
by measuring their response to visual stimuli
So, goofing off
As I was saying, I'm done with work and Leonard's not
So good news, you get to take me home
Play your cards right,
I'll let you drive me
past the lot where the buses park at night
I can't leave now, Sheldon
I'm very busy
Besides, why would I want to do you a favor
after the way you treated me in the cafeteria?
Image number four: boa constrictor
What on earth are you talking about?
My behavior in the cafeteria
was delightful
Maybe your friend Gunderson needs
to head over to IKEA and assemble
a sense of humor
You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues
on my first day here
Image number five:
kitten in a teacup
Oh
Oh embarrassed you? You know what?
I don't have time for this Find another way home
I'm starting to get the sense that you're angry with me
Really? What tipped you off?
Couple things, actually
Your tone of voice, your body language
Get out Well, now, that
Image number six: woman giving birth
It's 9:00 Where you been?
Oh, I had to take the bus home
Fell asleep and missed my stop
Oh, no
Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?
I did not
Well, I do now
They're a lovely people
Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them
If you're hungry, I brought home
some mutton and coconut milk
Why'd you get that? You hate lamb
I was asking for directions
Apparently, there was a communication problem
I thought Amy was gonna drive you home
Yeah, I thought so, too,
but she's acting very strangely
I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus,
and he hypothesized that a tiger may have
recently run across her shadow
Although he may have just been trying to drum up business
for his brother-in-law's witch doctor practice
Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?
Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?
Yeah
But you didn't even hear the details
Sheldon
I've known you a long time,
and I'm going to tell you this
with all the love I can possibly muster
Amy's right
You're wrong
But you don't even know
Doesn't matter
But, now, but in my defense Doesn't matter
You're not listening to my side of it
Okay, fine, Sheldon What is your side?
Well
Nope, got to go with Amy on this one
Shrimp was spicy
You want a TUMS?
You got the tropical fruit kind?
No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy
Tell me about it
One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk
I'll get it Thanks
Hi
Oh, hi
I may have overreacted
Yeah, well, I didn't handle it so great, either
It's just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time
with your friends more than with me
That's not true It's not?
You spend all day together at work,
and then you all hang out at night playing games,
going to the comic book store
Last week, you two got a couples massage
So, when you said you wouldn't want to spend that much time
with me, it really hurt my feelings
Oh, wow
Yeah, no, I get that
I'm so sorry
Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf
Time with you is my number one priority
Why tomorrow?
Well, we're real close to finishing off
the new Batman game
It is awesome
Uh, you should probably go after her
Should I go after you?
No!
Thanks for getting me in trouble
Amy
Amy
Amy
Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?
I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking
about what happened earlier between us
Also, I had one heck of a bus nap
Oh, speaking of which,
do you want some mutton and coconut milk?
No
Well, I cannot give this stuff away
What do you want?
Amy, this isn't easy to say
All relationships are difficult,
but even more so when you're in one
with a person who struggles
with everyday social interactions
And frankly
who can strike some people
as being kind of a weirdo
Sheldon
you're not a weirdo
I wasn't speaking about me
I mean, honestly, there's no telling
what will set you off
You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend
Giving you the opportunity to drive me home
Breaking the ice with your colleagues
using ethnic humor, the funniest kind of humor
What's your point?
My point is, we're a couple
And
I like you for who you are
Quirks and all
I like you, too
Well, I should hope so
I don't see anyone else banging on this door
to put up with your nonsense
Not even a good-bye?
You see, that's the kind of thing
that makes people think you're weird
Poor kid
She just doesn't see it
I'm not apologizing to Howard
He can come beg me on his knees
Sheldon, too
If I see him at work, I'm just going to ignore him
All right, don't worry I talked to Leonard
He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight
Laser's warmed up
Pull!

What are you working on?
Can't talk In the zone
Do you know what he's doing?
Could be anything
Last time he was like this, he figured out
electron transport in graphene
The time before that, he was making a list
of who's allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one
Still can't believe I didn't make the cut
Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break?
Your food's ready
No, no, what are you doing?
He's both happy and quiet
It's like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time
Sorry we're so late
Bernadette got stuck at work
Great news!
A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier
and now can infect humans!
Why is that great news?
In the pharmaceutical business, we have a saying:
"Mo' infections, mo' money"
Wait!
Maybe you want to wash
your little raccoon hands first
Oh, calm down
If I had it, I'd be dead already
Guys, listen up
Can't listen, zone
Also don't care
Next week is the anniversary
of my first date with Bernadette
Really don't care
I want to do something special,
and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it
Aw, what horrible thing
are you trying to make up for?
Just putting something in the bank
for what horrible thing I do next
Ah
Look, she's gonna be back any second, so here's the deal:
I'm writing a song, and I was hoping
we could all play it for her together
Aw Oh, I love that
That is so beautiful
Sheldon?
When did we get to The Cheesecake Factory?
I've never seen him this happy before
That's because you've never seen him
on "Restock the Medicine Cabinet Day"
Look!
A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine
Wow!
I can't wait until I get a rash
Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength
I guess they really do read their mail
Hey, isn't that Professor Proton?
Oh, yeah
Look at him, just standing in line
like he wasn't moderately famous 30 years ago
Let's go say hello
Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him
I'm not going to bother him, I'm going to talk to him
He thinks there's a difference
Arthur?
Arthur, it's me--
Sheldon Cooper
You may not remember because of your advanced age
Trust me, I I remember
This is my girlfriend, Amy
Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries
His science show inspired millions of children
Hold-Hold-Hold on
You You have a girlfriend?
Yes, and I've heard so much about you
Hey look-- we're wearing the same orthopedic shoes
I can't believe I dress like a celebrity
O-Okay, I get it now
Dr Jeffries, hello again Leonard Hofstadter
Oh, oh, right, I remember your-your girlfriend
Is-Is she is she here?
No, she's not
So, what prescription are you getting filled?
Sheldon
No Wait, I want to guess Don't tell me
I wasn't going to tell you
Sheldon, come on
No, no, no I'm really good at this
All right, give me a hint
Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?
Well, given my age, that's more than just a lucky guess
Hey, Sheldon, let's go mock the people
buying homeopathic medicine-- you love that
But I'm hanging out with my friend,
and we're having fun
Look how happy he is
Hey, can I ask you a question? Sure
You've had this dart board since I've known you,
but I've never seen you play
Oh, uh, we played once
I broke a window
What window?
That one over there
Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?
Skee-Ball tickets?
Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago?
I finally decided what prize I want
Hurry up
Uh, if I still have them,
they're probably in the junk box
Ooh, what are you gonna get?
None of your business
But when you see me wearing a flower
in my lapel later,
you are most welcome to sniff it
Yup, oh here you go
Oh, thank you
Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles
Oh
Oh-ho
I forgot about this
My aunt made it for me when I started college
Aw, did she hate you?
Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater,
and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite
Yeah, I seem to be a few tickets short
Are there more in the box?
Hmm, I think I got them all
Nope, they're not in there
Well, you barely looked Let me see
No, no, no, I-I looked, and
No more tickets
Leonard, let me look in the box
Okay, okay!
I'm gonna show you what's in the box
but just promise not to flip out
Why would I flip out?
Is it a spider?
It's a spider!
No, if it was a spider,
Lenny would've flipped out
Okay, Sheldon,
I know I was supposed to return
this DVD a long time ago,
and I know we rented it
on your card
But it's been, like, seven years
and clearly nothing bad has happened
So in-in-in-instead of being
a giant pain in the ass like you always are,
what if
this one time you just tried staying calm?
That seems like a reasonable request
Although so did, "Hey, Leonard, would you mind
returning that DVD?"
I'm sorry I'll-Ill take care of it
Okay
I mean it, I'm going to
I believe you
And you're going to stay calm?
I said I would
How about that?
Sheldon's being reasonable
Yeah, it's freaking me out
I'm gonna go
The math is all there
It's not real Yes, it is
Yeah uh, look It is scientifically impossible
for a person to tip a cow
Even you, with your stocky build
and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn't do it
It's horrible Why would you push a cow over?
They're sacred
Oh, stop it
I've seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers
Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious
Look, I'm telling you I've done it, okay?
I clearly remember the cow standing up
and then the cow on its side
Were you drunk?
I was 16 in Nebraska What do you think?
I think you're the one who fell over
That would explain why the sky was also on its side
Hey
Howard Cow tipping: real or not?
Mmm I'm gonna say not
That's just based on me trying to roll
my mom over when she's snoring
Speaking of that big side of beef,
uh, she's invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house
Aw
Mmm
You know, I've been told that a bald refusal
of an invitation is rude and one must instead
offer up a polite excuse, so
I'd love to go, but, unfortunately,
that sounds awful
Come on, it'll be fun
Uh, we were actually gonna do it here
Please? Bernadette's bringing her dad
'cause her mom's out of town,
and I never have anything to say to that guy
Oh, since you put it that way, I'd love to go,
but that sounds even more awful
It'd actually be nice to not hear
Sheldon complain about my cooking all day
Yo uh, excuse me,
but every year you prepare a terrible meal
and every year I criticize it
Do our traditions mean nothing to you?
I want to go Yeah, me, too
I'm in Sheldon
Ugh, fine, I'll go
But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined,
and it's on you
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
Sheldon, did you just figure out
a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?
Did I?!
Well, that can't be right
No one's ever done that before
Except me because I just did it!
Advantage left-side competitor
Wow, you're really good at this
Well, I have an extremely low center of gravity
I'm like a pyramid
How you doing over there?
Oh, I hope it's just a sprain
I cannot walk into that ER
with another video game injury
Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?
Oh, I would, but I'm on my way out
Where? Texas
Right now?
Why?
Is someone sick? Yes
My sister's uterus came down with a baby
Oh, she's pregnant? That's great
You're gone an uncle-- Uncle Sheldon
No, I will be Uncle Dr Cooper
How come you never said she was pregnant?
Well, I never told you about my brother's kidney stone
You want to hear about everything
that comes out of my family's genitals?
Well, congrats, and it's nice
you're gonna be there for your sister
Yes
I'm filling in for her husband who's recovering
from a horrible motorcycle accident
Lucky duck
Wow, so, how long will you be gone?
Well, she's due tomorrow
Although it did take her six years to finish high school,
so who knows?
Can I give you a ride to the airport?
Oh, no, thank you, I don't want to be an inconvenience
Chop-chop, Leonard
We leave in ten minutes
This is nice, that we all get to eat together
Mm-hmm Mm-hmm
Absolutely
Hmm
Can we maybe put the phones down
and have an actual human conversation?
We can,
but thanks to Steve Jobs,
we don't have to
Guys, guys,
you're never gonna believe this
What happened? I just got a part on a TV show!
What? That's great! Congratulations!
Guys!
Oh, yeah!
Yay, Penny!
What's the show?
Um, NCII
or, you know, NCSTD I don't know,
it's-it's the one
with the letters and I'm gonna be on it!
That's amazing Yeah
What's your part?
Um, I play a customer in a diner
and I flirt with Mark Harmon
Ooh, Mark Harmon,
he's a dreamboat
So i-it's just flirting?
Well, yeah Why?
Uh, no reason
I just think it's sexier
when things are left to the imagination
He's wrong
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:
This is just a minor setback
No, it's not, okay?
I've been out here for, like, ten years
I have nothing to show for it
Well, you have me
I do have you
Leonard Hofstadter,
will you marry me?
Did you seriously just say, "Um"?
It's an outrage I know
The university-- they think they can do whatever they want
We just have to sit there and take it
You need to let it go, Sheldon
You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get
Oh, my God!
They're just making you use your vacation days!
But I don't want a vacation
Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish
what you're going through,
but I'm a little distracted right now
Oh, this again? So,
Penny proposed, you didn't say yes,
and now you think you may have lost her love forever
How does this compare to me being forced
to relax for a few days?
It doesn't! Thank you!
I'm gonna go talk to Penny
I'm going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas,
curl up with a good book
and wait for this nightmare to be over
Penny
Sorry
Hi Hey
Look, I'm sorry I didn't text you back
I just needed some time to think
Okay Here Come in
Look, if you want to break up, just say it
Leonard No, no, no, no I take it back
Don't say it Just-just hate me, but stay with me
It worked for my parents
Listen, I don't want to break up with you
Oh O-Okay
Good, good
So, it's cool if I cry a little?
Yeah, I probably wouldn't
Yeah
Look, you did the right thing last night
I was a mess
I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere
Look, I get it, and I want you to know
that I support whatever you want to do
Great, because I've been thinking,
if I really want this acting thing to work,
I need to focus all my energy on it
And to do that,
I should quit waitressing
at The Cheesecake Factory
Wow!
That-That's a big step
I know So, you know,
before making any rash
I already quit And I support you!
T-minus 60 seconds! 
Oh, it all comes down to this!
Oh, I've got butterflies
Don't get soft on me, Hofstadter
I will slap those glasses right off your face
What's going on?
Hey We're about to buy tickets for Comic-Con
Oh
T Minus 45 seconds!
They sell out incredibly fast, but as long
as one of us gets in, we can buy passes Good Lord,
this is not the time for flirting! Keep it in your pants!
It's a whole lot of weird before coffee
T-minus 30 seconds!
Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad
Every year! I told you, wear a diaper!
And I told you I get diaper rash!
15 seconds!
Oh, this is it!
This is it!
This is it
Five,
four, three,
two, one
It's live Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Anyone in?!
No! Not yet! Nope!
Do not stop refreshing your screens!
Refresh Refresh Refresh
Refresh
Refresh Refresh
Refresh Refresh Refresh
Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee
Refresh Refresh Refresh
Item 28: your pet name for me
Time's running out on this You need to make a decision
I submitted you a notarized list
I'm sorry, but "Gollum" and "Flakey" are not acceptable
Well, you don't like "Princess Corncob""
you don't like "Fester"-- you're just impossible to please
We'll come back to that one
This brings us to the final item
in our annual State of the Relationship Summit
Item 29: Valentine's Day
Ah, the worst for last Hmm
Classic Flakey
Before you get upset, I believe I've come up with a way for us
to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy
People usually start a meeting with a joke,
but you go ahead-- end with one
I propose we spend a weekend
at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley
I hate every word in that sentence
Including "in"" "at," "we" and "a""
Come on, Sheldon Why not?
For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you
to eat with strangers at your table
One step ahead of you--
Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us
Oh, very well
What are the sleeping arrangements?
We've only been dating for three years
If we were to share a room, people might talk
I got you your own room
What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
It doesn't I know it makes you feel like you're bathing inside a monster
Look, I appreciate the effort,
but I'm still unclear how this trip
is supposed to be enjoyable for me
We're going to have Valentine's Day dinner
on a fully functioning vintage train
Vintage?
Be specific
An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive
leading a train of meticulously restored
1915 Pullman first-class coaches
Wow
I'm feeling the urge to hug you
And one and two
All right, Gollum, we're good
I'm thinking about growing a goatee
Oh, actually that's a Van Dyke
A goatee is just hair on the chin
Oh Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?
You mean a moustache?
Moo-stache! He said it!
Ha-ha, very funny Make fun of the foreign guy
For your information, there are four times as many
Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right
Say what? Moo-stache
Moo-stache! He said "moo-stache"
Guys, you're being childish
Yeah, she's right You're grown men,
the kind who are perfectly capable
of growing your own moo-staches
Hey, you were funny on purpose-- good job
Hi Sorry I'm late-- I was at an audition
Oh, I'm sorry You'll get 'em next time
How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?
Sorry How did it go?
Just shut up
Here, you can have your seat
No, no, no, stay there I'm fine on the floor
Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?
Yeah You actually do have room for one up there
Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares
The pretty white girl's there ten seconds,
and suddenly we're all running to IKEA
No one is running anywhere
We're not getting a dining room table
I know you don't like change,
but it's not a terrible idea
Yeah, you guys never use that space up there
Why not get a table?
Do you want the long answer or the short answer?
Hey, how come we never get that option?
Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system,
if the equations describing its behavior are nonlinear,
a tiny change in the initial conditions
can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result
Translation?
Waah I don't want a table!
Raj, your tag's sticking out
Thank you
That was the closest I've come to sex
in, like, two years
Now I feel a little gross
You're only making it seem more real for me
Hey, that's my wife
If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me
Can we please talk about something
other than my depressing love life?
How about Penny's depressing acting career?
Hey
I mean, it's been a little tough,
but Penny's following her dreams,
and in my book, that is not depressing
Aw Thank you
Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex? 
Is that a real book?
I would totally read that book
Can I borrow it when you're done?
Well, I'll have you guys know
I turned down a part in a movie last week
Why would you do that?
Because it was crap
It's a sequel to that awful
killer gorilla movie I was in
Serial Ape-ist? 
I thought you died in that
She does
42 minutes in
While showering topless,
16 minutes after brief side butt
during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters
I have an eidetic memory
I don't know what his problem is
Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one
They just try to clone me from my corpse,
but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA
and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet
Am I missing something,
or isn't that the part she was born to play?
Should you really be sitting in Sheldon's spot?
(groans)
He's in Texas He'll never know
I wouldn't be so sure about that
Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt
Well, it's true
Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up
Have you heard from Howard?
I did His talk at NASA went great
Sheldon didn't heckle him?
No, in fact, he was so well-behaved,
Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head
and astronaut ice cream
(knocking on door)
Hey, guys
Oh, hi - Hi, Stewart Hey, Stewart!
How's it going? Good
Sheldon's out of town, so we can do whatever we want
We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn't like
Oh, how is it?
Disgusting Do not tell him
What do you guys want to do tonight?
I don't know
Well, I told Howie if I wasn't busy,
I'd spend the night at his mom's
So for God's sake, think of something
(Stuart coughing)
Stuart?
Are you okay?
No, I don't feel so
Oh, Stuart? Stuart?
Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!
Stuart? Calling 911
Well, it's too late What do you mean it's too late?
He's been murdered by someone in this room
(dramatic music plays)
Oh, my God Oh, come on!
Welcome to another classic
Koothrappali murder mystery dinner
I'm leaving
You can't leave
You're a suspect in the mysterious murder
of Stuart Bloom
(dramatic music plays)
I didn't know his last name was Bloom
Yeah, it's Bloom
Are you really gonna lie on the floor
and pretend to be dead all night?
What do you think I was gonna do at home?
Boy, do I have to urinate
If only there were a solution to that
Seriously I feel like I've got a fish tank in my pelvis
So go to the bathroom
I can't
Why not?
Because I'm trying to decide between getting
an Xbox One or a PS4
Oh, "pee" Why'd I say that?
Forgive me for asking a stupid question,
but why are you being stupid?
I'm not being stupid
I'm employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk,
who found that people with full bladders make better decisions
Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?
Hi! Hey
Oh, how'd the audition go?
I killed it I was even able to cry real tears
right on the spot
Oh, that's great I know
Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket,
here come the waterworks
Here come the waterworks!
Aren't you gonna ask?
What is this, my first day?
I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial
gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get
I know Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star
Only without the sex
Yeah, literally, none of it
What do you think about it, Sheldon?
Meh
Are you kidding me?
This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime
How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?
Maybe it's because I'm not an elitist
What I'd like to know is:
How does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street?
You know? Wh-Who's looking out
for Joe Six-Pack and all his quantum physics concerns?
Oh, my God, you're jealous
Why would I be jealous?
Oh, I don't know Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven,
the Higgs field just got proven
and you've been working on string theory
for the last 20 years and you're no closer to proving it than when you started
Yeah, well, I've had a lot on my plate
We happen to live in a golden age of television
Excuse me, fellas
Sorry for eavesdropping, but there actually was
some big string theory news today out of the Hadron Collider
Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
No, but they did find evidence that you'll believe anything
Why would you do that?
- You're a string theorist as well - Incorrect I am a string pragmatist
I say I'm gonna prove something that cannot be proved, I apply for grant money,
and then I spend it on liquor and broads
Later
Do you think he's right?
Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
Maybe But how great is Game of Thrones? 
So, we're about to shoot this scene in the movie
where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body
Okay
But I realize they're gluing fur everywhere, except my cleavage
So, I asked the director why and he says,
it's important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape
It's sweet that he thinks there's a story
Oh, and there's not even a bathroom on set
I have to go to the gas station across the street
I mean, I was dressed like half an ape
and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there
Leonard, I could use your assistance
Sure What's up?
Well, now that I've given up string theory,
I'm struggling to find my next area of focus
So, in your professional opinion,
which of these areas do you think is the most promising?
Huh, well, I-I think there's some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter
That's helpful
- Okay Of these four areas - Sheldon!
- What did we say about being a nicer friend? - Thank you
Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?
It is just so frustrating
'Cause you're trying too hard You need to do something else Get your mind off it
Hey How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?
Hey, that's good Why'd you guys stop doing that?
You made fun of us Said it was stupid
Yeah Sounds like me
Come on, Sheldon What do you say?
All right I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday
Great! What do, what do you want to do?
I don't know
What do you want to do?
I don't know What do you want to do?
I'm starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays
Gentlemen, Star Wars day is rapidly approaching
We should finalize our plans
What? That's a real thing?
What is it, Star Wars Christmas?
No Don't be ridiculous
That's Wookiee Life Day
So, when is it?
Uh, well, it's not May the fifth
and it's not May the third
It's May the fourth
Get it?
May the fourth be with you?
"May the force be with you" Get it?
Oh, no This face wasn't because I didn't get it
Almost there You're doing great
(strained): Thanks for lifting my spirits
Next time, try lifting the box
Please hurry
MRS WOLOWITZ: I don't need a treadmill!
The doctor says you need to get exercise!
I get plenty of exercise!
Crushing my will to live isn't exercise!
If she isn't gonna use it, then why are we doing this?
She'll use it All I need is to rig it
with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham
All right
Now what?
We set it up in Howie's old room
Do you know how to set it up?
Please, I'm an MIT-trained engineer
I think I can handle
Ma, look out!
(Mrs Wolowitz screams)
I told you this thing would kill me!
How's your mom holding up?
She's doing okay, but we just lost another nurse
How many is that now?
Two, and I know what you're thinking--
she's eating them
She's just so impossible, they keep quitting
So, who's watching her now?
A bowl full of M&M's with a few Ambien tossed in
What up, guys?
Hello - Hey -Hello
Okay
Well, now that everyone's here,
Penny and I have some big news
We're engaged!
And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news
Hey! Hey!
What the hell!
You guys propose all the time
This never happens
You're right!
Previously on The Big Bang Theory 
We were worried about you
Don't be melodramatic
I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever
So a few things don't go your way
and your best decision
is to ride the rails like a hobo?
Leonard, I am overwhelmed
Everything is changing,
and it's simply too much
I need to get away and think
Sheldon
Yes?
I'm gonna miss you
Of course you are
You just made that easier
Excuse me
Is it at all possible
that you're knitting a pair of pants?
Oh, well, no, you're understandably terrified
But, you know, allow me to explain
45 days ago, um, I embarked on
a railroad journey of healing
because my university
was making me do string theory,
and my favorite comic book store burned down,
and when my roommate got engaged,
my girlfriend wanted to move in with me,
which was no doubt a ploy just to see my--
well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts
Uh, sir, may I use your phone?
I don't think so Yeah, well,
I understand that I'm half naked,
but there is a reasonable explanation
While I slept in my sleeper car,
all my possessions were stolen
Now,
typically, I wear pajamas,
but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle
and pajamas are the sleep-pants of the Man
I'll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants
and a nation rallied behind him!
My good man
Now, before you walk away
I know that I may appear deranged,
but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist
Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion
Go ahead, ask!
Bosons have integer spin,
fermions have half-integer spin!
My legs are getting cold!
Why won't anybody help me?
I recently read that during World War Two,
Joseph Stalin had a research program
to create supersoldiers
by having women impregnated by gorillas
What a sick use of science
Hey, as long as the baby's healthy
I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals
Hippos are the deadliest creature
A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass
Yes, but when they're hungry-hungry,
you can stop them with marbles
Yeah, the correct animal
for interspecies supersolider is koala
You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked
But half-man, half-owl could fly
The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses Moving on
So, Penny, when's the new job start?
Next Monday
Did you get a chance to look over
the materials I gave you?
Uh, not yet, but I will
Great When?
I said I'll get to it
I'm sensing awkwardness, am I right?
Yes
Swish
I don't want to be pushy,
but you've never done pharmaceutical sales before
It seems like you could use this time to get a head start
Well, the first few weeks will be all training
They'll tell me everything I need to know
But imagine how impressed they'd be if you showed up
already familiar with the material
Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher's pet?
Couldn't hurt
Mm, I don't know
Who here has ever been hurt
because they were the teacher's pet?
It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms McDonald
to forget the quiz
So, how does this game work?
I just throw it, like a real ball?
Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate
All right
You suck, Wolowitz!
What's that about?
I'm heckling you
It's a beloved part of baseball
He's right
And given that you're probably still waiting
to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade,
I'm sure you do suck
Hi What's going on?
Baseball
Okay, this is not what I meant when I said
go outside and play
He's practicing
For what?
The Angels wanted an astronaut
to throw out the first pitch,
so guess who they called?
What, you? Really?!
Well, a lot of people who weren't available, but then me!
That's so cool!
Congratulations
I guess that makes you the athlete of the group
Well, not just him!
May I remind you that you're talking to the seeker, beater,
chaser and water boy
of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team
I know
Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick
between his legs isn't something you forget
C'mon now, throw one
All right, here we go
You look like a jackass!
Cut it out! You're hurting my feelings!
Now you know why we're not outside
Have you guys heard about this research team
that's trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA
to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?
Oh, I think that sounds wonderful
What? You're afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens
Yes, but tell me
a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich
wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot
Hey, guys Hey Hello
We still on for tomorrow night?
Yeah I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend
Yeah, oh, and speaking of which
According to a recent study out of Oxford University,
when someone takes on
a new romantic partner,
that person loses one or two close friends
Since when do you read social science?
I go to the bathroom like everybody else
Why would I lose friends
just because I started dating someone?
Yeah, you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy
Yeah, well, no, the study refers to romantic partners
Not the way I would categorize the two of us
You guys kiss and hold hands
I've seen him do it It's not romantic
Look, I'm not the kind of guy
who drops his friends just because he's in a relationship
What happens if she doesn't like us?
Well, hey, you're my dear friends
You'll get a Christmas card for a couple of years,
and then you're dead to me
English Subtitles (HI) [MP4] The Big Bang Theory S08E05 (720p) The Focus Attenuation HDTV [KoTuWa]
Hey, I read that someone invented a way
to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy
so you can charge your cell phone while walking
We had that idea years ago
How come we never did anything with it?
Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant,
and none of us wanted to walk back
I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea
You thought of it
September 22, 2007
Two days later, Penny moved in,
and so much blood rushed to your genitals,
your brain became a ghost town
That's not what happened
I remember it distinctly
because I had just composed my annual poem
commemorating the anniversary of Dr Seuss's death
No one wants to hear it
Why, die
Why did he die?
Old, told
I was told he was old
Penny is not the reason I didn't pursue that idea
Oh, really? Since meeting her,
what have been your greatest accomplishments?
KOOTHRAPPALI: Easy
Sleeping with Penny
Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him
Tricking Penny into getting engaged
And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up
I think someone owes me an apology
Well, don't feel bad
I think we've all been distracted
since the girls entered our lives
You admit Amy's a distraction?
Oh, very much so Listen to this
This is from two days ago
Hi Hope you're having a good day
Who has time for this constant sexting?
Well, maybe we have lost our focus
It wouldn't kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas
Ooh, we could have one of those retreats
Like our own science retreat
My cousin has a cabin out in the woods
I'm not going to a cabin in the woods
Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods? 
Then we'll go to a hotel
A hotel? Did you see The Shining? 
KOOTHRAPPALI: We could go up
to Big Bear and get a house on the lake
Did you see The Lake House? 
Nothing bad happens in The Lake House 
Yeah, well, no, not to them To me
Time traveling mailbox
The only time that traveled
was an hour and half of my life down the toilet
Fine Then we'll just stay here and do it
Well, you didn't suggest a beach house
You would go to a beach house?
Well, good Lord, no have you seen Jaws?

I like your suit
Oh, thanks Got a couple new outfits for work
How does it feel knowing your fiancée's job
is to go out and flirt with doctors,
looking like that, while you sit here, you know
looking like this?
She doesn't flirt with doctors
Yeah It's all very professional
You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?
Okay, good
Speaking of new careers, how are things going
with dark matter, Sheldon?
Oh, yeah, I'd have to say it's the most exiting time
in the history of the field Oh
What's going on?
I started doing it
KOOTHRAPPALI: You know, the government funded
the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter
Oh, yeah,
I've read about that they're sending research teams
down into abandoned salt mines You know, Sheldon,
if we apply to be one of those teams,
we could be on the ground floor of something big
not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well
Wait, hang on you guys are gonna work in a mine?
Why not? You had
a panic attack when we went through the car wash
Perhaps the emotion you're referring to was shock
at you having something cleaned
I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two
in a mine is kind of funny it's like a cat riding a Roomba
(laughs)
If they get scared, they'll have those hats
with the lights on them, 'cause down there
it's night-night all the time!
Maybe they could
ride around in one of those mine carts that go,
(squeakily): Ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo
Yeah, it'll help them get away when they see a gh-gh-ghost!
Are they making fun of us? Yup
I miss the old days when I couldn't tell
So, what are you working on these days?
I'm studying one-celled organisms
to try and find the neurochemicals
that lead to the feeling of shame
What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear
Speaking of underwear,
I have some interesting news
Okay, if it's sometimes Howie wears yours,
Leonard already told us
He was being funny
I'm pretty sure
Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article
about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California
Isn't that cool?
I think it's awful
Why would you say that?
Bernadette is a successful microbiologist
She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks
I mean, what kind of message does that send?
I think the message is-- "check out the rack on that scientist"
Why can't someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?
I just don't think a professional woman should have
to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead
Okay, what's the big deal?
Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician,
I don't think it hurts to flirt a little
I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm,
maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know,
to wake up the girls
Maybe it's different in the world of sales,
but it's already hard enough
for women to be taken seriously in science
I was kind of excited about the article,
but now you're making me feel bad
No, I think you should do whatever you want
You know, maybe if fashion magazines had
female scientists in them,
I would've become a theoretical physicist
Stop smirking at each other
Oh, hey, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night
Uh, yeah, she loves that place
Every time they flip a shrimp in the air,
she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it
That's why I don't take her to SeaWorld
I know you-you don't want to hear it,
but she was there with Stuart
That's fine
I don't care
It doesn't bug you when they go out on dates?
They're not dating
They're just two friends who went out to dinner
And then went back to the home they share
where they probably fell asleep
in the matching pajamas she got them
because they both just love penguins
Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas
who aren't dating
Like who? Like you and your dog
Don't rule out the dating
Fine, it bothers me
You happy?
You think you've got problems
The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified
as a great ape
How is this helpful?
All the non-human apes are classified
as great apes except one
That means taxonomists created the entire category
of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon
as the weird kid on the playground
Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef
But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as
It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon
True
Sorry, kid, you've got it worse than a gibbon
This is an easy one You love this guy
Me
Come on, he's an underappreciated genius
Still think it's me
It's not you
Now think, there's a car named after him
Of course there is
The Mini Cooper, 'cause it's me
How about this:
he's a poor man's Sheldon Cooper
Oh, Tesla
- Hi - Hey! - Hello
How'd it go? Oh, not fun
The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses
Yeah, I watched It was like the scary boat tunnel
in Willy Wonka 
Did they figure out what's wrong? Yeah
It's a deviated septum
The surgery to correct it is simple
He's gonna do it next week
Why would you have surgery?
Because I can't breathe
I snore, I get sinus infections
Yeah, back off, he's all mine
But you don't have a life-threatening condition
Why would you take the risk of surgery?
Sheldon, it's a routine procedure
I've heard you complain about his snoring
We Yes, for the first five or six years,
but I've gotten used to it
It helps me sleep
He's like my mucus-powered white noise machine
Sheldon, I'm gonna get the surgery, it's no big deal
End of story
Very well I'm done talking about it
Thank you
I believe it was your turn in the game
Okay
Let's see
Oh, this person is most famous
for never having gotten
his nose mutilated with elective surgery
and never living the rest of his life in the shadows
as a hideous, disfigured freak
I think you could give a better clue
I don't
I'm not even sure if that's a person or a typo
Hello I'm Dr Sheldon Cooper
And welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags,
the Final Episode Flagtacular
I knew it was coming Still scary
Now, I'm sure you're thinking, "The final episode?
Who will stand between us and flag ignorance""
I know I was thinking that
Is this a show on flags or mind reading?
But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career,
a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend
And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board
So as they say, all good things must come to an end
233 if we include the one
somebody forgot to press record on
You said you weren't gonna bring that up
And you said you pressed record
Anyway, please sit back, relax,
and join us as we take our final lap
as indicated by the waving of this racing flag
And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender,
the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan,
but I'm sure you remember that, from episode sixty-two
"White Flags: Who's Wavin' 'Em and Why?"
That was a good one
It was so good

Hey, how are things going with your parents?
Not great They hired divorce attorneys
You know, speaking of attorneys,
if I ever needed a lawyer,
I would not hire She-Hulk
You know what? That was almost on topic
I'm gonna say, "Good job, Sheldon"
Wait, She-Hulk's a lawyer?
Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York
Yes, but she's the only monster at the firm
Between you, me and the wall,
I think she's an affirmative action hire
Anyway, Dad's gonna be here in town,
so I won't be able to do Christmas dinner this year
If you're not up to hosting Christmas dinner,
I'm happy to do it
You can even bring your father
That would be nice
I've always wanted to do
a traditional Victorian Christmas
Parlor games, goose and figgy pudding
Ugh!
English pudding
Y-You get yourself all excited for pudding,
and here comes a cake with raisins in it
I'm not going
You're going
Why do you hate me?
I don't hate you
I love you
Well, you call it love,
but it has a lot of raisins in it
Amy, good luck getting these guys excited
about a dinner with a theme
I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving
I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice
I agree Why not?
Me, too
You guys suck!
What color would you like to be?
Well, I'd like to be green, but you know you always take it
That's not true
Any color's fine with me
Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow
Blue and yellow make green
Well, then it's settled
Hi Ready to go?
Oh, good news, we ordered lunch,
so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk
Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight
Oh, no, we'll still be playing it tonight--
this game can easily take eight hours
Sweetie, you really thought I'd want to do this?
No Well, did you tell him that?
Yes Did you say it out loud with words?
No
I don't want to spend the whole day playing a board game
Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear
that this is the new expanded edition
which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth,
now including the Haradwaith Territories
I will literally race you to the car
No, no, no, come on, don't leave Just try it
No We're always doing what you guys want
Just once, it'd be nice if you did something we wanted
You want to be green?
You know, they really have tried to like
a lot of the same stuff we're into Yeah, we do game
nights and video game nights and we watch movies
with director's commentary
Oh, my favorite-- George Lucas can talk
all the way through Star Wars, I say one word
and I'm banished to the kitchen
Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding
what we're all gonna do
You got it, you girls are in charge
Thank you Sheldon?
Fine
Now that we're not playing, you can be green
Thank you And since you're green
this time, I can be it next time
All right, let's see What's something fun
the guys would never take us to do?
Oh, I know-- we could go horseback riding
I actually can't
My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees
I rode a very thin pony once
On the first bump just popped right off
All right, well, what do you want to do?
There's a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire
Well, that's Wilshire's problem
Come on, you know, there-there's
got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate
Hang on, why do we have to hate it?
Three words: Doctor Who convention
I-I did not force you to go to that
You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie I went
so you didn't get beat up
I wasn't gonna get beat up
You were, but somehow I held myself back
You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating
The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma
and it plays right into my well-known fear of
getting flattened by a Zamboni
Now you're helping them find ways to make us miserable?
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, I'm a problem-solver, it's what I do
I actually can't go ice-skating
I have unnaturally brittle ankles
Is there any part of your body that's normal?
Okay, we're headed out-- See you later
Before you leave,
could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?
Yeah, sure
Okay
Go ahead
Hello, can you hear me?
Sheldon, I haven't changed the filter
in the water pitcher in two years
Uh, Bernadette's nickname for you is the virgin piña colada
Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph
Yeah, well, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall,
so I used your toothbrush
Ooh, and one time when you were asleep,
Amy totally took off her
And that's why you're the best roommate ever
Aw
Now I'm sad I didn't hear it
So what do you need the headphones for?
Well, I've been struggling for months
to come up with a theory of dark matter
that doesn't make protons decay
I'm hoping to finally tackle it
by optimizing my work environment
See, I've got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature
Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts
to keep my tushie toasty
And then, oh, last but not least,
this inspirational cat poster,
improved with the reassuring face
of physics renegade Richard Feynman
Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?
I don't want to talk about it
There, the place is all yours
Yeah, have fun
Oh, I will-- nothing more fun
than a paradigm-shifting evening of science
And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower
Bye
Okay
Here we go
Proton decay
Proton decay
Proton decay
Proton decay
Proton decay
Proton decay
Hey, we're home
Any progress?
How could there be?!
With these constant interruptions
I love him, but if he's broken, let's not get a new one
So, tell me about your day-- how's it going 
with the particle detector?
Wow! You remember that?
Yeah, I listen to what you say
You're building a particle detector
using superfluid helium
You know, when you talk like that,
I want to take you right here on this table
And you know from past experience
this table cannot support both our weight
So, how's the detector going?
Well, it's tricky working with superfluids
Whatever container you put them in,
they kind of creep up the sides
and crawl out all on their own
Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm
Exactly, except you don't have a lunatic running around,
yelling, "I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me?"
Come on, this is boring-- you really want to talk about this?
No, I do
I-I didn't write "superfluid helium"
on this napkin for nothing
Okay, well
This is cool
Uh, there's a thing called "superfluid vacuum theory",
where empty space is imagined as a superfluid
with all of its qualities--
viscosity, density, surface tension
Hey, if you're pausing for dramatic effect,
I'd keep it moving
No, no
People don't talk about surface tension
If you imagine our three-space as the surface
of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble
This is exciting
This is really exciting
I have to go find Sheldon
Okay, well, if you find him,
use the kitchen island--
that coffee table will not support both of you
Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid
shows the same negative-energy density as space-time
So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?
Hmm
What? Is it wrong?
Have you seen it somewhere else?
Hmm
I know this isn't my area,
and I could never do the math like you can,
but could this be something?
Well
You could have set Newton's gravitational constant to one
And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry
You know I can't stand these scented markers
No one told you to taste them
Come on, is-is this good or not?
It's good
Really? I like it
I think you're on to something
You do? You're not messing with me?
Not at all
In fact, I have got something
for just such an occasion
I was starting to think
I might never get a chance to give it to you
Good job
You're giving me a sticker?
Not just a sticker
That is a sticker of a kitty saying, "Me-wow!"
I'm not a preschooler
Fine, I'll take it back
I earned this! Back off!
I've invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?
Sure
How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
How many?
Who cares? He stole the idea
and doesn't deserve his own joke
Is that really true?
Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke
It not only entertains, it informs
Hey, sorry to interrupt
Uh, Barry,
uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Did you know Edison didn't actually invent the light bulb?
What do you want, Barry?
Just wanted to drop this off as a little thank you for Amy
What's this for?
Your idea really helped me out
My light-cone quantization paper's online already
The response has been amazing
Well, that's fascinating
I can't wait to read it
Oh, no, me as well
Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon@Bazingabiz
Why "dot-biz"?
Because I just gave you the business
And also Bazingacom was taken
Anyway, thanks again
Cooper, suck eggs
Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?
Well, I'd been thinking about a cellular automata approach
to neuronal connectivity,
and I thought it might have some interesting applications
to string theory-- it's not a big deal
Oh, really?
When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end,
why didn't you try to help me?
I did-- you said the only math biologists know is
if you have three frogs and one hops away,
that leaves two frogs
That's pretty funny, that does sound like me
But that doesn't mean
that you should be standing on street corners
handing out your math to whatever guy comes along
Sheldon, we're all scientists
I helped out a fellow colleague
You're being petty
I'm being petty?
You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry
You heard him-- he told me to suck eggs
If we were friends, he would have suggested
I suck something more pleasant
Why are you laughing?
Did you learn something?
I just read about an experiment designed
to see if you could make two people fall
in love in a matter of hours
That doesn't sound right
My research has shown that it takes three to five years
of shameless begging
Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story
Yeah, I-I
I saw that article you're talking about
Uh, the participants ask each other a series
of questions designed to promote intimacy
And then they finish it off by staring
into each other's eyes for four minutes
Oh, that's nonsense
I proclaimed my love for you
And the last time I looked into your eyes
was when you thought you had conjunctivitis
Other than the fact that I had it,
that was a magical night
Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?
What? I don't need science to win her heart
I have my family's wealth for that
I'm telling you, you can't create love in a few hours
Right? Oh, careful
You're poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor 
Yeah, but
we don't have to debate this
We're scientists
We can conduct our own research
Yeah, I propose that we imprison
two street people No
And
You didn't even let me finish
Forget it! Oh!
So, you can experiment on all the apes you want
But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive
human beings, suddenly I'm the monster
Why don't you
just do the test?
In the interest of science, I'd be willing to
What? You're okay with an experiment where you have
to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
Yes
Please, can I do it with him? Please?!
I've been listening to Sheldon's feelings on things
for ten years Tag, you're it
Yeah, but what if the experiment works?
I'm not gonna fall in love with Sheldon
That's what I said
Before I knew it, he pontificated his way
right into my heart
Uh, fun fact-- "pontificate"
comes from the Latin word "pontifex,"
which means "bridge builder" or "Pope"
In love yet?
I was unstoppable
I mean, I was I was on fire
It was like my mind and my body were totally connected,
like-like athletes must feel when they're in the zone
Again, it was miniature golf
Admit it, you're a little turned on
You can't be this proud
Why not?
Because I beat you
Hey Hi
Oh, good You're back
We have some exciting news
Okay
As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time,
and a lot of things
I never thought possible now seem possible
Okay
After a careful evaluation of our relationship,
we decided that the time was right to take a step forward
Okay
Do you want to say it?
Let's say it together
We're getting a turtle!
This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice
Sarcasm?
Yes Okay
That was tricky, 'cause when it comes to alcohol,
she generally means business
Well, we're-we're very happy for you
Yes
Thank you
Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us
No It's true
It means that we care so much about each other,
there's enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile
Why a turtle?
After much deliberation, we've determined that a turtle
is the ideal pet
They don't shed fur, they don't make noise
For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone
Yeah
And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him
Coincidentally, that's also why I chose you as a roommate
Well, congratulations
Who would've thought you two would be the first
in our group to start a family? Mm-hmm
That's what I said!
Two one six four two zero
one nine eight nine
And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places
I'd say I'm sorry I asked,
except I didn't
Oh, look, it's the Scientific American 
that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote
Oh, let me see
I have mixed feelings about doing interviews
I like the part where I talk
I do not like the part where the other man talks
Sheldon, this article doesn't mention Leonard at all
Well, that can't be right
It only refers to Dr Cooper and his team
Did you even talk about him?
All I did was answer a few questions about the theory
And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American 
doesn't include any of those smelly perfume cards
Poor Leonard
Why? The theory he came up with
just got mentioned in Scientific American 
He ought to be thrilled
He might not be
Oh, maybe you're right
He is kind of a lump
Think about it
How would you feel if you were referred to
as part of Leonard's team?
Oh, I'd be incensed
So you see what I'm getting at?
Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
No
Grass is always greener?
Try again
Well, I don't know-- we're all Groot?
Just tell me
Leonard is as much a part of this paper
as you are, and he was overlooked
He's going to feel bad
But it wasn't my fault
I didn't exclude him
And I didn't write the article
Remember that time you didn't get picked to pull the sword out
of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
Oh, that kid!
Poor Leonard
Exactly
For the record, that kid was a terrible choice
If you cry when you drop your churro,
you do not have what it takes to rule England
Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke
for our lecture at Berkeley
Oh, I like to laugh
But say it anyway
Okay, um
What do you say to a graduate
of the UC Berkeley physics department?
I'll have fries with that
Because his education hasn't prepared him
for a career in the sciences
You know, when they chase you out of there,
you only have to run faster than Sheldon
Are you all set for your trip?
Yeah, I think so
I just restocked the old PRK
"PRK"?
Public restroom kit
Everything a boy needs for making pee pee
in new and strange places
I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack
with your own toilet paper and Purell
Keep going
And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener
Um, noise-cancelling headphones
Oh, danger whistle
Um
pepper spray
Ooh, a multi-language "occupied" sign
Uh, let's see
We have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes,
a clothespin for my nose
Oh, and a mirror on a stick,
so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me
isn't some kind of weirdo
You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?
Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?
You're wrong No, I'm not
Yes, you are No, I'm not
Settle this Those little animated pictures
on the Internet, are they called "gifs" or "jifs"?
Well, the G stands for "graphics"
That's a hard G, so I'd say "gif"
W The guy who invented it says it's "jif"
I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy ?
Well, I'll give you three guesses
why I'm so irritated
Something happened different from the way you wanted it
I guess news travels fast
It's true, a select group of scientists
was invited to a weekend symposium
at a former home of Richard Feynman,
and I wasn't included
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because they don't think
you're an elite scientist Yeah,
I bet you anything it's just 'cause you're a pain in the ass
You're just saying that to make me feel better
Look, you can spend the rest of the day
being bitter about this Agreed
I was gonna say "or", but why bother?
Hey, would you like to hear some songs
I've rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?
Sure Really?
Yeah Well, I like music, I like science,
I like making fun of Sheldon Hit it
It's, like, the best one they make,
I just can't get it to work I'll figure it out
It streams HD video straight to your phone while it's flying
Nice
Where were you when I was single?
Okay, we should leave in about an hour You all packed?
Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things--
you know, makeup, underwear, clothes
If your bathroom floor
counts as a carry-on, you're packed
Leonard, have you ever given
a high school commencement speech before?
Nope It's pretty exciting
Aren't you afraid of being blinded?
How would I be blinded?
At the end of the ceremony,
all the students throw those pointy hats in the air
It's all pomp and circumstance
until someone loses an eye
I'll take my chances
Fine
I wonder if they make
"I told you so" cards in braille
Look, the problem with commencement speeches
is that they're boring
Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?
Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?
I don't know Why do I own one?
I think it's really nice
that you're sharing this experience with Penny
Mm, I thought it'd be fun
to show her my old stomping grounds
I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me
Well, now you get to go back
as a successful scientist
With a beautiful girl on your arm
And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball
Leonard, what time does your mom's plane get in?
I don't know-- some time tomorrow morning
Don't you want to know for sure?
No need to As soon as she flies into California airspace,
I'll feel a disturbance in the Force
It's so nice both of your moms are coming in
to see you guys get an award
Well, my mother's been there for every honor I've won
since I beat out my twin sister
for the "did it on the potty" trophy
How does this look?
Aw, it's so nice She's gonna love it
Sure, his mom gets roses
When I want them,
they're a "bouquet of severed plant genitals"
You act like I didn't get you
that mushroom log on Valentine's Day
He's right
Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms
for two or three magical years
You know, your mom's never been
too thrilled with our relationship
Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me
If you could run out and get a PhD,
that might make her like you
Really? It didn't work for you
Do you think the moms will get along?
Uh, I don't know They're pretty different
Maybe they'll be best friends
One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple
Sound familiar?
Can you believe it's been five years since our first date?
I know
Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?
That's what you're thinking about?
Well, one of the things
Are any of them me?
Yes
I thought, I can't decide
if I should watch The Flash TV show
I know, I'll ask Amy
Anyway
What are you doing?
You're right, you did kind of kill the mood
I didn't kill anything
You did, talking about your stupid TV show
Excuse me
Starting to watch a television show that might run for years
isn't a decision to take lightly
I'm wrestling with
a big commitment issue here
Really?
That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with?
Sheldon,
do you understand the irony
of your fixation on a man with super speed,
while after five years all I can get out of you
is a distracted make-out session on a couch?
Irony's not really my strong suit
But I have been getting better with sarcasm,
if you want to give that a try
Oh, sure, I'd love to
Whenever you're ready
Previously on The Big Bang Theory
Well, there was this girl
What did you do?
Nothing
Really, it was just kissing
All right
So, we're still getting married?
Yes
Because we love each other
Yes
And it's the happiest day of our life
Don't push it
I need some time to take a step back
and reevaluate our situation
Oh
Bye, Sheldon
Well, Gollum
you're an expert on rings
What do I do with this one?
So, what package are you thinking?
Mm, this one comes with music and flowers
Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet
Why would we want that?
'Cause there's a lot of gorgeous blondes out there
who don't believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist
Let's give them hope
Whatever Put us on the Internet
I've always wanted a wedding with a comment section
I-If you're not into this, we can do it another time
No No, I want to
Look, we've put this off long enough
Let's do it Aw
That's exactly what you said the first time we slept together
Oh, excuse me
Sheldon
Hey
Leonard, have you gotten married yet?
No Why?
Good Don't do it! Why not?
Some important new information has come to light
Women are the worst
I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong
No piece of paper ever cut me this deep
What happened now?
Amy has ended our relationship
Oh, no Seriously?
What's going on?
Amy broke up with Sheldon
She did?
Is Penny crying?
No
No, of course not
They thrive on our suffering
Buddy, I-I'm so sorry
Is there anything I can do?
Yes If I ever talk about
going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me
like I do to you when you say dumb things
Sheldon, uh, o-okay, just because
you're going through this with Amy
doesn't mean that all women are bad
Whatever
Hey, I just heard
about you and Sheldon Are you okay?
Not really
Can you come over?
Uh, actually I'm in Vegas
Leonard and I are about to get married
Hold on
You're getting married and you didn't invite me?
Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing
Wow
Hope I can catch the bouquet from here
Amy, don't be like that
Why did I just hear Amy's name?
Penny's on the phone with her
Did she say anything about me?
Never mind I don't care
Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me
Just don't be shocked when you find out that I don't care
Okay, will you relax?
You're not missing anything special
Hey
She's upset
Look, it's gonna be a great wedding
Look at you in your little suit
Amy's upset? Is it about me?
No, I think it's because we're eloping
Your marriage is causing her pain?
Yeah, great, I take it back
Go ahead and do it Yay for love!

Hello Oh!
What are you doing here?
When last we spoke, you said you needed time
Well, it's only been 11 hours
The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours
I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity
Sheldon, when I'm ready to talk, I'll let you know
Very well
You seem to be headed somewhere
May I walk with you?
Sure
Boy, I'm glad we're going out again
We're not back together
Why?
Is there someone else?
Just couldn't wait for that first notch
on your bedpost, could you?
If you must know,
I'm going to Howard and Bernadette's
to watch the wedding
And who's this guy you're taking?
There's no guy!
Oh, you're going to a wedding alone?
That's sad
I'm not gonna be alone
I'll be with my friends
Your friends?
Well, I think you mean my friends
And why wasn't I invited to this?
Maybe because the two of us being there
would make them feel awkward
We make everyone feel awkward
That's our thing!
They're running a little behind
Should be pretty soon Okay
Hey, if you're hungry, there's a breakfast buffet
at the strip club next door
Thanks, but I don't like glitter on my scrambled eggs
I don't think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay
Look, it-it's not how I pictured it either,
but I'm still glad we're doing it
Me, too You sure?
Yes And you promise
you're okay with everything from the car?
Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?
You're right I'm sorry
We have the rest of our lives
to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it
So what do you think?
Should we run next door and grab a bite?
What if they call our names?
Oh, don't worry They gave me this vibrating coaster
Oh, and the fairy tale continues
Thank you for doing this
Our pleasure
You feeling okay?
We were together for so long,
I honestly don't know what I'm feeling
Well, that's understandable
You forgot It's called "happy"
Howard
I'm not saying anything bad
Just that she was in love with her captor
and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon
I know what you're going through
My-my last breakup was pretty tough
Oh What was her name?
Hey, it's a true story
I don't need the third degree
For God's sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?
I didn't want to come in
I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable
So I'll just stay out here
and pretend that I don't have to go to the bathroom
Howard, do something
I'm on it
Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better
I see
And is that why everybody was invited but me?
They didn't invite everybody but you
Bernadette invited me,
and Stuart lives here
Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
So, when you hear the music, that's your cue
Any questions?
Oh, the package that we paid for
said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals
Where are the rose petals?!
We're out! You know what?
It's fine
We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!
Really, we're good
Yup, just want to get married
Yeah Great
I'll see you two up there
This is it I know
I love you
I love you, too
Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?!
No, thank you! We're good!
Raj, you're probably wondering
why Amy and I aren't showing any affection to one another
Didn't even crack the top ten
Well, you should know
that she recently broke up with me
I said I needed time to think
I'm sure you guys will figure something out
You hear that? Raj is devastated
Sheldon, shh The wedding's starting
I see what's happening
Sides are forming
Well, if Bernadette's on Amy's team, I pick Howard
I'm not taking sides
Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj
Really?
At least you got picked
Before I go any further,
have either of you prepared your own vows?
Yes No
You wrote vows?
Yeah
Well, I don't have any
You're kind of making me look bad
It's okay I-I don't have to say them
No, no, no, go ahead
I'll come up with something mushy, you'll cry, we got this
"Penny, we are made of particles
"that have existed since the moment the universe began
"I like to think those atoms traveled
"14 billion years through time and space to create us,
so that we could be together and make each other whole"
Wow
Penny?
Right Um okay
Leonard, I mean, you're not only the love of my life
I mean, you're my best friend, and
you've got a friend in me
You got troubles
I got 'em, too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together, and we can see it through,
'cause you've got a friend in me
Is that the song from Toy Story? 
He loves that movie
I do
Aw, that was beautiful Yeah
I mean, not like our wedding beautiful
No, we totally won
Amy, I don't understand, are we broken up or not?
It's like you can't make up your mind
It's because you're not giving me any space to think
Well, you should think fast,
because men can sire offspring their entire lives,
but those eggs you're toting around have a sell-by date
You know what, Sheldon, you've made this really easy
You're immature, you're selfish, you just insulted me to my face
I don't need any more time to think We're broken up
Amy
Will someone take me home?
Yeah Come on, I'll give you a ride
symbolizes your eternal love
I now pronounce you husband and wife
We did it!
I'm so glad you guys could watch!
We'll say it was beautiful in the comment section
No, no, no Hang on
I believe I'm supposed to carry you across the threshold
Can you?
Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed
when he falls asleep in front of the TV?
Okay, let's do it
You gonna make it? I'm okay!
Nicely done!
Thank you
Finally, there's a Mrs Hofstadter
who isn't disappointed in me
Well, the night is still young
Everything all right?
Yeah I guess
Just tell me
It's just, when we were kissing,
I couldn't help but picture you with that other girl
Oh, no
No, come on
I have a friend in you
You said so
You're right Just forget it
Yeah
Okay, listen Uh
If you're imagining that it was sexy, it wasn't
We-we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray
The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth
Did you feel guilty?
No, she had dental insurance
Did you feel guilty after kissing her?
Yes I felt guilty as soon as it happened
I feel guilty every time I see her
What do you mean, every time you see her?
What do I mean?
Boy, that's a toughie
You still see her?
Well, no, not socially
But, you know, just at work
You work with her?!
How could you not tell me that?!
I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking!
Oh, okay So you're saying this is my fault?
No, of course not
Okay, l-look,
instead of fighting,
why don't we dim the lights,
um, get naked and make a baby?
I was trying to lighten the mood
It's not easy You try it
Hello, Mother
Shelly! How's my baby doing?
I just wanted to let you know
that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers
Unless you're open to praying for
a beehive to fall on her head
Oh, what's going on?
She broke up with me
Oh, Shelly
No, I'll be okay
But I think that I'd like
to send the ring back to you
Well, let's not be hasty
Are you sure it's over for good?
It's over for me I'm done with women
Like when I swore off Pop Rocks
They both hurt you on purpose
You want to tell me what happened?
Are you going to say it's all part of God's plan?
Good chance
Then no, thank you
Well, honey, don't send it back yet
Your sister's married, and I'm not letting your brother
give my grandmother's ring to that whore he's dating
Wasn't Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?
When your idiot brother redeems mankind,
he can date whoever he wants
I know it hurts now, but it's gonna get better
Yeah
Everything's gonna be okay
You've got so much to offer
Thank you
Any man would be lucky to have you
That's true
I just hope I did the right thing
I'm sure you did
Maybe that's the problem you always do the right thing
Maybe it's time to do the wrong thing
Like you're doing right now?
Exactly
I asked you over and over if you were okay
Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't?
I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not
Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful,
but you, you are not easy to lift!
Wow!
Well, marriage must agree with you
Well, you are just glowing
I'm not glowing
I'm upset
Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you
Knock, knock, knock, Penny?
Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?
What's this?
Leonard told me what happened,
so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage
Oh That's so sweet of you
Yeah I know
Turns out, being sweet
isn't enough to keep a girl these days
I blame Madonna
I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy
Well, I'm sorry about Leonard
Thought I raised him better than that
You know, it's bad enough what happened,
but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her
all the time at the university
He does? Who is it?
Some girl named Mandy
Mandy Chao? Yeah
Oh, you don't need to worry about her
She's brilliant and attractive
She can do way better than Leonard
That's great
Wait a minute
I know this may sound farfetched,
but I'm on the market now
You know, if I dated Mandy,
that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson
That's ridiculous
Oh, you're right I could never be with a woman
whose self-esteem was so low she'd be with Leonard
I'm with Leonard
Yeah, I know Forever
Who would have believed these things would happen to us?
Right?
I can't believe Amy actually went through with it
Hang on
You knew that she was going to end it with me?
Did you try and stop her?
I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy
Do what makes her happy?
She plays the harp and her car is paid for
How much happier can she be?
Okay, look, it's not my fault
that she thought you were a bad boyfriend
I see
Well
I think I'll be going
Sheldon No, no, no, no
We are done here
Would you mind opening the door
and then angrily slamming it behind me?
Sure
Thank you
And slam it hard,
because I am pretty steamed
All right, Leonard, hang in there
Talk to you tomorrow
What happened? They just got married
I don't know
It's a mess They had a huge fight in Vegas
Think they'll break up?
I don't know Sounds pretty bad
Penny's back in her apartment all by herself
Really?
Would you like to hear another reason
why men are better than women?
Sure, let's make it an even hundred
You would never kiss me and make me say "I love you"
and then break up with me
I wouldn't
And you know why?
'Cause you're a man
The champagne of genders
Well, I may be a man,
but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one
Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man
All you hear women say is,
"I'll just have a salad" You know?
"Where's my lip gloss?"
"I think this element should be called radium"
That last one was Madame Curie
I figured that out
You know what? She was kind of an honorary man
She had a penis made of science
Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you
Really?
I never imagined it any other way

Why are you up?
How am I supposed to sleep?
I've been married less than 24 hours,
and my wife isn't speaking to me
Perhaps you can think of this in a more positive light
In one day, you've managed to do
what it takes many couples decades to achieve
Hi
Hey
You couldn't sleep either?
Of course not
Me neither
But I just had a tickle in my throat
Not profound marital problems
What are we gonna do?
I don't know
Please, tell me how I can fix it
Glad you asked
As I see it, there's a simple solution
Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman
It seems only logical that
to restore balance to the relationship,
you should find another man and dally with him
And by dally, I mean some hardcore
mouth-on-mouth action
Okay, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard
Actually, I think he's onto something
Y-You can't be serious
'Cause I messed up and made out with a girl,
you're gonna do the same with a random guy?
I'm currently single
That's true You are
What is happening?!
I will tell you what is happening
I am saving my best friend's marriage

Would you pass the mustard?
Sure
Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?
Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavor
were evolved by the cabbage family
as a chemical defense against caterpillars?
Yeah
Well, that was fun
Good for you, Leonard
Hey, there
Hey, you're early
The movie doesn't start for an hour
Actually, we're not going to the movies
We are here to kidnap you
What are you talking about?
Well, you eloped and we didn't get a chance
to throw you a bachelor party,
so there's a van downstairs
and we're here to take you
to a surprise location for the weekend
Well, I'd hardly call this kidnapping
Where's the blindfold?
Where's the duct tape?
Where's the part
where you call me and demand ransom
and I try to keep you on the phone,
but you hang up seconds before I can trace it
and then I say, "I'm getting too old for this crud"?
When do we leave?
Right now
Yeah, Penny packed you a bag
Wow, okay
You're seriously going to get in a van and let these two
take you to an unknown destination
for an entire weekend?
Oh, not just him; you're coming, too
Oh, and how do you think you're going to get me to do that?
Unhand me!
This is ridiculous!
I told you to put tape on his mouth!
And I told you he bit me!

What a wonderful day, thank you
Oh, we're glad you had fun
Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store?
It's like I died and went to the post-mortem,
neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven
I still don't understand why you bought that pill caddie
You're a young man
Age is a state of mind, Leonard
In here I'm 90
Why are you taking your bins over there?
That's just where I need them
You know, she doesn't have a lot of closet space
What's wrong with your closet?
Uh
Well, honey, you know,
now that Leonard and I are married,
it kind of makes sense that we actually live together
So that's all this day was?
A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?
Come on, buddy No, I thought we were friends
You asked for a sip of my Icee
If you had your own straw, I might've said yes
Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this
You know what they don't sell at The Container Store?
Something large enough to contain my disappointment
Although,
if anyone did, it would be them

Hey, ready for lunch? Oh, one sec
Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?
No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit
so she can track how much I'm exercising
That'll teach her to care about your health
I can't wait to see the look on her face when I die young
When was the last actual exercise you got?
The other day, when
she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her
According to a recent study,
simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still,
can have physical benefits
For all you know, I could be exercising right now
Are you? Eh, I'll do it tomorrow
It wouldn't be the worst thing
if we were more active
Oh You make an excellent point
Ooh, I think I'm getting a runner's high!

SHELDON: Leonard
I've got terrible news
What's going on?
Before I tell you,
perhaps I should soften the blow
You're face is pleasingly symmetrical
Just tell me
A Swedish team of physicists
is trying to scoop our super- fluid vortex experiment
Oh, well, that kind of stinks
That kind of stinks?
Why aren't you more upset?
Did I soften the blow too much?
Because this here is more like a Picasso painting
What are we going to do?
Perform the experiment immediately
I'd love to, but we need liquid helium
and our shipment's on back order for a month
A month? What? Are you kidding me?
That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow
That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes
Thank you Aren't you sweet
Let's go check to see if the university
has any helium in reserve
Did you know that I almost didn't wear this shirt today?
Hey, Barry, we're in trouble
We need liquid helium-- does the department have any we can use?
Sorry, there's a shortage
And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study
But you won't need much for that
True, but if it's successful,
I'm having a party with balloons
Come on, Barry, there's a Swedish team
trying to run our experiment before us
Can't you spare any?
Be honest-- if the shoe was on the other foot,
would you do this for me?
Yes No chance
What are you doing?
He said be honest, so I was honest
Didn't your mother tell you? It's the best policy
So, what do you say?
Hell no
He could've softened the blow

Did you hear about this study that found people
that were cool and popular at 13
have problems succeeding later in life?
Hmm I'm doing okay, and I was very popular at 13
In school?
Oh, no At home
The servants would sing to me,
laugh at my jokes
I wish I knew their names
Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
You tell me-- you woke up in bed with one
Listen to this
I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton
Leonard Nimoy's son is working on a documentary
that he started with his father before he passed away
It's about Mr Spock and his impact on our culture
Hmm
Why is he writing to you?
Well, they're looking for fans to interview,
and Wil thought I'd be good for it
Oh Hey, high five
Absolutely not
Yeah, Penny,
you spent some time in front
of the camera Any words of advice?
Yes Don't take your shirt off
just because the director said so
This is a documentary about Mr Spock
I'm sure if there's nudity, it will be tasteful

Do you know what that means? No
Are you telling the truth?
Nersh 
This is ridiculous-- being upset about Amy all the time
isn't accomplishing anything
If I want to resolve this situation,
then I need to take action
What are you gonna do? I'm going to find her
and ask her to marry me
And if she says yes,
we can put this behind us and resume our relationship
And if she says no
well, then she can just ponfo miran 
He didn't mean that
I think it's so adorable you're making Sheldon breakfast
Well, he's having a rough time

Aren't you worried you're making French toast on oatmeal day?
Ah, well, what's this? A pot of oatmeal?
Or, thanks to you, what I will now call "gloatmeal"
Oh, I don't want credit for that
Oh, Dr and Mrs Hofstadter,
lovely to see you this fine morning
You're in a good mood
Yeah, I am indeed
I have decided,
instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy,
it is time that I find myself a new female companion
Oh Good for you
What brought this on?
I realized something-- when Amy was in my life,
I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her
And you don't want
to make the same mistake with the next woman
No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore
so I can hyper-focus on my work again
Hey, I made French toast sticks
On oatmeal day?
Ah, I also made oatmeal Ooh,
that's a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl
You know what? You eat it; you're married--
it doesn't matter what you look like
Don't take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow

Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts
Nice try
It only recognizes my voice Oh Cool
Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts

Now that I'm no longer with Amy,
I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet

Well, you realize you won't be going alone--
I'll be there the whole time
Providing fish and pilgrim facts
Can you people hear me?
Well, we're having everyone over
Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking

But we can't
Yeah, poor us Mm-hmm

Good-bye, Sheldon

Amy's at a conference this weekend,
which means I'm available to be entertained, hmm
As today's youth might put it: Who wants to get their Sheld-on?
Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel
We could always use an extra pair of hands

scanning for rogue planets
You're more than welcome to join me

Uh, stop selling it, kid You won
Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day
How could Batman possibly fight Superman?
I mean, isn't that dumb?
Maybe he uses Kryptonite
Well, Batman's got a lot of money
Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do
No, no, no, no, no
I've seen that movie It's called Iron Man 
What is happening?
I don't know
But it's beautiful
And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love

We could do a double feature

Oh, I love me some Leo
And it's gone
Oh, hello, everyone
I am happy to report I'm feeling much better
Good for you
My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free,
and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall
Glad to hear it
I'll be able to return to work tomorrow
Yay
Well, why isn't everyone happy?
Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again
You really don't know why? No
But I knew that his yay was sarcastic
Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement
sounded like rain on a roof

rub Vicks on my chest

I made your bed
I checked your mouth for thrush
You can rub your own chest
Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet,

I'm not even sure I've held a baby before
Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out
But how's this all gonna work?
Do we get a nanny?
I mean, can we afford a nanny?
And if we can, we can't get a pretty one,
'cause it'll wreck our marriage
We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid
I-I don't know, Howie
Are we in a good school district?
You're Catholic, I'm Jewish
What religion do we raise it?
And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised?
People say it's barbaric,
but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket
Calm down, it's gonna be okay

Well, your birthday's coming up

I guess I'm still wondering
if Emily and I are right for each other
Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
You mean the strong, sexy angel I can't stop thinking about?
Who can say?
I need to come up with a big idea to make some money
There's no reason you can't That's easy for you to say
You and Sheldon already came up
with your superfluid helium model
That's just research
We're never going to make any money from it
Forget helium-- the real superfluid
is the fruit punch in this mug
It reminds me of my daddy's secret Don't Tell Mama juice
Maybe that's an idea
Guidance systems for drunk people
They have that, it's called Uber
Hey, in your supercooled helium experiments,
did you create quantum vortices?
Yeah, why?
Well, if you made a guidance system,
couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?
Wow Never thought about that
And, since it's in a quantum state,
it would maintain an infinite persistence
Groundbreaking revelations,
tropical drinks
Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City 
Okay, I gotta ask--
why are you wearing a bow tie?
I've never applied for a patent before
I wanted to make a good impression
Oh Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?
(chuckling)
Yeah, well, you're an engineer
End of joke, burn
Come on in, fellas
See, he's not wearing a tie
Well, he's a patent attorney
Maybe his tie is pending
So, I've reviewed your paperwork,
and it seems like we've got everything we need
to file a patent
for your infinite persistence gyroscope
That's great! Excellent
So what happens next?
Well, the legal team needs to review
existing patents to avoid overlap
Oh, I don't think there will be
Yes, we did our own search
That's nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough
(chuckles): Get a load of this guy
Can you imagine if we make money with this?
If we do, I am splurging
on the best sinus irrigator money can buy
That old sad story--
guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose
Just need you to review and sign this document
acknowledging that you understand the university
will own 75% of the patent
75%?
That's outrageous
This is our idea based on our research
How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?
It's university policy
I know when I'm beat
Hold on, hold on So the three of us
do all the work and only end up with 25%?
Dr Hofstadter, this university
has been paying your salaries for over ten years
Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?
Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda
And as far as Mr Wolowitz is concerned,
I'm afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA,
your name can be on the patent,
but you're not entitled to an ownership share
Wait, so this can turn out to be
a financial success, and I get nothing?
Well, sometimes they give you a plaque
Well, that's not fair
We should all get plaques
Sorry, but we can't sign this
Come on, let's go
Thank you for your time
Couple of questions about the plaque

(through static): I didn't understand your e-mail
Uh, can you repeat that? You're breaking up
I didn't understand your e-mail
Ah Yeah, I had to get a little creative
because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working
"Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be
to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?"
So, is that a yes?
Sheldon, why don't you get a new computer?
You know that one's out-of-date
Oh, but I like this computer
The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out
I'm sorry, I didn't get that
(through static): The video is failing,
and the sound is cutting out
I'm sorry, one more time The sound is cutting out
I can't read that!
The video is failing!
(through static): Get a new computer
What?
(through static): Get a new computer
What?!
(phone rings)
Hello?
Get a new computer!

SHELDON: It's nice to get back to nature
Why don't I do this more often?
What a beautiful forest
(gasps delightedly)
Hello, little butterfly
What's your Na
(screams)
Whatcha doing?
I was enjoying some virtual reality,
until you ruined it with your actual face
What am I smelling?
Oh, it's car air freshener
I was simulating the smell of the forest
That's not what the forest smells like
Well, how would I know?
Why are you pretending to be outdoors?
You hate it
Hmm? Oh
Amy showed me a compelling study
that demonstrated the cognitive benefit
of spending time in the wilderness
Buddy, I am ready to drive you
into the wilderness any time you want
and leave you there
Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants
who spent four days in the woods away from all technology
reported a 50% gain in reasoning skills upon their return
Okay, if that's true, why aren't there more genius squirrels?
You may need this more than I do

I have a question about Batman
Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat
Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid
Now,
if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime,
would he be Man-Batman?
No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat
But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman
that was bitten by a radioactive man?
But Batman is a man
You're talking about a man who would have the powers of a man
That's just Man-Man
Well, isn't Man-Man just Man?
But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?
Well, that's just Batman
No, if a man dresses as a bat,
that's Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat,
that's Batman-Man
(cell phone chimes)
So does that answer your question?
Oh, I haven't asked it yet
Oh, that's Claire Got to run
I thought you were back with Emily
Uh, actually I'm seeing both of them
You mean like through their window from behind a bush?
No, I'm actually dating two women
Later
(chuckles) Really?
The guy who for years couldn't even talk to women
is suddenly going out with two of them?
How is that possible? WOLOWITZ: I know
Scientists have tried to reproduce it
with computational models,
but, in each case, the world blows up
Seriously, that guy's dating two women?

Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend,
I won a night of wine tasting from work
That sounds fun Mm-hmm
How come scientists don't win free stuff like salespeople do?
'Cause we're not in it for the stuff
We're in it for the groupies
SHELDON: Personally,
I find the notion of external rewards demeaning
I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery
But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize
I also say don't contradict me in front of my friends,
but that you don't remember
All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go
I would love to
I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir
I'm sure that would pair nicely
with your fried nuggets of chicken
Well, it sounds like a nice night We should go
Wine again?
Yeah, no, thank you
I like my grapes the old-fashioned way:
in a juice box
Well, I'm going
You couldn't stop me from getting a massage at the mall,
and you're not stopping me now
I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend
get groped in public by another man
And I shouldn't have to see my boyfriend
riding on a train for children around the mall
The little choo-choo for toddlers?
And now you know why I needed the massage
Well, we're out
Bernie can't drink 'cause she's pregnant
And she's pregnant because we had sex
And we had sex because
(laughs): well, come on
It's okay You should go
You sure?
Of course
Yeah, give her a break from, Well, come on
Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it's you and me
Me? How? Why?
Well, it makes perfect sense
Because you're an expectant mother, you can't drink alcohol
I don't like to
You can't have sushi
I don't like to
You can't go in hot tubs
I consider them vats of sweaty people soup
Gee, Sheldon, I don't know
Oh, come on
Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs--
I've been avoiding these things all my life
And now, because you're pregnant, you have to
The difference is she's bringing life into the world,
and you suck it out
I guess we could give it a try
Well, little lady, you've heard of party hearty;
get ready to party hardly
I bet you'd like a drink right now
Helium
Yes Yes
Taylor Swift
Yes
Pi
Yes
Kardashian
More specific
Khloe?
Yes!
See, I remembered
because if it looks like Kim it's Kim,
if it looks kind of like Kim it's Kourtney,
and if it looks nothing like Kim it's Khloe
Oh
Oh,
that's a Venn Diagram, and I remember because
I thought to myself,
Venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?
What are you guys doing? Oh, well,
we decided to use our breakfast time
to expand our respective knowledge bases
Oh, let me try
Okay
Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop
I'm sorry, who is Mike Drop?
Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport
with me later to pick up my mother?
Sure Thanks
No problem Hey, Penny,
um, since you're already gonna be at the airport,
do I need to go?
Why don't you want to get your mother from the airport?
Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride
where she criticizes every aspect of my life
She can cover it in a car ride?
I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone
You really want me to pick up
your mother all by myself?
Hmm, I just feel like
it would be a good chance for you to bond
Or a way for you to avoid her?
I don't know what he's putting on those cards,
but you are smarter than ever
Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up
Seriously?
Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law,
and I'd like for us to have a good relationship
That is very mature of you,
so I'm gonna go ahead and say, Suckah
All right, back to learning Okay
Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy
Or as I know him
Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars 
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

Hey
Hi, how was the screening?
Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks
to make somebody who cut the line feel bad,
but only the white people felt bad
Ugh, I should've never bought him that coloring book
that explains Black History Month
How'd it go with my mother?
Uh, you know, it started a little rocky,
but I think we got to a good place
Wow
Well done (chuckles)
Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel,
she even gave me a hug
Did she think you were choking or
I'm sorry, that's great
Thank you for spending time with her
No problem
Um, so listen,
I don't know if you have any plans next weekend,
but I kind of promised your mom
we'd have another wedding ceremony
so she could attend this time
Wait, we're gonna get married again?
Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family
Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug
Come on, it'll be fun,
and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt
we didn't invite her to the first one
Look, in our defense,
it was kind of a spur of the moment thing,
and also, we don't like her
Leonard, come on, she's your mom
If we can do something to make her happy,
why wouldn't we?
I just said why--
we don't like her
Hey, look, then forget about her,
let's do it for us
We could keep it small and informal
This time we can invite our families
Is your brother out of prison?
Thanks to overcrowding, yeah
I'd love it if my dad could come
Oh, you have to invite him
I haven't seen him since the divorce
Oh, he's like a different man
Oh He stopped twitching,
and I think he grew an inch and a half
Well, then it's settled
Yay
God
So funny
I never thought my second marriage would be to you!
